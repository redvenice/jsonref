The Mail has obtained a copy of a ‘restraint order prohibiting disposal of assets’ served on him by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) under the Proceeds of Crime Act. The order threatens him with a fine or jail if he tries to sell his multi-million-pound homes or cherished fleet of supercars.Over 17 pages, the restraint order freezes no fewer than 14 bank accounts, and bans the sale of his Lamborghinis, Rolls-Royces and Bentleys, and seven property deeds. The order was issued by Judge Sarah Munro QC, sitting at the Old Bailey, on August 29. The hearing was private, and was not reported at the time. When the Mail tried to report on the existence of the order last December, Stunt’s lawyers obtained a court order that banned publication.          Stunning views: The block of flats overlooking the Thames in Chelsea Harbour          Luxury home: The cottage in Belgravia that was on the market in 2016 for £11.8mBut Stunt’s bid to gag the Press has backfired, after the Mail challenged the gagging order in court yesterday. It was overturned, meaning the Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings against the multi-millionaire can be revealed for the first time. The Act was introduced in 2002 to allow money or assets to be seized by the State if they were obtained through unlawful conduct. In Stunt’s case, he has not been charged with any offence, and it is not clear why the order has been made. His assets have not been seized, but their use has been restricted and he must not dispose of, deal with or diminish the value of them.It is understood that, since August, the restraint order has been subject to minor revisions on three occasions, to take account of Stunt’s business interests.In the original order, Judge Munro QC slapped a £1,000-a-week limit on him, saying: ‘This order does not prohibit the Alleged Offender from spending up to £1,000 a week towards his ordinary living expenses.’          Listed by the court: One of two Rolls-Royce Phantoms. Stunt recently bragged of owning 200 cars and boasted that losing £5million in a casino meant nothing to him.          Stunt is being forced to live considerably more frugally these days – on the orders of a judge (pictured: His favourite supercar, the Lamborghini Aventador)It is a far cry from his days of splashing the cash. His costly and acrimonious orce from Miss Ecclestone in 2017 did not dent his penchant for shopping trips to Harrods in a cavalcade of supercars. In March last year, he declared to Tatler magazine that he is ‘as rich as ever’.He said he had once had a £5million credit line at ‘every casino’ in London, Monaco, Las Vegas and Macao but had recently cut his wagers to ‘just’ £20,000 a night, explaining: ‘Me fooling around with £20,000, I’m not trying to sound as if I don’t know the value of money, but it’s a huge improvement on losing £5million a night. You have to bet enough to hurt you, but I definitely had a gambling problem. I was losing millions every time.’Interviewed at home by the high-society magazine, while wearing a £60,000 Audemars Piguet gold wristwatch, he showed off some of his paintings including a Van Gogh, a Constable, a Picasso and several Van Dycks.These are likely to be among the list of artworks that Stunt has been ordered to draw up by the court. The judge demanded he itemise all of his ‘paintings, furniture, watches, jewellery and objets d’art’, along with their estimated value, photographs and locations where they are held.          Audemars Piguet gold watch: Stunt has one worth £60,000 in his collection          The gold bullion magnate is the ex-husband of Formula One heiress Petra Ecclestone, with whom he has three children (pictured: His Bentley Mulsanne)          Rolls-Royce Phantom: The other in Stunt’s collection. Stunt has also spent millions on artworksStunt has spent millions on artworks. His bodyguards have been spotted carrying bubble-wrapped masterpieces from Sotheby’s and Christie’s to Rolls-Royces parked on yellow lines outside.He has lent paintings by Monet, Dali, Picasso and Constable to galleries around the world. Even Prince Charles accepted paintings on loan for the restoration of his Scottish stately home Dumfries House, and Stunt has several royal letters of gratitude on display at his Mayfair office.Two months ago, in line with good journalistic practice, the Mail gave Stunt a chance to comment before publication. A security guard answering the door of his stucco-fronted Belgravia cottage said he was unavailable, but accepted a letter to him offering an opportunity to comment. Instead of doing so, Stunt went straight to a judge.Later that day, Old Bailey Judge Mark Dennis QC granted an order to ‘prohibit publication of all information’ relating to the assets freezing order. Yesterday, Judge Dennis threw out the gagging order, and suggested Stunt had been trying to protect his ‘personal, reputational or personal business interests’, none of which was relevant to the Proceeds of Crime proceedings. The CPS has declined to comment.          Used by his security team: One of two Range Rovers. He told Tattler he liked to travel in ‘an armada of cars’ on shopping trips round London          Bentley Flying Spur: Stunt claims to own 200 carsStunt has repeatedly stoked controversy. During his £5billion orce, he was claimed to have rubbed cocaine on his gums during a court hearing. On the same day in June 2017, it is also claimed he barged into his father-in-law, the ex-Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone, and made a gun gesture towards him in court. He later made an obscene gesture at photographers as he left the hearing. Stunt has ‘categorically denied’ all these allegations, calling them ‘completely ridiculous’.Around that time, Stunt was photographed sitting in the back of a Rolls-Royce with Terry Adams, the ‘Godfather’ of Britain’s most notorious crime family which has been linked to 25 murders, money laundering, racketeering and extortion.Adams is also Stunt’s godfather. Stunt has spoken of his pride at being his godson. There is no suggestion he is involved in any of Adams’s affairs.          Wine collection: A bottle of Chateau PetrusThe assets which have been frozen by the court offer a fascinating glimpse into Stunt’s wealth. Among other things, the Proceeds of Crime order lists his cars and their personalised number plates – all variations on his surname.Supercars Stunt is banned from selling the following cars: Bentley Flying Spur, registration S4UNT Range Rover S2UNT Lamborghini Countach 157UNT Rolls-Royce Phantom 57UNT, Lamborghini Aventador S7UNT, Range Rover S1UNT, Rolls-Royce Phantom S3UNT, Lamborghini Aventador S1VNT, Bentley Mulsanne S6UNT.He has bragged that he owns more than 200 high-performance cars, mainly stored in hangars in California and the UK.He told Tattler he liked to travel in ‘an armada of cars’ on shopping trips round London, typically in a Lamborghini sandwiched by two Rolls-Royces and two Range Rovers as, he claims, it would embarrass him to have his 25-strong security team trail him in Ford Fiestas.Stunt once boasted to Bernie Ecclestone that his £600,000 Rolls-Royce Mansory Conquistador was the only one in the world.Apartments The court order imposes a freeze on two entire floors of a luxury apartment block next to the Thames. Stunt paid £3.3million for the first flat, in 2012, and a further £3.4million for the apartment directly beneath it, in 2015.Deeds for the two properties, publicly available via the Land Registry, have been recently amended to show that a court order prevents any sale without the permission of ‘the CPS Proceeds of Crime Central Pre-Enforcement Unit’. They also show that a bankruptcy notice was filed at the High Court in October this year.£11m cottage Stunt’s stucco-fronted four-storey Belgravia cottage has four double-bedroom suites, wine cellar, roof terrace, cinema, gym and steam room. Bought via one of his companies for £2.7million in 2011 – he boasted he paid cash – it was put back on the market in 2016 for £11.8million but did not sell.          The court order also demanded that Stunt draw up a list of all his art. Pictured is one of his entourage on an art-buying spree in July 2015 Land Two small plots in Stunt’s name close to Dartmouth Castle in Devon are identified in the order. Bizarrely, the plots in a patch of woodland are tiny – each less than eight inches by eight inches.MoneyThe order freezes no fewer than 14 bank accounts in the names of James Stunt or Stunt \u0026amp Co Ltd. They comprise nine accounts at Barclays, four at Lloyds and one at a Mayfair wealth management firm.WineStunt is banned from selling his Corney \u0026amp Barrow fine wine collection. The 230-year-old London-based firm is one of the oldest independent wine merchants in the UK. It is currently selling a case of 12 bottles of Petrus 1982 for £51,000.Art The court order also demanded that Stunt draw up a list of all his ‘paintings, furniture, watches, jewellery and objets d’art’ and itemise their estimated value and locations where they are held."},{"url":null,"title":"Shamima Begums baby taken Loose Womens Denise Welch tells viewers","story":"Denise Welch (right) has waded into the jihadi schoolgirl controversy by saying her baby should be taken off her, while Gemma Atkinson (left)  says the jihadi schoolgirl should not be allowed back into the UK          They are the latest celebrities to offer their views on 19-year-old Shamima Begum (pictured) who is begging to return home after fleeing to Syria to join the Islamic State in 2015She said: \u0027I do believe the baby should be taken from her and I believe the baby should be placed with a family that has nothing to do with that family.\u0027  And the star went on to say the runaway schoolgirl has shown \u0027no remorse\u0027 and was \u0027still in love\u0027 with her jihadi husband. Jihadi bride Shamima Begum says she is willing to go to JAIL...Share this articleOther panelists disagreed with the ex-Coronation Street actress, including singer Gabrielle who supported the ISIS schoolgirl\u0027s cause.She said: \u0027We are a humane country - we should have her back.

A teenager has hatched a duckling from a Waitrose egg.William Atkins, 14, decided to test a claim that it is possible to hatch a supermarket egg under the right conditions.And 28 days after buying half a dozen duck eggs, he was rewarded with the birth of a fluffy duckling.Cradling the week-old chick, which will be called Jeremy or Jemima once its sex has been determined, William said: ‘The duckling is absolutely adorable and already making little quacking noises. I am amazed a supermarket egg has actually hatched. But also really excited.’The schoolboy from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, bought the £2.30 Gladys-May’s Braddock Whites free range duck eggs and placed them under a £40 incubator bought from eBay in his bedroom.Three days later he was stunned when after shining a torch on to the shells, he saw a beating heart.           Almost a month after buying half a dozen duck eggs, he was rewarded with the birth of a fluffy duckling. When it grows a little larger, the duckling will go to live at a nearby farm where there are rescue ducks and a pondHe said: ‘From then on the unborn duckling grew bigger inside the shell every day.

It is unusual, probably unique, in that it offers three years of art studies which are free of charge. This year 767 people applied for the 17 places on offer.Christopher Le Brun, president of the RA, said the school was one of the organisation’s founding purposes and the gift of money would ensure its continuation for the next 250 years.He said the artists and architects who run the RA want the education side of its operations to be better known. “The general perception is that we are a set of exhibition galleries with the most wonderful exhibition programme you can imagine … the academy as an academy had somehow slipped out of sight.”The RA has costed the necessary improvements – which cover everything from new plumbing and electrics to providing a better library – at £15m.The gift comes from a charitable fund in the name of Julia and Hans Rausing, one of Britain’s richest men. He hit the headlines in 2012 when the body of his drugs-dependent first wife Eva was discovered under several feet of duvets, blankets, tarpaulin and TV screens in their vast Chelsea home.Her body had lain there for about two months. The reclusive Rausing hid his wife, he said, because he could not face her being dead. He was given a suspended prison sentence for preventing the lawful burial of her body.Rausing married Christie’s art expert Julia Delves Broughton in 2014. The couple’s charitable fund has given over 220 grants totalling more than £185m since it was founded.Rebecca Salter, Keeper of the RA, said the Rausing gift would allow restoration and renewal of the campus: “This is unashamedly not an expansion of the RA Schools, we are small, we are free and we are going to stay that way.”The RA has been run on the same principles for 250 years, with money raised by the annual Summer Exhibition going towards providing the school’s free art education.Kira Freije, who graduated in 2016, said the RA course gives you an opportunity to fail as an artist, and time to recover: “I graduated feeling equipped with the right attitude and ambition to pursue whatever comes next.”The plan is to begin work in 2021 and keep students at the school while it is carried out around them in phases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b468efff2be44970291deccdf09b459e4a31997d/0_187_5710_3428/master/5710.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dec50db8185a5ece3e192bbb694442a8","title":"black panthers photo gallery 1960s san francisco art institute","story":"An exhibition at the San Francisco Art Institute takes a new look at Pirkle Jones and Ruth-Marion Baruch’s controversial 1968 photo essay, which sought to enhance public understanding of the Black Panthers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9446ad71d2e93c64b2dd97529e17f30c8d62b7e2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f54f2a76ee689033946f82f24d9c9dc6","title":"carnegie medal longlist highlights trend for gritty childrens books","story":"Twenty books in contention for this year’s £5,000 award encompass stories of bereavement, isolation and marginalisationFrom a girl’s exploration of her Taiwanese heritage following her mother’s suicide to the story of two young carers whose mother is terminally ill, the 2019 longlist for the Carnegie medal rides a wave of children’s books about marginalisation and isolation, poverty and bereavement.First won by Arthur Ransome for one of his Swallows and Amazons adventure novels in 1936, the UK’s most prestigious award for children’s books this year encompasses a range topics including depression, assisted dying and gun violence. Novels in the running include The Astonishing Colour of After by Emily XR Pan and Brian Conaghan’s The Weight of a Thousand Feathers, which both deal with the death of a mother Onjali Q Raúf’s The Boy at the Back of the Class, about a Syrian refugee living in the UK Emily Thomas’s Mud, about a girl living on a Thames sailing barge with an alcoholic father and Candy Gourlay’s Bone Talk, which follows a Filipino boy whose tribe is at risk from a US invasion in 1899.After reading 254 novels to come up with the lineup, chair of judges Alison Brumwell pointed to a “theme of dealing with being marginalised and isolated”, as well as poverty and bereavement, in children’s fiction over the last year. “These were very strong narrative themes, regardless of the structure the writers employed,” she said.This year’s longlist also features a high proportion of poetry: four verse novels make the 20-strong lineup, including three Americans – Kwame Alexander’s coming-of-age tale, Rebound Jason Reynolds’s Long Way Down and Elizabeth Acevedo’s debut The Poet X, about a Dominican-American growing up in Harlem – in addition to former winner Sarah Crossan’s Moonrise, about a teenager’s visit to his older brother on death row.The longlist, chosen by a panel of librarians, also features novels from a host of former Carnegie medallists including David Almond, Crossan, Sally Gardner and Philip Reeve. Robert Macfarlane and Jackie Morris’s The Lost Words, a poetry collection celebrating the natural world, makes the longlist for both the Carnegie and the Kate Greenaway medal for an illustrated book, as does Kevin Crossley-Holland and Jeffrey Alan Love’s Norse Myths.“The authors and illustrators recognised this year for their outstanding achievements have produced works which entertain, challenge, inspire, and even outrage,” said Brumwell. “The 40 books selected by judges offer intimate insights into family life, superb world-building and thoughtful, incisive explorations of complex themes and issues. Young readers have the opportunity to encounter characters in a erse range of narratives who both reflect their own experiences and build empathy for different ways of living.”Last year CILIP, the librarians’ association that manages the prizes each year, welcomed the findings of an independent ersity review, which was prompted by outrage at the all-white longlist in 2017. The prize has never been won by a black, Asian or minority ethnic writer.The winners of the Carnegie and the Kate Greenaway awards will receive £5,000 each, plus £500 of books to donate to their local library and a gold medal. The shortlists will be announced on 19 March and the winners on 18 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52e02b67e151393e2621058697167a010485c95c/0_61_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8d7687e22ec436224eb369c5a9b6d24","title":"carmaker honda plans to close swindon factory reports","story":"Japanese firm to shut plant in 2022 but maintain its European HQ near Bracknell in BerkshireHonda is planning to close its factory in Swindon, dealing what trade unions called a “shattering body blow” to the UK automotive sector, which is already wrestling with the effects of Brexit-related uncertainty.The Japanese carmaker is expected to announce as early as Tuesday that it is planning to shut its Swindon plant in 2022, in a move that would put 3,500 jobs at its only European production site at risk and threaten many more in its supply chain.Honda is expected to move production back to Japan, partly because it can guarantee tariff-free exports to the EU, according to Sky News.Honda said: “At this point, we are not able to make any comments regarding the speculation. We take our responsibilities to our associates very seriously and will always communicate any significant news with them first.”The loss of the Honda plant follows previous warnings about the impact of a no-deal Brexit from Britain’s largest automotive firm, Jaguar Land Rover, as well as Ford, Toyota, Nissan and BMW.Several of the firms have also pointed to a slowdown in demand from China, as well as slumping diesel sales caused by the continuing fallout from the “Dieselgate” emissions data-rigging scandal.Earlier this month, Nissan ditched plans to build its new X-Trail SUV in Sunderland, while Ford has said it will shed 1,000 jobs as part of a wider European cost-cutting plan.Jaguar Land Rover has cited Brexit among the factors in its own 4,500 job cuts, while Toyota and BMW have said production sites could close in a no-deal scenario.However, Justin Tomlinson, the North Swindon Conservative MP whose constituency includes the plant, said he had spoken to the company and insisted its decision was “due to global trends and not Brexit”.Last month Tomlinson, a vocal Brexit supporter, tweeted that Honda was preparing for any scenario and was “committed” to Swindon.However, Honda has also previously voiced concern about the impact a hard Brexit could have on the “just-in-time” manufacturing processes crucial to the automotive sector, potentially costing the company millions of pounds.Japan’s ambassador warned last year that the UK would not find a better trade deal than it has access to as a member of the European single market, while the EU and Japan signed the world’s biggest ever free-trade agreement last year. It came into force at the start of this month, sparking concern that British businesses could lose out as a result.Britain’s largest trade union Unite said the closure of the Swindon plant would be a “shattering body blow at the heart of UK manufacturing”.Des Quinn, the union’s national officer for the automotive sector, called for an urgent statement from business minister Greg Clark.“The car industry in the UK over the last two decades has been the jewel in the crown for the manufacturing sector – and now it has been brought low by the chaotic Brexit uncertainty created by the rigid approach adopted by prime minister Theresa May,” he said.“We are seeking urgent clarification from Honda on the implications of these serious reports. The 3,500-strong workforce do skilled, well paid jobs that the UK can ill-afford to lose.“If the government had advance warning of this dreadful news and did not alert the unions, this is an appalling and cavalier attitude by ministers.”A source close to Honda told Sky News the carmaker would maintain its European headquarters near Bracknell, Berkshire, as well as its UK-based Formula One team, but that the Swindon factory would close.Honda’s announcement comes with no sign of a Brexit deal in place just weeks ahead of the 29 March date on which the UK is set to leave.A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it was unable to comment on speculation.The Labour MP Rachel Reeves, chair of the business select committee, said: “The PM now needs to rule out no deal immediately and keep us in the single market and customs union rather than risk further fatal damage to our car industry.“Japan and the EU have a free-trade agreement, guaranteeing tariff free access. It would be an act of folly to toss that away, along with friction-free access to the EU market, in the forlorn hope that we could negotiate a better deal.”Pernille Rudlin, whose Rudlin Consulting firm advises Japanese businesses, warned that many more jobs could be lost at companies in Honda’s supply chain if Swindon closed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0182deaa9014853d6526c694f3120fc7648a713a/20_191_3720_2232/master/3720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfdd99dc2ed0a496e6ec4a0af88c29df","title":"flybmi appoints bdo as administrators after ceasing operations","story":"BDO keen to ensure customers, staff and suppliers are supported through processNearly 400 employees at Flybmi have lost their jobs following the collapse of the regional British airline at the weekend.Flybmi formally appointed the restructuring firm BDO as administrators on Monday after ceasing to trade on Saturday. BDO announced that 376 employees in the UK, Germany, Sweden and Belgium have been made redundant, although some will assist with the administration.The airline’s immediate owner, British Midland Regional, operated 17 regional jet aircraft on routes to 25 European cities but cancelled hundreds of flights at short notice over the weekend, leaving passengers stranded.Thousands of passengers have been left out of pocket after the collapse of the airline, which operated more than 600 flights a week from regional airports including Bristol, Newcastle, Aberdeen and east Midlands.Tony Nygate, BDO business restructuring partner and joint administrator, said: “As joint administrators, we are taking all necessary steps to ensure customers, staff and suppliers are supported through the administration process. Our job is to maximise recoveries and minimise distress for all parties, acting as smoothly and swiftly as possible.“Customers can find information on the flybmi website regarding the steps they need to take to apply for a refund from their payment provider or travel company. We are also working with the company’s employees to provide them with guidance on how to make a claim for monies which may be due to them. In addition, we are contacting suppliers to explain how to apply for monies owed to them.”Administrators will now evaluate Flybmi’s assets, including its former headquarters at Castle Donington, to work out how much it can return to creditors, including suppliers of fuel and food. It is thought to be highly unlikely that people who bought tickets for cancelled flights, who rank as unsecured creditors, will recover any money.Some passengers are able to rebook via partner airlines Lufthansa, Brussels Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Loganair, Air France and Air Dolomiti, which have “shared ticket” flights with Flybmi. Ryanair and easyJet are also offering cheap rescue flights on some routes.The group’s ultimate parent company, Airline Investments, which is owned by brothers Stephen and Peter Bond, is continuing to trade, as is its sister firm, Loganair, which has said it will step in and take over five of Flybmi’s routes from next month.Loganair, which is headquartered in Glasgow and operates routes including around the Scottish Highlands and Islands, said it was in a strong financial position and would be flying from Aberdeen to Bristol, Oslo and Esbjerg, as well as from Newcastle to Brussels and to Stavanger in Norway. It was also “evaluating Flybmi’s wider network”.The collapse of Flybmi threatened the continued operation of flights between Derry, in Northern Ireland, and London’s Stansted airport. Before Flybmi’s collapse the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, said the government would continue to subsidise the route, which is seen as economically important for Derry, until 2021.The operator of City of Derry airport said on Monday a number of airlines, including Loganair, had expressed interest in running the route.Flybmi is the latest of a series of European airlines to struggle in recent months. Fellow British regional carrier Flybe was taken over in a cut-price deal led by Virgin Atlantic in January, while low-cost carrier Norwegian launched an emergency £270m fundraising at the end of the month when a possible takeover by British Airways owner International Airlines Group fell through.The airline said its trading and future prospects had been “seriously affected by the uncertainty created by the Brexit process”. Rising fuel prices and increasing carbon costs resulting from the EU’s recent decision to exclude UK airlines from full participation in the emissions trading scheme had also contributed to the demise of the company."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ead1d6402c2c9a2f09172b58fdcb7e44dce780a/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2310d79c97a4ee229f98f394324b22bd","title":"did you work for a uk high street chain that has closed","story":"For an upcoming project, we would like to hear from former workers of chain shops that shut about how it affected their livesWith thousands of high street shops closing over the last decade, communities have been rightly concerned about the decline and what the future holds.If you worked for a high street chain that shut down, we’d like to hear from you.

It may yet break apart the moribund political system. But that seismic rupture didn’t happen today when seven MPs walked out of the Labour party.Seven is a pitifully small number. The timing is monstrously badly judged and the reasons the MPs give are oddly scattergun, lacking political punch and focus. To be sure, they are not alone in thinking Jeremy Corbyn a weak leader with many failings: his poll ratings show most of the country agrees, as did the 172 Labour MPs who voted no confidence in him two and half years ago, as his “kinder gentler politics” turned poisonous.But whether born of despair or vanity, this walkout is a damaging distraction, because right here, right now, there is only one cause that matters – Brexit. That’s not one issue among many, it is the great question that has the nation’s future hanging by a thread. It is the debate that contains within it all the other arguments about Britain’s ideals, identities, ideologies and insanities.Those other MPs who tried to oust Corbyn still think much the same of him now as they did then. But they have not quit, not at this catastrophically inappropriate juncture, erting attention from the supreme task of this generation of politicians. The best of them, such as Peter Kyle and Yvette Cooper, are stuck deep into battle to rescue us from calamity: Labour will again back Cooper’s amendment next week to prevent a no-deal crash-out and delay withdrawal. Some of those 35 Labour MPs who failed to back it last time are being brought round, giving it a good chance of success.It does of course madden many Labour MPs that foot-dragging Corbyn has been almost absent from the fight against this Tory Brexit disaster. With him surrounded, if not held captive, by a cabal of Len McCluskey’s people, you only had to listen to the Unite leader’s infuriating pro-Brexit views on the Peston show last week to suspect he spoke the Labour leader’s mind too. Their views are deep-frozen in the 1970s. But what matters is less what Corbyn privately thinks than what he does when it comes to crunch Brexit votes – and so far, there has been no misstep.Labour MPs walking away at this point only give succour to those Labour pro-Brexiters,such as Caroline Flint, who caricature those in favour of reversing Brexit as members of “metropolitan elites”. Paradoxically, their defection hardened the resolve of scores of Labour MPs to stay, those who in the past considered splitting. They are the ones most angry at the defectors, accusing them of failing to work hard enough in their constituencies, failing to build around themselves loyal teams to fight off marauders. The one who has their sympathy is Luciana Berger, bombarded with antisemitic abuse and forced to fight off deselection when about to give birth.This walkout comes as a head of steam is building up within Labour at Corbyn appearing to dodge his party’s conference policy to back a referendum. Corbyn’s own Momentum movement has been expressing its frustration at their leader’s reluctance to get behind a people’s vote. Labour has been haemorrhaging members, old and new, over Brexit. Wherever I go, Labour people tell me they are struggling to persuade members not to tear up their cards. “Don’t do it!” they say. “Stay and fight for Labour to take the right stand on Brexit. Corbyn won’t be there much longer: stay to select the next leader, don’t abandon us.”Does this feel at all like 1981 and the creation of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which broke away from Michael Foot’s Labour? Not a jot. I was there and there is no comparison. These seven lack anyone of the stature, public recognition or intellectual heft of the SDP leaders. The Gang of Four between them had all held serious government office – between them they had occupied the roles of chancellor, home secretary, foreign secretary, education and transport secretary. This grouplet does not have that kind of weight and it lacks ideological substance and ideas. Corbyn’s failure to stamp out antisemitism is a just cause, but why not stay to fight it? Remember, the SDP defectors left not out of irritation with an inadequate leader, but because they could not and would not stand on Foot’s manifesto that pledged to leave the EU and Nato.Compare that to Corbyn and John McDonnell’s last manifesto, which was widely popular, with no ideological deal-breakers for a broad church party. Some might query costings or priorities – why billions for middle-class students, not for needy toddlers in Sure Starts? Some might niggle at the practicalities of utility renationalisation – but these were popular policies. Nothing there felt like an updated version of the notorious 1981 manifesto, dubbed the “longest suicide note in history”. These seven defectors were vague on reasons for jumping ship, beyond wishing for a better leader.Philip Collins , a former speechwriter for Tony Blair, has written a good manifesto for a putative new social democratic party, entitled Start Again. But since almost any Labour MP would back almost all of it, that suggests less need for a new party than for one better led. Brexit could still destroy Labour. The 2017 manifesto got away with promising “the benefits of the single market and the customs union”. Since then, Keir Starmer has deftly led the party to vote the right way on every Brexit ision. So far so good.But now Corbyn needs to back the Peter KylePhil Wilson clever compromise. Their plan is for MPs to agree to pass Theresa May’s bad deal, but only on condition it is put to the voters for a final decision. People on both sides of the ide are gathering round this option as the best chance of resolving Brexit, once and for all, whenever May finally holds her meaningful vote. The plan lets MPs in Brexit-voting seats obey their electorate by voting for May’s Brexit – but frees them to campaign to remain in a referendum. The good signs are that McDonnell and Starmer are warming to the plan. This will be Corbyn’s vital test: in the end he will have no choice but to do the right thing.If the Labour leader ends up in any way enabling Brexit if as a modern-day Ramsay MacDonald he makes Labour complicit in this historic Tory catastrophe, then expect all hell to break loose in the party. If he goes against the will of his party, the great majority of his voters and his MPs, the party will break apart – and so it should. But that hasn’t happened. These seven are jumping a gun that may never be fired. They will find it cold out there. I know that from experience. So deep was the SDPLabour split that sitting in the  canteen, Labourites picked up their plates and walked away from us SDP-ites. Schism is bitter and personal.

Six political commentators give their verdictThis is the saddest of days for the Labour party and everyone who needs us. For years we’ve been locked in an angry tug of war, and this is where it’s brought us. And at a time when poverty, homelessness, mental ill health and crumbling public services have pushed thousands to breaking point. People have never needed us more.For 126 years our strength has been in the ersity of a movement that inspires fierce debate across the grassroots and the highest levels. Our breadth gives us reach into very different communities and the ability to hear what they are telling us. At times we have fallen short, but, at our best, we inspire people to debate, argue and participate. Even through the Iraq war years we were home to politicians as erse as Jeremy Corbyn and Tony Blair. Dissenting politicians have found ways to stand by Labour values even in such fraught times.The MPs who left today have different motives and beliefs. Some never accepted the current leader, others served in his shadow cabinet. But a response to this that seeks to attack and condemn speaks of an unwillingness to listen, learn or compromise. We are in danger of becoming incapable of accommodating alternative points of view.Growing intolerance has spread like a cancer across the political spectrum, but its existence in the Labour party is a genuine threat to our survival. Our members join the party to fight for a more compassionate, equal and tolerant country. How do we convince the public we can create that country if we don’t live, fight for and uphold those values ourselves?There is strength in humility, generosity and compassion. As the Brexit deadline looms and we face a looming national crisis, we will not be forgiven for spending more time looking inwards. The blame game that has erupted is a hopeless dead end for us and for the country. We have to do better.• Lisa Nandy is Labour MP for WiganA rushed press conference, a lineup that surprised no one, and a name and branding exercise that promises not to bother so much as the third page of Google. Splits have been mooted since the very advent of Corbynism, especially since the second leadership election put paid to the idea that the route back to rule for Continuity Blairities was via the membership. The general election in 2017 returned a far greater turnout for Labour than MPs like Chris Leslie and Chuka Umunna had mooted, and seemed to temporarily quell attempts to restart a leadership contest.But as Monday’s press conference shows, the philosophical tussle remains at the heart of the party, but it is less concerned with what the future of Labour should be than how politics itself should function. Labour has always been a broad church: it held John McDonnell, Jeremy Corbyn and many other socialist members of the Labour Representation Committee within its ranks while voting for war in Iraq, and letting private finance initiatives overtake hospitals. Those tensions have always bubbled up: these seven MPs are now discovering how it feels to be sidelined and consigned to the backbench.Their decision to start their own splinter group is a refusal to accept that role. They won’t see any more decision-making ability – that’s not the aim – but they hope to grab as many headlines as possible. In breaking away, they accept the fact that doing so jeopardises a potential Labour government: numbers are tight, regardless, and pulling a handful of MPs away is designed to either block a Labour government, and lead to decades of Conservative rule, or secure a confidence-and-supply deal akin to that enjoyed by the Democratic Unionist party, and greater influence as a result.Real, transformative social change in the first-past-the-post system requires a majority government. The breakaway seven today have publicly made clear they are willing to see a continuation of deliberate poverty, benefit sanctions, the cruelty of universal credit, and economic mismanagement, rather than accept politics has changed and the terms in which they entered parliament have altered. If Coffey, Smith, Gapes et al had the courage of their convictions and were truly honest about their aims, they would stand for their seats in by-elections: winning would send a clear message to Corbyn and McDonnell that they have their constituents’ backing.But they will not: this is a vanity exercise, and the most high-profile example of political toys being thrown from the pram yet. Many MPs will be watching this spectacle and staunchly steering clear.Politics is broken, we all know that. We are completely stuck. The two-party system strangles any innovation at birth. It has calcified in the last few years into total crisis. Representative democracy is not working in any meaningful way. We sit agog as deals are done, bungs offered and amendments made. Both main parties are in hock to their extremists and to unelected advisors, from Lynton Crosby to Seumas Milne.Those who can watch a heavily pregnant Jewish woman saying that she has been bullied out of the Labour party, that this party is institutionally racist, and think nothing of it – all while she is being abused right now on social media – need to take a long, hard look themselves. Don’t bleat on about the moral integrity of some future socialism when this is what’s happening now. Antisemitism and the leadership’s position on Russia and Venezuela are not uppermost on the doorstep. Not even Brexit is. It’s housing, jobs and hospitals – all of which are good reason to want a Labour government. But at what price? Sometimes you have to ask who your fellow travellers are, and what they are asking you to go along with. We can all spout on about ending neoliberalism. It’s harder to understand how Labour might end the barrage of abuse its women and Jewish MPs face.The viciousness of attacks on anyone who doesn’t worship Corbyn, this continued cry of “centrist” as a meaningless insult, the personal attacks on this gang of seven: all that is but babble to the average voter. The repeated comparison to the SDP seems meaningless. That was a long time ago and we are in a vastly different era. Blame will now be apportioned – whether the idea is to set up a new party, join with rogue Tories, or not. The point is to be true to oneself. Right now, many MPs cannot say they are. They are huddling together like penguins in the frozen Antarctic hoping for the weather to change. They are inert, powerless and unhappy.It may be old-fashioned to want our politicians to stick to their beliefs, but then I am old-fashioned. If people standing up for what they believe is now seen as sad and disloyal, as both a power grab and a damp squib, then Labour needs to look at itself. A broken system cannot be fixed by those who keep their heads down. I saw that some hard and necessary truth was spoken on Monday, and if that can’t be tolerated, or even listened to, that tells us all we need to know.I have been disenfranchised. My Labour MP, Chuka Umunna, who represents the Streatham constituency, and whom I and 38,000 others voted for less than two years ago, has quit the party and set up in centrist alliance with six others. That 38,000 figure is itself 12,000 greater than in 2015: and those extra voters can be attributed directly to the Corbyn effect – the impact of the Labour leader Umunna has always opposed, yet who galvanised support and won an extra 3.5m votes across the country within two years of taking office.Umunna talked of intolerance within the party, bringing up his own his Irish-Nigerian heritage. Yet it’s Corbyn who has brought minorities into his frontbench in unprecedented numbers – the New Labour years by contrast were conspicuous by their whiteness. (Ironically, though the party was far more institutionally racist in those days, Umunna, who’s so quick to attack Corbyn on this, barely raised a murmur against Blair, Brown or Miliband). And Corbyn, who has always embraced multicultural Britain, won massive support among black and Asian voters in 2017, including many in Streatham.Umunna is entitled to leave the party: it’s become clearer over time that his views are increasingly out of step with modern voters – his cosying up to the wealthy, and his non-opposition to austerity were not in line with the direction Labour’s leadership was taking. I’d rather Umunna stayed in the party even better, I’d rather he realised how out of touch he’s become and start to represent his constituents and party members better. But if he leaves Labour he has a duty to stand down as MP and let constituents decide whether they want his kind of politics to represent us.It’s ironic that, when asked about whether the MPs should step down, rebel Chris Leslie said we don’t need more elections right now: this from the man who’s spent the last two years campaigning for a second referendum. If these seven really believe in what they’re saying, and all they say about democracy, they should let voters decide.Why won’t they? Because, despite all they claim about Corbyn’s unelectability, they know that he’s far more in touch with voters than they are: and that, in an election, there’d only be one winner.• Joseph Harker is the ’s deputy opinion editor.No one could watch the seven MPs departing Labour on Monday morning, and doubt it was an agonising decision for any of them. Together, they launched a damning indictment of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party and the contemporary political system. While there was much criticism of the left ideology of the current leadership, that hasn’t in truth changed much in recent years. Two things will have pushed them over the edge. First, the Labour party’s failure to adequately deal with complaints of antisemitism within its own ranks. In a powerful and brave statement, a pregnant Luciana Berger, who has faced months of disgusting abuse and deselection threats from her own party, stated that the party is “institutionally antisemitic” and that she has become embarrassed and ashamed to be part of it. Second, Corbyn’s failure to take a more anti-Brexit stance, and back a second referendum, given the impact Brexit will have in widening gaps between the least and most prosperous parts of the country.While those loyal to Corbyn are already painting this as a cynical move by a small group of MPs facing deselection threats, it was clearly a matter of conscience. It’s a huge problem for Jeremy Corbyn that under his leadership, the Labour party is an insufficiently broad church to accommodate these MPs. And who would have thought 10 years ago a group of MPs would be departing a party rightly proud of its anti-racist history, accusing it of institutional racism? It should prompt much reflection from Corbyn and his allies.In today’s uncertain political climate, this small group of independents may well pick up a few MPs from the Tory ranks and have a greater impact on Brexit and British politics than one might expect from their numbers in the coming months. But the truth is that under our first-past-the-post electoral system, their medium-term electoral fortunes look less than bright. At least if they lose at the next election, they will depart British politics knowing that they had the courage to speak out for what they believe is right.• Sonia Sodha is deputy opinion editor at the It’s rare for the Tories to have a good news day in the current climate but Monday morning’s announcement appears to be just that. The news of seven resignations in protest against Jeremy Corbyn’s position on antisemitism and Labour’s Brexit position has been greeted in the Conservative party with cautious optimism.The hope is that the MPs’ new outfit – the Independent Group – could play a pivotal role in stopping Corbyn from coming to power. With these MPs expected to stand as independents at the next election, it could split the Labour vote and help the Tories in key marginal seats. One of the reasons Labour did so well in the 2017 snap election was that the party became a repository for anti-Tory votes. If even a small percentage of those votes now go to the Independent Group, it could give the Tories a crucial boost.It’s of particular cheer to Conservative brains that one of the splitters, Chris Leslie, used his speech at the press conference to strike a pro-EU tone and criticise Labour’s “betrayal of Europe”. This is because the Conservative party now relies so heavily on leave voters that a party that appeals to remain is seen as little threat to their vote share.But that’s not to say it’s without risk for May’s Tories. Senior government figures believe that, where the Labour moderates have gone, Tory remainers could now follow. MPs on the watchlist include Sarah Wollaston, Heidi Allen and Anna Soubry. The fact that a number of Conservative MPs are currently facing deselection threats of their own over their remain position could act as a trigger to other MPs choosing to leave.But so long as the Conservatives can keep any losses to a small handful of MPs then the creation of the Independent Group will be seen as a win for the Tories.• Katy Balls is the Spectator’s deputy political editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9254dc3b5b0807ee42f4520cfb2e2000bed4199f/0_64_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf417f635d01fa70542ae50f510d3e54","title":"the guardian view on facebook the arrogance of power","story":"Politicians across the spectrum are now agreed that the powers of the big tech companies must be curbed. The surveillance economy appears as an existential threat to democracy. Self-regulation is no longer enough. But it is a long way from sentiment to policy. Monday’s report from the digital, culture, media and sport select committee set out a path. In this work it has had no help from the companies it believes need regulating.Facebook, in particular, has shown itself to be arrogant and dishonest. Not only did Mark Zuckerberg refuse to present himself to the committee, as even Rupert Murdoch has done: the underlings he sent in his place gave misleading or untrue accounts. To quote the report: “Facebook seems willing neither to be regulated nor scrutinised … Facebook intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws … We consider that data transfer for value is Facebook’s business model and that Mark Zuckerberg’s statement that ‘we’ve never sold anyone’s data’ is simply untrue.”But the problem is wider than just one company. Google and YouTube, which are hardly mentioned in the report, play almost as important a role in the dissemination of misinformation online and are just as happy to profit from it. As the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, has warned, we are now being sold political ideas online with the same techniques that are used to sell shoes and holidays. And since the cost of buying into the wrong ideas is much less immediately apparent than the pain of ill-fitting or unfashionable shoes, the political sale is much more easily made.In her testimony to the committee, the information commissioner put her finger on one of the most important advantages that Facebook has over traditional advertising media. Not only does it know everything its users tell it about themselves it also compiles “shadow profiles”, which contain all the information that other users and data collectors have supplied about us. Internal emails obtained by the committee show that the company goes to great lengths to acquire such data from its advertisers. These are kept secret from their subjects. Ye Ms Denham argues that they are personal data and should be brought under the remit of existing privacy regulations. This is surely right.There is a paradox at the heart of the extraordinary effectiveness of Facebook and YouTube when it comes to the dissemination of ideas. Some people trust what they find there in part because they are so disillusioned with traditional authorities. The online channels, as television did before them, seem to offer an unprecedented intimacy to their users. A smartphone is the friend you take everywhere. But this apparent intimacy is in reality a place where people can be more professionally manipulated than ever before because the advertisers know so much more about us than they could before we entered it.Yet this concentration of power offers a paradoxical hope. When a few giant advertising companies control so much of the internet, pressure on them offers governments a means of indirect control over the consumer internet. Once Facebook was threatened with serious fines by the German government if it did not remove hate speech promptly, it discovered that this could after all be done: one in six Facebook moderators now work in Germany. Governments should never entirely control the internet but we need them there to protect society anyway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/036261aa955b6a91fc6795df49269909b2dc7154/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d0f9594cd3b77fbf9c508c52e7ea447","title":"they can deface marxs grave but theyll never erase his ideas","story":"The defacing of Karl Marx’s grave in Highgate cemetery is truly shocking. Red paint can be removed, but the hammer attack can’t be reversed. I love his grave because of the inscription: “The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways: the point is to change it.” That feels as alive and challenging as ever. Marx lived in London. His family is buried alongside him. We can argue all we like about his legacy, but this new act of vandalism is not an argument. It’s incoherent thuggery.Marx is often read these days, even by those who disagree with him, as a brilliant analyst of capitalism and even globalism. The idiots have written: “Architect of genocide.” Marx never held any political power. The graffiti also talks of Bolsheviks, although Marx was long dead before their rise. Members of his family would go on to be killed in the Holocaust. I guess whoever did this is protesting more about Stalin than Marx – and it is not the first time. Paint has been thrown at his grave before. In 1970, someone actually tried to bomb it. Someone also splashed paint on Churchill’s statue. These new “sites of struggle” are easy targets for cowards, I suppose.Yet these incoherent, fascist morons have sprayed “Ideology of Sterving” on part of Marx’s grave. Misspelt desecration sums up this act. You cannot vandalise an idea, but you can look stupid trying.So I hope to go and pay my respects very soon. I will also go to see my favourite grave in Highgate cemetery, that of the artist Patrick Caulfield. It’s a fabulous minimalist effort, with the letters DEAD carved out of the stone.Do go and see Marx’s grave when it is cleaned up, but don’t miss Caulfield’s either.

In essence, your identity is contained within your mobile device.3 Internet of things (IoT)We are now moving into the second generation of IoT, with sensors that can enable devices to make their own autonomous decisions and carry out processes that go beyond simple data gathering.It’s a technology that is already maturing in the domestic market, with applications such as webcams and remote lighting controls. With reliable networks and improved security, there will also be huge potential civic uses, too.4 Smart citiesSmart cities deploy communication and information technologies to improve services and the way the city is run, such as supporting public transport that can respond to varying demands and lighting systems that can be optimised to reduce energy bills.Mesh networks are set to take smart cities to the next level. They involve a collection of access points that talk to each other, making them more reliable, cheaper and able to take advantage of 5G, with download speeds and bandwidths hundreds of times greater than current ones.“These good connections, which are stable and can take massive data volumes, change the game completely,” says Brown. “All of a sudden, autonomous vehicles and drones become a reality.”5 The digital enterpriseThe idea of a digital enterprise is one where information has been digitised and technical barriers removed, allowing what Brown calls “the frictionless flow of data between departments”.This “machine-to-machine” interface not only speeds things up, but also encourages the sharing of ideas, greater cooperation and the destruction of workplace silos.6 BlockchainBlockchain technology provides a shared digital record of a transaction, securely logging where something has come from and where it’s going. Within a digital enterprise, it can be applied to back-end systems, reducing the threat of cyber risk as departments interact with each other.It can also provide a secure and verifiable audit trail of transactions between a department and citizens, without the need for paper or digging into databases.7 Cyber risk“The cyber risk landscape has changed,” says Brown. “In the old days, we used firewalls to put a fortress around a business or a department, but that no longer works if you’re going to have good collaboration, with departments and teams freely sharing information.”What’s required now, he explains, is the migration to a new way of thinking and the acceptance that not everything needs the same level of defence. So, instead of the fortress approach, “what you effectively have to do is put a defence around inidual data stores and devices”.8 Flexible workforceBrown advocates a “mobile first” policy that recognises that people do so much with their devices at home, yet, “when they get to work, the technology is 10 years out of date and they’re forced to use a paving slab of a laptop”.Instead, he believes, they should be able to choose to use their own device, something they’re familiar with and can help them be more productive. Some organisations are doing this, but many are yet to take this step.When he uses his own device for work, an app kicks in and splits his personal stuff from his work, he explains. “It ensures I conform to security policies and allows the company to wipe the business side of my device if they feel I’ve been compromised, but without touching my personal stuff.”This, he says, is not complex or expensive. The technology has been around for quite some time. “What’s slowed down its adoption is culture change.”9 Digital talentReplatforming and digitising more processes and data can dramatically change the skill set a department requires, with a significant shift in demand for people skilled in information integration, analytics and information governance.These digital skills are scarce and demand is high, so the public sector will need to start to think outside the box, looking to new ideas such as “bring your own team” and even posts on crowdsourcing sites, to find the talent they need.10 The rise of intelligent decision-making“It’s time to stop guessing and start measuring,” says Brown. “By harnessing dispersed data from across business processes, you can start to power data-driven decision-making.”By joining up these disparate pockets of data, organisations can get a much better overall view of performance, helping them to improve productivity and meet their own KPIs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cd00a43eef45ce122a3f95ed41204280aaa30fa/0_128_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea6b6a2a3c33e7570007fd42f7cad380","title":"london fashion week shafts of light to the heavy weight of history","story":"Contrasting shows from Roksanda and Erdem have immediate appealOrange is not traditionally worn with raspberry, nor caramel with tangerine, but they make perfect sense to designer Roksanda Ilinčić. “We live in a world of crazy contrast,” she said with a shrug backstage after her London fashion week show on Monday morning. “We all feel that, I think, and it creates a lot of anxiety.”Ilinčić, who begins each collection by sifting through her “precious box of colours – swatches of fabrics, images from books, postcards”, has a gift for finding beauty in the crazy contrasts. “I like putting together colours that are not supposed to go together,” she said.Burnt orange trousers teamed with a toffee taffeta tunic, finished with a coral pussy-bow flourish opened the show for her brand, Roksanda. A pumpkin trouser suit was matched with a fuchsia blouse. In between the jewel-box combinations came serenely beautiful palette cleansers in chic neutrals, like an oyster-grey soft wool boilersuit. The effect Ilinčić was aiming for was “a rainbow in a cloud”. She commissioned the London-based art trio Troika, whose Borrowed Light installation is on display at the BarbicanCentre, London, on a set where shafts of coloured light fell across a catwalk thickly carpeted with sand (or what appeared to be sand, but was actually salt) like sunset on a beach.Meanwhile at the National Portrait Gallery, Dame Joan Collins in the front row set the tone of old-school glamour for the Erdem show. On a trip to Rome, the designer Erdem Moralıoğlu visited the 1,000-room Palazzo Doria Pamphilj and became “obsessed” with the story of Princess Orietta Doria Pamphilj, who lived there until she died 19 years ago. A descendent of Pope Innocent X and heir to one of the world’s largest art collections, Orietta had been expected to become a nun but instead returned from a trip to London in the early 1960s with an adopted son.“What I liked about this story was the sense of the heavy weight of history, and how it plays out in this woman’s clothes. You can really feel this weight, in her home in Rome. There’s this moment when she has been in London at a time of huge social upheaval and returns to Rome, where she becomes obsessed with the idea of protecting her inheritance.” Photographs of her from this time show the influence of swinging London – shorter hemlines, piled-up beehives, feather trims – but “at the same time, she is sewing jewels into the lining of her coat, to carry them across borders”, said the designer backstage after his show, in between posing for photos with Collins.The backstory was a little heavy going, but the clothes were immediately appealing. The eccentric aristocrat is probably the oldest trope in fashion, but Erdem succeeded in making it fresh. There were grand-dame ball skirts and working-girl pencil skirts. Neat brooch-pinned cardigans were layered over beatnik black polo necks. Some models wore party-girl winged eyeliner, some black netted veils, and some both. Everyone wore fabulous earrings, and took the catwalk at a clip, in kitten heeled pumps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

Maurizio Sarri, isolated and alone, shuffled around his technical area as his team were outmuscled, outmanoeuvred and outclassed by Manchester United to depart the FA Cup with the kind of whimper that has become far too commonplace over recent weeks. The Italian’s eyes never left the pitch but he could not have escaped the full repertoire of chants, whipped up by the fans in the Matthew Harding stand – where faith in the current regime appears wrecked beyond repair – and which damned their own head coach. The humiliation was brutal.The chorus veered from “You don’t know what you’re doing” at the predictability of the substitutions, via an industrial and scathing assessment of Sarri-ball, a style this team have hardly ever mustered and clearly never mastered, to bellowed praise of Frank Lampard. Chelsea’s record goalscorer has other priorities at present, his focus on securing Derby’s elevation from the Championship, but his candidacy has arguably been enhanced by the startling success being enjoyed by Ole Gunnar Solksjær since he returned to Old Trafford in December. United stride on into a quarter-final at Wolverhampton. Sarri’s own future appears distinctly less certain.In the west stand Roman Abramovich’s box remained dark and empty, with the owner presumably oblivious to the cries of “You’re getting sacked in the morning” that were initiated in the away end but swiftly echoed around the arena’s four sides.The oligarch’s absence is adding to the sense this is a club that is rudderless at present. In the recent ruthless past he might already have acted. Perhaps after the embarrassing defeat at Bournemouth at the end of January or, more probably, the abject capitulation to Manchester City at the Etihad stadium.Victories over Huddersfield and Malmö secured only temporary respite. There is too much wrong with this setup, from the stubbornness of a coach unwilling to bend his philosophy, once considered a strength, to suit personnel to players whose confidence is shattered or whose commitment is questionable.John Terry was here watching and he must have winced at the sight of Chelsea wilting in the face of United’s pace, power and sheer aggression. David Luiz and Marcos Alonso squabbled through the aftermath of the first goal, while too many home players were left waving their arms in baffled submission as they digested the loss of the second.Admirable as Solskjær’s revived team were, that traumatic evening against Paris Saint-Germain apparently forgotten, the holders had made it easy for them, just as they have for far too many opponents of late.Sarri has the return leg with Malmö to come on Thursday, then the Carabao Cup final against City and a visit from Tottenham, all within the next eight days. The thought of that occasion at Wembley must fill him with dread, given how easily his players are pulled out of shape at present, although in view of the current mutinous mood he could yet be spared involvement.His assessment that Chelsea had been unlucky in the first half – “when we played better than the opponent” – was questionable. The spikiness had always been United’s, whether they were snapping into tackles – some illegal – to knock their hosts off their rhythm or niggling at Chelsea to leave them flustered.Even Chris Smalling summoned a shove, unnoticed by the officials, which sent Alonso careering into the advertising hoardings midway through the opening period, a sly nudge that rather summed up their resolve.United were never likely to wilt but they knew Chelsea could be knocked off their stride. The victory was established by the interval. Theirs had been the aggression, the energy and the quality to bully fragile players into submission.Perhaps the hosts may have settled had Gonzalo Higuaín guided a free header on target or Sergio Romero not thwarted David Luiz’s free-kick and Pedro’s follow-up. Instead the home side were breached and all the insecurities exposed at the Etihad and Vitality stadiums reared again.Juan Mata’s clever shuffling of possession through midfield had helped conjure their opener, freeing the outstanding Paul Pogba from the mess of bodies down the flank. He teased space from Antonio Rüdiger before sending in a glorious cross to the far post where Ander Herrera was free to nod back across Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the far corner.At first glance it seemed inconceivable that the diminutive Spaniard had been permitted to leap and score by Alonso, the fall-guy of the moment. Yet Chelsea’s entire midfield had been attracted to Mata’s promptings with Mateo Kovacic, who might otherwise have tracked the Spaniard’s run in the buildup, leaving the whole formation lopsided.César Azpilicueta, too, had been caught upfield and was still ambling back as the net bulged, with the on-field captain looking increasingly exhausted by his regular toils.As half-time approached, Chelsea surrendered the ball yet again just inside their own territory for Pogba to slide Marcus Rashford into space down the right. A panicked David Luiz dangled a leg at the England forward, whose cross was duly met emphatically by Pogba, ing between Rüdiger and Azpilicueta in the centre, to double the lead via the goalkeeper’s right glove.Everything his team managed thereafter was confused, according to Sarri, in forlorn pursuit of parity as the mood became increasingly poisonous and his decision to throw on Davide Zappacosta rather than Callum Hudson-Odoi, for whom the clamour had been deafening, felt like two fingers being stuck up at the crowd. With that relationship fractured, time is running out for the Italian."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c567f553aead67ee5126a761ead3d5fd7d595cad/0_237_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69a8d73ab74fa349eab2f7e328c34501","title":"fa cup quarter final draw","story":"The Manchester clubs were kept apart in the draw for the FA Cup quarter-finals, made shortly after United’s 2-0 defeat of Chelsea.

While greater first-team opportunity is viewed as the principal reason for leaving the Premier League for the Bundesliga, with Sancho, Keanan Bennetts and Reiss Nelson among those to depart in recent seasons, Klopp believes the transfer policies of English clubs is another factor.Liverpool, the manager admitted, wanted to sign Sancho but their rivalry with City rendered the deal a non-starter. Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United were also keen on the England forward before, having declined a professional contract at the Etihad Stadium, he joined Dortmund for an initial fee of £8m in August 2017.Asked about the recent trend of German clubs signing young English players, the former Dortmund manager replied: “Buying English players is a smart idea because we would never have a chance to get Sancho. We are not blind – we saw him, we liked him and then we think: ‘Can we get him?’ No. Because English clubs don’t sell to other English clubs. I don’t know exactly what the reason is for that but they don’t do it. Now they can go to Germany, which is a wonderful league.”Michael Zorc, Dortmund’s technical director, said recently that the quality of young players was higher in England than Germany at present. Klopp concurs, although he does not believe the Bundesliga has a lasting problem. “There is no dip,” he added. “Six or seven years ago you had all these boys coming up – Marco Reus, André Schürrle, Mario Götze, Thomas Müller, Mats Hummels – and it was clear when they became Under‑21 European champions it would be a generation of proper quality. It is clear that England now has that situation. It is like a wave with one country a little bit up and another country down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f684ff574dde6f4ff3e6955f30c466af5277188/494_147_1613_968/master/1613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c728cede5a76f8568b325af5f251dd0","title":"arsene wenger mesut ozil comfort zone arsenal","story":"Arsène Wenger believes the decision to offer Mesut Özil a long-term contract last year may have left the German in a “comfort zone”.Özil ended speculation about his future last year by committing himself to Arsenal until the summer of 2021, with Wenger still at the helm. But the playmaker has fallen out of favour under Wenger’s successor, Unai Emery, having started only one game since Boxing Day to bring renewed scrutiny as to whether he will remain at the Emirates Stadium.Wenger, speaking after being honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Laureus World Sports Awards, said: “I feel that the length of the contract has nothing to do normally with the selection of the team. But sometimes there are special cases. Most of the time now we think when we sign a player for five years we have a good player for five years. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that they practise, they play their best. Because they might be in their comfort zone.“He has a contract but the problem is that, if you want to buy a player like him, you have to spend £100m. And to maintain the value of the player, beyond the Özil case, it is more about the way football is structured.“To buy players of top, top quality you need £100m. So the decision you have to make is whether you re-sign the player, who costs us nothing, or do we have the money to buy a new player?”Simone Biles’ four gold medals at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships saw her overcome Simona Halep, Angelique Kerber, Ester Ledecka, Mikaela Shiffrin and Daniela Ryf to be named sportswoman of the year at the awards show.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsNovak Djokovic collected his fourth sportsman of the year honour in recognition of returning to No 1 in the tennis rankings.

Now, we’re being told to declutter our homes and diaries. What happened to just being ourselves?What brings you joy? It is a question that is hard to avoid these days, as joy seems to be the new buzzword. It is on the cover of two new books, The Joy of No (#Jono) by Debbie Chapman, published at the end of last year, and The Joy of Missing Out, by the philosopher and psychologist Svend Brinkmann, published earlier this month. It is also on Netflix, in the show Tidying Up with Marie Kondo, in which the decluttering guru and author tells us to discard any possessions that do not “spark joy”. Truly, a surfeit of joy!But joy is not the only idea linking these three approaches: Chapman, Brinkmann and Kondo all tap into the same zeitgeisty wish to clean up our cluttered lives. For Kondo, it is about household clutter for Chapman and Brinkmann, it is life clutter.For Chapman, life clutter builds up when we fill our lives with social events we do not really want to go to, work tasks we say yes to, when they are not our responsibility, toxic relationships and unhelpful thoughts and feelings. Just as Kondo promises to bring us joy by decluttering our homes, these books promote decluttering of a different kind – social, professional, psychological, existential – that, the authors tell us, will lead us to true fulfilment and freedom.It is no surprise to me that this is the focus of the current wave of “how can I fix my life” angst. The wish to say no instead of saying yes, to stay in instead of going out, to discard instead of to accumulate – these are all logical responses to our feelings of being overstretched, overtired and overwhelmed. Clinical psychologist Rachel Andrew says she sees this in many forms in her consulting room, with patients saying life is too stressful and too pressured, or describing themselves as detached and their lives as meaningless and unsustainable.Her patients tell her, she says, that “they cannot continue living at the pace they’re living at”, but at the same time, they cannot stop – they cannot say no. When she hears these words, Andrew begins thinking about “the core beliefs underneath people’s inability to say no”. When patients describe struggling to refuse to take on extra responsibilities at work, she says there is often an underlying fear that others will think they are not trying hard enough, an underlying fear that they are not good enough. That compulsive “yes” also forms part of a precarious solution to their self-doubt, she says, as, unconsciously: “They use this constant striving to make themselves feel better, to get that buzz from achieving things.”When patients struggle to say no to social arrangements, she says: “Sometimes that can come from a core belief of feeling, deep down, that they’re unlikable.” The roots of these beliefs are frequently buried in our past. “I often meet adults who had difficult experiences in childhood, where they felt on the outside of a social group or experienced a trauma, and they don’t want to say no due to a fear of being on the outside, that people will discover them as unlikable in some way. That can lead to this perpetual need to say yes or to keep others happy.”Maurice Mcleod, a writer and local councillor, found that his inability to say “no” caused him serious problems when he went freelance about a decade ago. He took on so many projects and agreed to do so many favours that, he says, he was living with “a constant feeling of unease and panic. Every time the phone rang, I’d think: ‘Oh my God, who’s that, what haven’t I done?’ It was this constant feeling of letting people down.” He took on so much unpaid work that he had to refuse work that was paid, got into debt, and realised the only way out was to just say “no”.He developed a series of questions in his mind to help him work out which requests to refuse, and which to accept: will it pay? How long will it take? How much attention will it require? This helped him to feel calmer and less panicked. He says, despite “the moments of awkwardness saying no – and it is still awkward – in my head, I know the benefit of not having that extra deadline looming”.But that is not to say it was simple, he cautions. “I still find it very difficult. I still get flattered when someone says they’d like me to be involved in their project, and I still find myself saying yes to things that I really shouldn’t. I’m not pretending I’ve conquered saying ‘no’.”It seems it is more complicated to experience “#Jono” than Harding suggests in her book, which is full of sentences such as: “Ditch the guilt.” Reader, at this my laughter was bitter and hollow.This is the problem with the hashtagification of this notion of saying no, of doing less, of reacting against what the psychoanalyst and fellow of the Institute of Psychoanalysis Josh Cohen calls our “manically overactive, hyper-stimulated acquisitive culture”. His book Not Working: Why We Have to Stop, is a critique of our state of perpetual busyness, a hymn in praise of doing nothing. But, he says, while he has added his voice to a “chorus of disapproval” of this culture, he has, at the same time, “a certain suspicion” of what is being created in its place. He says: “I think that once a tendency or a counter-tendency starts to trend in this way, it becomes part of the culture it wants to critique or resist. It enters the circuit of anxiety.” Inevitably, then, we begin asking ourselves, are we saying no enough? Are we missing out enough? Are we not working enough? As we strive to embrace the virtues of restraint, of doing less, of leaving space, we risk destroying that which we seek. It evaporates even as we try to articulate it, like the credibility of people who tweet about how much they are “living in the moment”.But this is nevertheless something we need to grapple with. For Brinkmann, it is not only a question of our psychological wellbeing – although it is that too. He writes that self-restraint and missing out are as vital for the global population as they are for us as iniduals because “for so long our lives have been based on overconsumption, untrammelled growth and whittling away at our natural resources”. His arguments are compelling.Imagine that you have cancelled all your unwanted plans, said no to all your groan-inducing invitations, resisted tempting purchases, turned off your TVs, phones and computers. You are missing out on absolutely everything and feeling very smug about it, too. You are, in this moment, sitting at home, on your own, doing nothing. What happens next?“All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone,” said the 17th-century French philosopher Blaise Pascal. But the solution cannot be to force ourselves to sit quietly in a room alone, because, contrary to our own omnipotent fantasies and risible delusions of self-control, we cannot choose what we feel or what we think. We have to ask, why is this such an impossible thing for us to do? Why do we persist in filling our lives, even when we do not want to? What is it that we are avoiding? Ultimately, why do we continue to do the very things that make us unhappy?Such big questions can be addressed by psychoanalysis, says Cohen, since, “uniquely to itself, it encourages us to ask questions about how we live that we are allowed to sit with, and turn over, and not feel under pressure to resolve. It asks us to be with the question rather than leap to the answer.” He also suggests taking a long walk with no destination in mind, or meeting a friend without a time limit or agenda – in other words, trying to create an expanse in your life that is not hemmed in by time, space, or purpose. “It’s all about cultivating in oneself the impulse to aimlessness,” he says.As for #Jono and #Jomo – well, for me, saying no and missing out are not where I find my joy. I find it when I am not looking for it: when I am making my friend’s children laugh, or when I feel a spontaneous surge of love for my husband, or when I am cooking dinner for my friends. Cohen says: “If you read the great poets of joy, like Rilke, they think of joy as something fleeting. There is something sad about it, because one feels its passing as one experiences it – it is not some kind of permanent aspiration, a solid state.” It is a word that loses all meaning when it is part of a hashtagged acronym.In these dysfunctional times, joy is a high bar. Perhaps we could start with trying to be honest with ourselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dbae4a5383cd0c559da3df79894b0e2a97e1fca/0_0_3060_1837/master/3060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33325315086de2aa7f23accb90b43af0","title":"tell us how did you meet your partner","story":"As part of a new series exploring romantic relationships we are looking to hear your storiesDo you have an interesting story about how you met your partner?

Taking three menus, our wine expert offers tips for happy drinking that won’t break the bankThere are a handful of obvious questions anyone should be asking when presented with a wine list. But unless – like Cristiano Ronaldo during his recent visit to glitzy Mayfair seafood restaurant Scott’s – you’re untroubled by the prospect of shelling out £18,000 for a bottle of Richebourg Grand Cru, the most pressing will always be: “How much do I want to spend here?”Being clear – and firm – about your budget will curb any urge on the part of your sommelier to – in the industry lingo – “upsell” you something you can’t afford. And, contrary to stubborn popular belief, if that budget only stretches as far as the house wine (or that ever-popular “second-cheapest wine on the list”) that needn’t mean you’re in for a night of bad plonk and disdain. Whether it’s part of a pizza chain or Michelin-starred, any decent restaurant will know that the house wines are their most important bottles, the ones by which customers will judge them. Consequently, they put a lot of effort into getting them right, and are proud of them.If, though, you’re splashing out, always beware the vintage. The majority of the world’s most expensive wines have earned their reputations at least in part through their ability to age there’s little point shelling out a fortune on a wine so young (less than a decade old in the case of the top reds of Bordeaux, Burgundy or Barolo) that it has yet to show off the qualities that will one day make it truly special.Equally, there’s no point wasting money on a gorgeously subtle wine if you’re going to swamp it with chilli, sugar, vinegar or other wine-troubling ingredients such as artichokes. A good sommelier will help you avoid that kind of clash, with the by-the-glass list (massively improved in quality, range and value in most restaurants in recent years) often the source of the most creative – and economic – solutions.But if you’re in a sommelier-free zone and on your own with the list, it’s worth remembering that some wines are more versatile than others. Lighter, fresh reds (such as beaujolais or Loire cabernet franc), richer whites (such as Rhône-style blends, whether from southern France or South Africa) and fino sherry are, in my experience, among the wines best placed to match a table of different dishes and people – without, of course, breaking the bank.Main: Pheasant, leek and truffle pieDessert: British cheeses, crab apple and oatcakesThe impeccably sourced ingredients, understated cheffy skill and carefully cultivated informality of ambience that characterise the hipper restaurants of London, Edinburgh and Manchester are perfect matches for certain kinds of modern wine.Made by people who are either believers in, or sympathetic to, the back-to-basics, back-to-the-land philosophy of the natural wine scene, these are wines that put a premium on drinkability and food compatibility: qualities not always apparent in the kind of glossy, showy, super-ripe, super-oaky tipples that once dominated the vinous mainstream.Go by the glass or pitcher, and ask your sommelier to recommend a pétillant naturel (pét-nat) sparkler from the Loire as an aperitif an orange wine from Friuli in north-east Italy or from Georgia to pair with the crab, celeriac and almond and a natural cinsault from the Languedoc or South Africa to go with the pheasant, leek and truffle pie. To finish: see what kind of age-dated sherry, madeira or marsala they’ve got to match those British cheeses.Starter: Houmous with peri-peri drizzleMain: Chicken wings in peri-peri sauceThe essence of restaurants such as Nando’s is basically twofold: chicken and spicy peri-peri sauce of various degrees of heat. And it’s the second of those two elements that would be most influential in informing what to drink in this case.Chilli heat works well with wines containing a little sugar – it’s the same principle that goes into the mixing of palm or coconut sugar with chilli in Thai and other south-east Asian cuisines. Not too much sugar: we’re not talking sticky dessert wines, which, with as much as 200g per litre, would be overwhelming. And not too light: the filigree off-dry riesling whites found in Germany’s Mosel region would be blown away by the umami and fatty richness of the chicken.I’m thinking more of the fuller-bodied kind of off-dry white styles found in Alsace, or Alsace-inspired wines made using the same grape varieties, such as pinot gris and gewürztraminer, in New Zealand, Chile, California and elsewhere.And not just in Nando’s. These are wines that work well anywhere that spice is in the mix: from your local Thai or curry house, to Peruvian, Korean and Szechuan Chinese.Starter: Coquille St Jacques in the shell with prawnsMain: Rack of lamb with herbs served with mint sauce, redcurrant jellyAccording to an age-old and generally reliable piece of wine-and-food-matching advice: what grows together, goes together. All of which would suggest that classic French restaurants demand classic French wines. Indeed, in most such places that will be pretty much all you’re offered.Given that, among others, pinot noir from coastal California, Oregon and New Zealand can be just as refined as that from Burgundy and given that you can find cabernet and merlot-based wines in Napa, the Tuscan coast and South America that live up to the best of Bordeaux, it’s worth asking if the sommelier has any international surprises (which may well be competitively priced) up their sleeves.If it has to be French, you could ask whether they have a good-quality, aged muscadet in lieu of more expensive chablis for the coquilles St Jacques, and you may find that a spicy Languedoc red will be the most economically delicious – and traditional – pairing for a rack of lamb.And to partner the raspberry millefeuille, ask for the by-the-glass list and see if they have such great value sweet wines as montbazillac or jurançon from France’s often-overlooked south-west."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/080884947fed9fdb2fe1f1193a2c29c07c7577e6/0_0_4155_2493/master/4155.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e83dd735dfac7f3c12dc5255337cbd0","title":"bbc radio 4 today show should be less london centric says alastair campbell","story":"Labour party grandee says the BBC programme should cover arts and sport as serious issuesBBC Radio 4’s Today programme should be less upper-middle class and less London-centric, Labour party grandee Alastair Campbell has said, urging the BBC to use the departure of longtime host John Humphrys as an opportunity to reform itself.The agenda-setting radio show lost 800,000 listeners last year and came under criticism for not adequately representing a broad spectrum of interests across the nation, often featuring middle-class guests.“Think younger, when planning subjects and interviewees,” Campbell recommended in an interview with the Radio Times. “Think less upper-middle-aged, upper-middle class. Think less London. Think less political process and more policy. Think less ‘gotcha’ entertainment and more education and enlightenment.”Detractors regularly claim the BBC and its programmes only amplify the pages of newspapers. Campbell said Today should produce more original content and reflect what the papers say less. “Not just in the review of said papers but in the setting of the news and interview agenda too.”Sarah Sands, the former Evening Standard editor, became Today editor in 2017, and criticism soon followed, with many saying there were too many “soft” interviews on the programme and not enough hard reporting.“Gone was the questioning, argumentative tone that characterises most current affairs output, let alone the harrumphing cynicism that has come to be Humphrys’s stock-in-trade,” Campbell said.“This was peak reverence for a ‘much-loved institution’. We had giggly, flirty interviews as rival presenters from rival shows sought out the great man and he pretended to be grumpy. Hard news this was not.”However, he paid tribute to Humphrys for outstaying former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre, Manchester United legend Alex Ferguson and the recently departed Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger by some distance.But, Campbell added, “not unlike Wenger”, Humphrys had failed to evolve with the times, criticising the veteran broadcaster for “opinionated snorting sarcasm” and giving hard Brexit advocates such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, Iain Duncan Smith and David Davis “a chummier ride” than other guests.He also recommended that the programme should start to cover arts, culture and sport as serious issues rather than using the topics as “fluffy fillers between the hard stuff”.“Think about moving or getting rid of some of the furniture. If you must persist with Thought for the Day, make it more interesting, more varied, younger, less London,” Campbell said.Though he noted his turbulent relationship with the Today programme meant he was “the last person they would listen to”, with his infamous interview with Andrew Gilligan on the show leading to the Hutton inquiry and Humphrys accusing Tony Blair’s former spokesperson of attempting to “derail the BBC”, Campbell made some suggestions for who should replace Humphrys.“Think Emma Barnett or Shelagh Fogarty or Victoria Derbyshire. Not yet trapped inside the BBCWestminster bubble. Northerners all. Quizzical not cynical.

Songs such as Lullaby, Lovesong, Pictures of You and Fascination Street cemented the band’s success in the United States too. By 1992, the album, described by this publication as “exquisitely morose”, had sold more than three million copies worldwide.The Cure will be playing the record with a full band, featuring lead singer Robert Smith alongside Simon Gallup, Jason Cooper, Roger O’Donnell and Reeves Gabrels.This will be the second time the Cure have played Vivid Live after 2011’s Reflections shows, at which the band played their first three albums in full: Three Imaginary Boys, Seventeen Seconds and Faith.This time, the band will play Disintegration along with other tracks from their back catalogue.Announcing the 2019 shows, Smith said: “Our Reflections shows in 2011 were truly memorable experiences, and with the excitement surrounding those early album performances in mind we are more than delighted to be announcing our return.”While the band has a series of festival dates scheduled across the globe through the year, the Disintegration shows in Sydney are being billed as a “world premiere” – but no other venues or dates have been announced.The idea for the shows came about after Vivid Live curator Ben Marshall contacted Smith directly asking for footage from the 2011 tour. While chatting, Marshall said he asked if Smith would consider performing Disintegration in its 30th year. Smith said he would love to.Marshall described Disintegration as an “immaculately glacial, majestic album marrying raw, intense emotion with some of the biggest hits of their career”. He added that the Cure’s choice of venue for their tour’s debut was “both a perfect fit and an immense honour”.Tickets to the four shows will be available via a ballot system, which is now open for applications. The Opera House says the system will “ensure everyone has an equal chance” at tickets while minimising website congestion.

Smith’s comment, however, was not addressed by the host Jo Coburn.Sarkar later tweeted: “So err, Angela Smith went a bit of a ‘funny tinge’ herself when I started asking about her record on water privatisation.”Angela Smith was soon trending on Twitter, and was criticised for her remark.Labour MP Rupa Huq said: “They claim their new party is anti-racist and modern yet in the same breath describe black, Asian and minority ethnic people as having a ‘funny tinge’. This is, at best, the casual racism of the 1970s that I thought we’d long left behind. But it will strike many as an appalling, racist comment. Is the Independent Group going to investigate?”The journalist Jane Merrick tweeted: “Really shocking to hear the Angela Smith ‘funny tinge’ comments – how does that phrase even cross your mind when referring to racism? But those involved in the Independent Group should denounce what she’s said.”Smith apologised several hours later. “I have seen the clip from Politics Live, I am very sorry about any offence caused and I am very upset that I misspoke so badly,” she said in a clip posted on Twitter.“It’s not what I am, I am committed to fighting racism wherever I find it in our society.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/914030fb618b9287be093a5c0d752515bff29a75/597_605_3270_1962/master/3270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=293b3cab2f77218e1bb0c3ab84bf45ef","title":"labour mps split a clear attempt to start a new party","story":"Hope and fury contrast as MPs begin long journey to influenceIt has no name, no logo, no staff and no money. Yet those who packed into the tiny room above Westminster Bridge as seven MPs announced they were quitting the Labour party were left in no doubt that this was the beginning of a new political party.“The crucial word is yet,” one of the MPs said afterwards. “We are not a new party – yet.”As of Monday, the group are independents with no special status in the House of Commons. They hope to be something much more concrete, depending on their success in persuading other MPs to join them.In the short term the group has one central task – to convince 29 more disgruntled MPs from any party colour to join their group. That would give them official third party status – overtaking the SNP and access not just to more “Short money” but also a prized guaranteed slot for the group’s leader at every PMQs, replacing the SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford.Those MPs involved in the new group’s organisation stress that they hope this week will be dominated by several news cycles’ worth of new developments, including an expectation of more defections. If they do not materialise, the group will find it hard to maintain momentum.Two names mentioned as the most likely Conservative targets are the Tory MPs Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston, both independent-minded and supporters of the People’s Vote campaign.The most crucial name on the list of seven is Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree who has faced a slew of antisemitic abuse including death threats that have seen more than one abuser put behind bars.Berger, who is nine months pregnant, had not often been talked about in the same breath as MPs like Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie who have been on the brink of quitting for many months over the party’s Brexit policy. Yet it was she who strode into the room first and chaired the event, looking the most like the group’s leader.The group will meet later this week to decide how to structure their group – which could involve a process for selecting a leader. Much of the future will depend how many more MPs join them.Labour MPs have been grappling with how to respond – particularly with the departure of Berger over antisemitism. One MP close to Berger suggested last week that they would find it hard not to follow her out the door.“If we have said time and again we have standing in solidarity with her over antisemitism, what does it count for if she leaves and we stay?” the MP said.Another senior Labour MP said there were several more MPs on the brink of resigning – and that 12 had originally been committed to joining the group. He said Corbyn’s reaction had basically been “a declaration of war rather than conciliatory, with no acknowledgement at all that there is a problem in the culture of the Labour party”.For now, the Labour leadership is not outwardly concerned by the resignations. Those close to Corbyn feel that the MPs quitting are hardly household names – unlike the former cabinet ministers who left to join the SDP in 1981.There is also scepticism that the policy positioning of those leaving the party will appeal to an electorate that they believe has rejected “centrist, Blairite” values.Multiple MPs said their response would be governed by Corbyn’s own reaction, including his response to deselection attempts and attacks on social media. A hardline response would prompt more to depart, many MPs said.Yet others are cautious about the effect of more resignations on the success of the People’s Vote campaign – mostly because the “People’s Vote” campaign would become closely associated with a group opposed to Labour.Pro-EU MPs are concerned at the loss of their colleagues for the organisation of the anti-Brexit movement pushing for a second referendum in Labour. The internal party WhatsApp groups have already been reorganised, cutting out Leslie, Umunna and the others who have been instrumental in shaping pro-EU arguments and parliamentary tactics.The official People’s Vote campaign moved at lightning speed to distance themselves from the new movement – despite being associated with all of its MPs. One of the MPs involved said they had not discussed their departures in official People’s Vote campaign meetings, for fear of hostile leaking.Privately, some organisers are furious and say that the splitters could irreparably damage their relationship with left-wing groups and the Labour leadership.Questions are also likely to be asked about other Labour MPs currently sitting as independents, as well as fierce Corbynsceptics who are deeply opposed to a second referendum.MPs at the launch dodged the prospect of others like John Woodcock and Ivan Lewis joining the grouping – both Corbyn critics who quit the party after being suspended over sexual harassment allegations.Frank Field, who also quit the party in disgust at antisemitism allegations and a no confidence vote by his constituents, is a determined Brexiter who has backed the government’s exit deal.At the moment, all members of the new grouping are supporters of a second referendum. Yet sources suggested this would not necessarily be a prerequisite forever. Members of the group would hardly admit it in public, but there may come a point in the next few months when it becomes apparent that that campaign has failed and the group’s aims for the next phase of Brexit become more flexible.MPs in the group are adamant they have no link to other efforts to create a new movement in the centre ground, such as the former Labour leader Tony Blair, or one under construction by some ex-Blair advisers including his former speechwriter Jonathan Powell. “If you’re going to build a new politics it’s got to be the people who are currently on the field,” one of the MPs said. “This has to be a project for current politicians and activists and people who want to build a new politics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e752c4cba36bff6c3efe82cfd10f2bdf275d5712/14_0_3471_2083/master/3471.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90304f6d0ed19d10bc23b565d00cd036","title":"now wasnt the time readers on the labour mps split","story":"You have been reacting to seven Labour MPs leaving the party and discussing what might be next for BrexitIt’s not 1981 and these MPs aren’t the gang of four. I suspect this will prove to be a bad miscalculation by Umunna et al. The ‘future of British politics’ will be one without them - which is a shame because I’d much prefer we united all of our efforts into getting rid of the vile government. Mike BarkerThe only thing that would be useful - to the country, if not the leadership of the two main parties - about Umunna et al going would be that they take a few Tories with them, and thus remove May’s majority. Theoretically at least, this could really change the direction of British politics and force a second referendum, or the abandonment of no-deal or of Brexit altogether. But if they can’t do that, this is just a waste of time and column inches. And I can’t help wondering exactly what it is that Chris Leslie sees in the company he’s keeping ... unless it can tempt away half a dozen Tories to go with them. wightpaintFinally! A centrist party that remain voters can get behind! So sick of Tory and Labour spearheading Brexit meaning no effective opposition. Let’s get real proportional representation and sort this country out in coalitions representing this ided country’s views - the only way we’re going forward together as a country is in compromise and the two-party system prevents this. Tallisker2Pretty damning. These seven will get a lot of stick rightfully so I believe, but still pretty damning for Corbyn and most sickening of all, the Tories will get a pass on the Brexit mess because of disunity like this. Not sure how these seven don’t see that, or maybe they don’t care? There probably is space for a new centrist party, but we’re facing the biggest issue in generations which needs addressing. Now wasn’t the time for this, and for timing alone these seven should be case into the wilderness of British Politics for ever. Rob BrackstoneThe “New” Labour people have no real perspective on how history will view their actions. The timing of the 172 MPs who voted to out Corbyn just after the referendum and probably cost Labour the 2017 GE and now, it looks like they are jumping ship just when we need as much effort as possible behind a people’s vote. TynebobI don’t even support Labour but this is a sorry state of affairs. Breaking away from the party offers no strategic gain. It doesn’t make remain any more likely, if anything it diminishes it. Reform only happens from within - wasn’t that the central argument of remainers in the first place? AmouxThe comparisons with the gang of four of 1981 are wrong. Yes both are a splintering caused by a hard left turn in the Labour Party. Yes, the Labour party is currently unelectable like in 1981. The more so because its handling of Brexit will lose it millions of younger votes including e.g. the seat of Canterbury.Most obviously though 2019 is different because there was in 1981 no defining political cause of the day on which to gain political energy. Brexit affords that to this new group and allows them to rehome potentially millions of voters (which the Lib Dems have singularly failed to do under an ailing leadership). Campaigning for a second vote will drive energy and electoral power to this new group, which is the calculation they have made on timing - now and not in six weeks.The second point is the age of these MPs. This is a newish generation of MPs (but with credibility from some experience). The gang of four were all past their political peak - and career trajectory matters in politics. Political change against the populists like May and Corbyn is coming from the new generation, ground up - May and Corbyn are either side of 70 and don’t recognise the need for inter-generational change. Neither are radical practical thinkers and are both in different ways intolerant of change. Any reform agenda they have is going nowhere right now - since they have both have been hobbled by their extremist wings.In this Brexit mess the political change happening now under our feet is as radical as the social change of the 1960’s, and the centrist MP’s see that. They do have a good chance. sussexplanThe Labour Party hasn’t changed since the last General Election when these MPs stood under the Labour banner. It is they who have deserted the Labour voters. They should resign as MPs and fight by-elections as Independents, but they won’t because basically they are gutless. DADAspeakThe left of the party withstood all kinds of pressure to leave throughout the 90s and beyond. Most of us stayed if we weren’t kicked out. These saps have no fortitude. I’ve been a member of the party for 22 years and have never voted any other way. There is exactly the same amount of antisemitism as there has always been in Labour, not very much. As for the hard left machine politics stuff, there was nothing more machine like than the Blair years. And if they think a broadly Wilsonian stance is hard left then maybe they are in the wrong party. Well, Good luck to them. At least they’ll have a job till the next election. But if they let a Tory in may the dead of their constituencies rise up and eat them. DrWhatsonThis is sad, very sad. Labour is supposed to be a broad church, MPs getting hounded out is not a sign of a government in waiting. And the rebels are right on antisemitism, the response from the leadership was too slow and inadequate. One gets the impression Corbyn preferred to soft-peddle when criticising old comrades. That said, this was always going to happen with Brexit. We will see a similar split with the Tories, it’s only a matter of time. Finite187Pity about the number of cynics on here. Surely this is just a symptom of how polarised politics has become and a result of loss of faith in weak leadership, that reasonable people are trying to find moderate ground. I’m all for centrism personally. You can sneer all you like of course but I don’t see much inspiration coming from elsewhere. 89798840The Tories will be loving this and what awful timing. You have to ask: ‘Why now?’. Well they should stand for re-election immediately then, but doubt they’ll do so. They would rather keep the Tories in than see a real, socialist Labour party.

While tariffs are less of an issue for the sector, as most finished aerospace parts are not caught by the levies, import VAT and tariffs on generic parts and raw materials could still add significant costs.That scenario also includes customs checks taking only 70 seconds per vehicle, which the Department for Transport estimates could cause six-day delays at the border.“When you’re selling an aircraft you can’t have any parts missing,” the chief economist at ADS, Jeegar Kakkad, said. “One part stops the whole process.”The output of British aerospace manufacturers fell for the first time in four years in 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics, with concerns around global growth as well as Brexit clouding the outlook.Airbus, one of the UK’s largest aerospace employers at its wing factory and design centre, has warned that a no-deal Brexit could cost it €1bn (£875m) per week, while indicating that it could leave the UK altogether in the event of a disorderly departure. Kakkad added that smaller suppliers are likely to be more vulnerable to problems with cashflow.The aerospace and defence sectors together employed more than 260,000 people in Britain in 2017, according to ADS figures but future expansion by non-British companies could be threatened if new frictions are introduced in the trade between the UK and the EU.Kakkad said: “The issue isn’t about what we have now it’s if we look halfway through the next decade when decisions are being made on the next set of wings the next supply chain.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b600358e5a65d0e7abf2e05cc45ac2e36938024c/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=724aef4220ab13601988ebdb1f7b77b9","title":"splitting headache what the papers say about labour partys turmoil","story":"Front pages are full of dire warnings for Jeremy Corbyn after day of dramaThe front pages are full of dire warnings for Labour after a day of drama that saw seven MPs quit the party over its stance on antisemitism and Brexit to form the Independent Group.Most papers lead with Labour deputy leader Tom Watson’s warning to Jeremy Corbyn that more resignations will follow if he doesn’t bring change to the party. leads on: “Corbyn is warned: change or more rebels will quit”.The Times has a similar take: “More resignations will follow, Corbyn is warned”, as does the Daily : “Corbyn warned more will quit as ‘Gang of Seven’ split Labour”.Headline of the day goes to the Mirror, which puts it simply: “Splitting headache”.The i focuses on the Labour leader’s reaction to the exodus: “Corbyn on red alert for new defectors”.The Mail has a photograph of Corbyn on his way to his allotment, with the pun “Leader who’s lost the plot”.The drama also made it to the front of the Scotsman, which borrowed a line from the Independent Group’s presser: “Politics is broken”.“MP’s despair at Corbyn stance” is the picture story on the front of the Financial Times, which leads on the Honda plant closure.The Express and the Sun go their own way to splash on Bethnal Green schoolgirl Shamima Begum’s comments on the Manchester Arena bombing.

World athletics’ governing body responded with a press release that restated its case and listed five of the experts it intends to call at CAS. An hour later, Semenya’s lawyers issued a statement that strongly criticised the move and questioned the IAAF’s motives. They said: “Ms Semenya believes the IAAF press release is a clear breach of the confidentiality provisions that was orchestrated in an effort to influence public opinion.” Semenya’s lawyers added they have raised this issue with Cas and, “as a matter of fairness”, they will be revealing the names of their experts supporting their case on Tuesday .A spokesperson for the IAAF said: “The IAAF does not believe the list of witnesses it will be calling is confidential, just their evidence at Cas. Cas left the decision for all parties to release their witness list to the parties involved. This was agreed.”The IAAF said it was acting because it wants to “empower girls and women” by maintaining a level playing field. “The female category in sport is a protected category,” it said.“For it to serve its purposes, which include providing females opportunities equal to males, it must have eligibility standards that ensure athletes who identify as female but have testes, and testosterone levels in the male range, at least drop their testosterone levels into the female range in order to compete at the elite level in the female classification.“This standard is necessary to ensure fair competition for all women. Indeed, without it, we risk losing the next generation of female athletes, since they will see no path to success in our sport.”The IAAF named three leading professors of endocrinology, a sports law expert and a transgender medical physicist as being among the experts it will call on this week.The IAAF is adamant it has evidence to support its testosterone limit and is intending to introduce the rule on 26 March, six months later than planned to allow for Semenya’s challenge. If the rule survives Semenya’s challenge, athletes wishing to compete in the relevant events will need to reduce their testosterone levels to five nanomoles per litre (nmolL) for at least six months before racing.Cas has promised to make a ruling on the matter within a month.

Those who say rugby is short on characters have clearly not met Ellis Genge, the Leicester loosehead prop, whose taste in inspirational body art is putting the boot into Six Nations convention.To mark significant English Tests and overseas tours, the 23-year‑old likes to have a reminder of the experience inked on his right foot. Despite having only six caps, he already has a wide array of designs including wallabies, a springbok, a puma and a shamrock to denote successful recent England performances against Australia, South Africa, Argentina and Ireland, among others.Genge, yet to taste defeat in an England jersey, is likely to be involved in Cardiff on Saturday along with Exeter’s Ben Moon as Eddie Jones seeks to fill the gap left by the injured Mako Vunipola.Should he feature, the Bristolian says a fiery dragon will be added to his tattoo collection. “I have got all my Test matches on my foot,” he said. “If I play, I’ll get a dragon. I didn’t really want to get tattoos on my arms so I just got one on my foot and it kept going from there.”Given he could have a lengthy Test career and rugby-themed tattoos on his left foot are off limits – “that’s for leisure” – he may soon have to start decorating another body part.When the dragon materialises, however, it will not displease everyone around him. “I have got a Welsh missus, so I don’t mind the Welsh. They are a patriotic bunch, aren’tthey? Very passionate but so are the English. It always makes for a good Test match.”With Genge having allayed concerns over a slight ankle injury sustained in training, his teammates believe he could make a big impact at the Principality Stadium. “He’s got an edge to him,” the England hooker, Jamie George, said.“When I play with him I know what we’re going to get and it’s an amazing thing to have. He will go hard and he’s going to be aggressive. You know you’re never going to have to give him a pump up he’s always ready to go.

The Mercedes team principal was speaking as teams gave their cars their full track debut at the first test here. Ferrari were quickest but Williams suffered a severe blow, admitting they were not ready to run for the opening two days of testing.Seven of the 10 F1 teams are based in Britain and there are nine European races this season. They employ a large number of people with a wide range of nationalities and are reliant on parts, equipment and materials coming in and out of the EU. Wolff warned Brexit would have a major impact.“Any major disruption with borders or taxes would damage the F1 industry in the UK,” he said. “Our team is an international team, including many EU citizens, and there is uncertainty at whether the industry will be impacted by a no-deal Brexit or a Brexit. That is damaging to what is to me one of the outstanding industries in the UK. It is the mother of all messes.”He was also concerned about the ability of F1 teams to attend races and perform at the highest level, reflecting a similar view to those the McLaren chief executive, Jonathan Neale, expressed in November.“If a no-deal Brexit happens like it is being discussed, it would have a major impact in terms of our operation going to the races and getting our car developed and ready,” said Wolff. “That is a nightmare scenario that I don’t want to envisage.”Mercedes have won the past five drivers’ and constructors’ championships and Lewis Hamilton has taken four of his five titles with the team, who employ what is understood to be approximately 1,100 people from 26 nationalities. They, as well as McLaren, Williams, Force India, Renault and Red Bull are based in the UK, while Haas have their headquarters in the USA but with a base in Banbury.Last week Williams cancelled their pre-test shakedown of their car and announced at the weekend it would not be ready to take part on day one of the test. The car arrived at the track on Monday morning.“It is looking more likely than not that we will now not be in a position to run on track until Wednesday at the earliest,” said the deputy team principal, Claire Williams. “This is extremely disappointing.”There are eight days of pre-season testing and Williams, who had a terrible season in 2018, finishing last in the constructors’ championship, will badly miss losing two full days.The other nine teams all managed to run successfully, with Ferrari looking particularly strong. Sebastian Vettel was quickest in both sessions and completed 169 laps. He was buoyant after he completed the day’s running and praised his team. “It was unbelievable, I think the car was working really well,” hesaid. “What they put on track today is very close to perfection in the first day of driving.” McLaren also enjoyed a solid start, with Carlos Sainz second to Vettel, four-tenths back.Red Bull, using their Honda power unit for the first time, were also well served with Max Verstappen fourth-fastest over 128 laps. Hamilton took the Mercedes for the afternoon session and he and his teammate, Valterri Bottas, put in 150 laps between them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c239ea3d438e2809080c03a50fba4bfe4ee9be1b/0_0_4197_2519/master/4197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e83131c538a53febcd616c198cc59c2","title":"come from away review phoenix theatre relentless post 911 canadian kindness","story":"Phoenix theatre, LondonThis musical about plane passengers erted to Newfoundland on 11 September has plenty of heart but not enough biteThis musical by the Canadian married team of Irene Sankoff and David Hein has grown from a regional success into a global phenomenon. You can see why: it records the hospitality shown by the people of Newfoundland to the 7,000 bewildered passengers on the 38 planes that were erted there after 911. It is musically vigorous and excellently staged but, although I may be in a minority of one, I found something bludgeoning about its relentless celebration of civic virtue.That is not to denigrate the exemplary behaviour of the citizens of Gander, nor the endurance of the puzzled passengers. The musical shows not only how people were fed, housed and entertained but also how lives were permanently changed. Two women, both of whose sons are firefighters, bond for life, and a diffident British oil exec discovers his future wife in an American orcee. But, while I get the point that unexpected good can come out of a disaster, I also hungered for rather more conflict. We see how an Egyptian Muslim is viewed with suspicion until it’s discovered he’s a great chef, and a gay couple’s relationship splinters after five days in Gander. For the most part, however, the show offers an affirmative, and unvarying, tribute to Canadian kindness.The songs, which have a folk-rock feel, are good and Christopher Ashley’s direction and Kelly Devine’s musical staging ingeniously use rearranged chairs to evoke both a suffocating plane cabin and the erse spaces opened to the visitors: there is one heartstopping moment when the passengers, hitherto kept in the dark about events in New York, gaze in silent horror at TV images of the Twin Towers. In a 12-strong ensemble, there are also striking performances from Rachel Tucker as a trailblazing female pilot, Robert Hands and Helen Hobson as loners who find love in unlikely circumstances and Jenna Boyd and Cat Simmons as two women united by maternal anxiety. The show could hardly be better done even if, as a work of art, I found it lacking in complexity and argument."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c10f8254c8a5ffdfba4ff24aaf9a092ddecc4b5/0_0_4834_2901/master/4834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d694b2c3b5a38ab3fbf4494f9f2afc36","title":"cold feet finally must watch tv series eight","story":"The drama about middle-class Mancunians has hit its stride at long last – thanks largely to a love affair that’s been bubbling under since the 90sWhen ITV first announced Cold Feet would be coming back after a 13-year absence, I was deeply sceptical. I enjoyed Mike Bullen’s tale of middle-class Mancunians, but by the time it finished in 2003 it felt less like an old friend you loved spending time with and more like an unwanted guest who lingers long after the party has come to a natural close.Times, and television, had moved on. Surely resurrecting Cold Feet was just another example of a channel scraping the barrel by rehashing the past instead of coming up with something new? Well, I hold my hands up and admit it: I was wrong.Yes, the sixth series of Cold Feet was patchy, and even with the seventh, Bullen was still writing his way back to these characters. But the eighth series, which comes to an end this evening, has been must-watch TV: a well-balanced mix of drama and comedy that has accurately reflected the reality of life for many people, while wringing humour out of even the most heartbreaking moments.We’ve seen Jenny (Fay Ripley) and Pete (Jon Thomson) deal with her breast cancer diagnosis, David (Robert Bathurst) slowly slip down the ladder into homelessness and Adam (James Nesbitt) and Karen (Hermione Norris) inch their way towards realising they love each other.This last plotline has been particularly well handled. Norris has long been Cold Feet’s unsung MVP, her steadfast, sensible Karen able to keep her head when all around are losing theirs. Nesbitt, by contrast, is often the worst thing about Cold Feet. His bumptious Adam has always walked the line between lovable and irritating, and as his character aged, the Jack-the-lad charm curdled further.The brilliance of this series is that it sees that. From the opening episode, in which Adam made a fool of himself chatting up a series of younger women at Ramona’s wedding, to the time he mistakenly believed a friendly barista must be attracted to him, it has been clear that he needs to grow up.His relationship with Karen, which blossomed from a wasted kiss at a music festival to a more serious moment last week, has felt utterly organic. It’s driven not by a stupid “Oh, let’s put this couple together for the sake of it” twist that so many TV romances are, but rather from a narrative inevitability that has always lurked in their friendship – and that has only grown in power because of the length of time we have spent with these characters.For, as Bullen’s writing makes clear, these are two people who have known each other for years, who have always liked each other, and who are coming together not in the first flush of lust but with a real sense of understanding. Each knows the other’s flaws and accepts that they will annoy each other, but they genuinely love each other and know that only this person will do. As a depiction of mature love it is smart, sensitive and absolutely believable.Bullen has been similarly astute in his depiction of Jenny’s diagnosis. Cancer plotlines are tricky to pull off as the temptation to lapse into maudlin sentiment is immense. Bullen has been largely careful to avoid this. (I say largely because Cold Feet has always leaned in to sentiment – not for nothing did the king of romantic comedy, David Nicholls, cut his teeth here.) Instead, the plot has concentrated on Jenny’s struggle for acceptance, her very real fears about the progression of the disease and last week, most movingly, what it means to her younger daughter Chloe, who is not Pete’s natural child.Then there’s David. Bathurst has always had the most difficult role in Cold Feet. The stiff and reserved David is often used as the force against which the other characters define themselves. Yet over the years, he is also the character who has changed the most.He has been tested by job losses and career shifts, shaken by the realisation that his place in the world is not guaranteed and slowly come to terms with his own upbringing and the damage it wrought. His slow slide into homelessness, and the way he wrestled with his pride rather than let those closest to him know, has been beautifully written. Like Jenny’s illness, there is never the sense that this is issue TV but rather a well-told story in which a series of decisions lead a character, whom thanks to some great writing we truly care about, to a certain point in their lives.This, ultimately, is why this series of Cold Feet has been such a joy. It’s partly the sense that for the first time since the revival was announced, we are truly hanging out with the characters we so enjoyed spending time with back in the day. And it’s partly the fact that those characters have grown and changed as we have grown and changed with them. But mostly it’s because while Cold Feet is at heart warm, comforting television, it is also a show driven by clever, mature writing that is confident enough to make us laugh in the most unexpected moments. Sometimes returning to the scene of past glories really does pay off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b32124ae30d93d7dd86423a4e23ffa6197c4fbd6/0_28_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8e03f3e2e141d782c9082ec9881f117","title":"rod rosenstein central figure behind mueller inquiry expected to step down official","story":"Justice department says deputy attorney general who brought in special counsel is likely to leave in mid-MarchRod Rosenstein, the US deputy attorney general who appointed a special counsel to investigate possible ties between Russia and President Donald Trump’s campaign, is expected to step down by mid March, a Justice Department official has said.Rosenstein had been expected to depart shortly after new Attorney General William Barr assumed office. Barr was confirmed for the role by the US Senate last week.The Justice official said Rosenstein’s departure was not related to renewed allegations that he considered wearing a wire in meetings with Trump and using the 25th amendment of the U.S. Constitution to remove the president from office.Rosenstein, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department, in May 2017 named Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate ties between Trump’s 2016 presidential election campaign and Moscow. The investigation continues.A registered Republican, Rosenstein made the decision because his then-boss, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a Trump supporter during the 2016 campaign, had recused himself from the issue.Last September, the New York Times reported Rosenstein in 2017 had suggested secretly recording Trump and recruiting Cabinet members to oust the president using the provisions of the Constitution’s 25th Amendment.In an interview broadcast on Sunday with CBS News 60 Minutes, former acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe confirmed the Times account that Rosenstein considered wearing a wire in meetings with Trump.Rosenstein said both the Times story and McCabe’s account were “inaccurate and factually incorrect,” which a Justice Department spokeswoman reiterated after the “60 Minutes” interview.Earlier on Monday Trump accused both McCabe and Rosenstein of planning a “very illegal act,” which he described in a tweet as “illegal and treasonous.“Rosenstein ceased overseeing Mueller’s probe on 7 November when Trump named Matt Whittaker acting attorney general.Barr now has oversight of the investigation.Rosenstein had attracted far more attention than is typical for the No. 2 Justice Department official because of his decision to appoint Mueller to lead the investigation eight days after Trump fired James Comey as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Trump has frequently and publicly seethed about the Mueller probe, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department, which oversees them both.The president has denied any collusion and Russia says there was no election meddling, despite findings to the contrary by U.S. intelligence agencies.Mueller’s investigation, which the president has repeatedly called a “witch hunt,” has so far netted 34 iniduals and three companies who have pleaded guilty, been indicted or been otherwise swept up in the inquiry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae4124514b0452174e52f7496e9eacd217785762/35_63_2266_1360/master/2266.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a01d650816db3f752787e96bc473272d","title":"islamist extremism in uk shamima begum","story":"Shamima Begum says she regrets innocent people died in attacks in both UK and SyriaThe east London schoolgirl who left the UK to join Islamic State has compared the Manchester Arena bombing to airstrikes by the western allies that killed non-combatants in Isis-held areas.Shamima Begum, 19, says she wants to return to Britain and is asking for “forgiveness”, having given birth to a son on Saturday while in a refugee camp in Syria.A debate has broken out about whether Begum, who travelled to Syria in 2015 aged 15, should be allowed to return to Britain having joined Isis, which has claimed responsibility for terrorist attacks on the UK.The Manchester Arena attack in May 2017 killed 22 people after a suicide bomber detonated a device packed with shrapnel at the end of a pop concert.In the latest of a series of interviews she has given while in the camp, Begum told the BBC she had regrets about the Manchester attack: “I do feel that is wrong. Innocent people did get killed,” she said.“It’s one thing to kill a soldier, it’s fine, it’s self-defence. But to kill people like women and children, just like the women and children in Baghuz who are being killed right now unjustly by the bombings. It’s a two-way thing really.”Begum continued: “This is kind of retaliation. Their justification was that it was retaliation so I thought that is a fair justification.”Begum’s departure to Syria was seen as a propaganda triumph for Isis, but Begum has said she had not wanted to become a poster girl for the group: “I didn’t want to be on the news at first. I did hear a lot of people were encouraged to come after, but I wasn’t the one who put myself on the news. We didn’t want to be on the news.”Amid the debate about whether she should be allowed to return to Britain, it has been asked whether legally she can be stripped of her British citizenship.The home secretary has suggested rewriting the 650-year-old law of treason to make it easier to prosecute returning jihadists.Sajid Javid told the Daily  it was “worth looking at carefully” whether the ancient law could be updated to be used against British extremists. Javid has previously said he would do everything in his power to prevent those who “hate Britain” from returning to the UK. Begum took full responsibility for her decision to leave Britain, saying she alone was “the one who made the choice”. She added: “Even though I was only 15 years old, I could make my own decisions. But I will admit, it’s my fault right now. I just want forgiveness from the UK. Everything I’ve been through, I didn’t expect I would go through that.”She said while in Britain she had been lured by Isis propaganda videos about the “good life they can provide”. She had also viewed beheading videos and those glorifying Isis fighters.The father of her newborn son is an Isis fighter and despite her four years with the sworn enemies of the UK, Begum said: “I actually do support some British values.”Begum also said in the latest interview that if she made it back to Britain and was charged and convicted, she wanted her family to look after her son.Her discovery in a camp last week has highlighted the issue of what western countries should do about their citizens who are now fleeing areas formerly controlled by Isis that have been retaken by its enemies.Downing Street has rejected Donald Trump’s call for Britain to take back extremists who have fought with Isis. Trump urged European countries, including the UK, to repatriate 800 captured Isis fighters to their home countries and put them on trial. He said that if they did not the US and its allies would be forced to release them.Responding to his calls, a No 10 spokesman said: “Foreign fighters should be brought to justice in accordance with due legal process in the most appropriate jurisdiction. Where possible, this should be in the region where the crimes had been committed. We continue to work closely with our international partners on this. The government will do all it can to ensure the safety and security of the UK.”Trump’s comments were echoed by a representative of Kurdish-led authorities in north Syria where about 800 foreign fighters are being held in prisons, along with about 700 women and 1,500 children in camps for displaced people. Abdulkarim Omar, co-chair of foreign relations in the Kurdish-led region, said they would not free foreign Isis detainees but countries must take responsibility for them. He described the detainees as a “timebomb”, saying fighters could escape if the Kurdish-led autonomous area was attacked.She added: “I see lots of legal, extremist, radical content online. There is a legitimate question of freedom of speech – we must protect freedom of expression in this country – but I want to see more challenging of extremist beliefs and extremist ideology. We all have a role in that regard. Schools can play an important role in having those conversations … Faith leaders have a role in deconstructing Islamist ideology and beliefs.”Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Khan said she was concerned about what had radicalised the 19-year-old and what lessons could be learned about what attracted her to extremist ideas.“It’s important to understand when she travelled … she was aware of Daesh beheadings and executions … was becoming more religiously inclined. There are questions about how a young girl was exposed to extremist ideology – some online – and what more we can do to counter than ideology.“What support can we give to families fearing their children are being targeted by Islamist extremists?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed6009c11fe19483cb63a4e95cfe7d6dfa50017e/585_579_3263_1957/master/3263.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aadd43d6ad88ddf5e17b99606ea7b85b","title":"syrian kurdish leader ilham ahmed international force kurds turkey border","story":"Ilham Ahmed says Kurds want observers on the border to ensure Turkey does not attackThe leader of the Syrian Kurds has called for a small international observer force to be stationed on the Turkey-Syria border to protect Kurds from what she says is the threat of crimes against humanity committed by Turkish forces.Ilham Ahmed is co-chair of the Syrian Democratic Council – the political arm of the US-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which have been responsible for liberating much of north-eastern Syria from Islamic State.Described as one of the most powerful women in Syria, Ahmed is leading a Kurdish delegation touring Washington, Paris and London to persuade western countries not to betray the Kurds by leaving them exposed to the threat of a Turkish attack.Ahmed said a final SDF assault on the last Isis redoubt would finish within days. Plans requiring “time and patience” were being drawn up to eradicate sleeper cells, she said.She was speaking in the wake of the shock announcement by Donald Trump that 2,000 US troops will leave north-west Syria on the basis that Isis had been defeated.Ankara views the Kurdish forces in Syria as a terrorist threat and an extension of the Kurdish separatist movement within Turkey’s own borders.The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has repeatedly warned America that a Turkish military operation against the US-backed Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) in Manbij is near. “Our patience is not limitless, he said over the weekend. “If the terrorists are not removed from Manbij within a few weeks, our waiting period will end.”Ahmed said: “After all that has happened, if there is an attack, we will regard those that remain silent in the face of those threats as guilty of crimes against humanity.“It is not just there will no longer be any trust in the coalition forces who we have fought alongside, and that their credibility will have been lost forever. It will mean the emergence of very big wars in this area.“Any attempt by the Turkish state to establish a safe zone in the north of Syria will be an occupation, and no matter that the Turkish state wants to convince others that it will be a force for calm in the region, this is not what will happen.“We saw this in Afrin last year as they tried to erase our culture and remove people from their homes. Huge massacres have been committed by the Turks. A further attack will only bring more war, displacement, occupation and an attempt to destroy our culture.”An international protection force would provide aerial defence, she said, but “we would like to see an international power on the border as observers to ensure that Turkey does not attack”.The force would be composed of “states that have actively participated in the war against IS, and the UN should also play a role”, she said. She added discussions were continuing now on the size and composition of the force, but it could be a symbolic number.She also said Kurds were willing to put foreign fighters on trial in Kurdish Syria if they were given major international support on the legal procedures. “It would be better if they were tried in their own countries,” she added.She said 800 to 900 Isis foreign fighters were currently held in prison by the Kurds and about 4,000 wives and children in refugee camps. She said: “We have not said we will let the fighters go, but if the Turks attack then it is true we will be fighting for our own existence and it is possible we may not be able to keep them under control and they may return to Europe. That is also at stake when we talk about an attack by the Turkish state.”Ahmed denied the Kurds were actively discussing forming a security alliance of convenience with the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, if the West decided it could not protect the Kurds from a Turkish assault.“The regime has shown no signs of interest in a meaningful dialogue with us about Syria’s future,” she said.Any such dialogue would require a change by the regime, including agreement to a political solution about the future of a federated and unified Syria."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3798289.1550522679!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"digital gangsters uk report on facebook welcomed in ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFacebook – and its founder, Mark Zuckerberg – were singled out for particular criticism. Photograph: Loic VenanceAFPGetty ImagesA damning Westminster report that found Facebook intentionally breached data privacy and competition law and should be regulated has been strongly endorsed by the chairwoman of the Oireachtas Committee on Communications.The report found online “fake news” is posing a threat to democracy and has described social media platforms as “digital gangsters”.It recommended global tech platforms including Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter should be subject to strict regulations and mandatory codes of practice.Hildegarde Naughton, chairwoman of the Oireachtas Communications Committee, said there was “absolutely no doubt that social media platforms need to be regulated, and harmful and illegal content removed as a matter of priority. This is not happening at present.”“I have been at the fore in calling for such regulation in Ireland,” she said.Ms Naughton said the Government had accepted the “days of self-regulation are over”.The Westminster report is the culmination of an 18-month investigation by the House of Commons committee on digital, culture, media and sport into fake news, disinformation and what were described as “dark adverts”, all of which it found were harmful to democracy.It concluded current British laws were not capable of dealing with practices such as hacking, use of multiple bots and the spread of malicious and hostile misinformation by anonymous actors.Digital gangstersFacebook – and its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, who refused to appear before the committee – were singled out for particular criticism.“Companies like Facebook should not be allowed to behave like ‘digital gangsters’ in the online world, considering themselves to be ahead of and beyond the law,” the report stated.Ms Naughton said she welcomed the robust conclusions and recommendations. The Fine Gael TD for Galway West participated in the Westminster hearings along with Green Party leader Eamon Ryan.The all-party Oireachtas Committee will be considering the Digital Safety Commissioner Bill 2017, which will introduce legislation. She said the committee was unanimous in the need for legislation to regulate social media. At present, such companies self-regulate content.Mr Ryan also welcomed the findings. “Our common experience was that social media companies such as Facebook are abusing their monopoly powers and need to be better regulated.”“Despite directions coming from national regulators, the company ignored the instructions and continued with the inappropriate sharing and exploitation of users’ personal information.“This culminated in the secretive use of the Facebook network during the Brexit referendum and US presidential election, which undermined their democratic systems.”He said the Government has a special responsibility because the European headquarters of Facebook was located in Dublin.Until now the Government has permitted tech giants to self-regulate. A private member’s Bill from Fianna Fáil TD James Lawless to regulate online political advertising has not progressed through the Dáil.In response to the report, Facebook rejected the suggestion it had breached data protection and competition laws, and said it shared the committee’s concerns about fake news and election integrity.“We are open to meaningful regulation and support the committee’s recommendation for electoral law reform,” said Facebook’s UK public policy manager, Karim Palant. “We also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users.”The backlash against online platforms’ treatment of users’ data began following disclosures of the widespread spreading of fake news and disinformation during the Brexit referendum and the 2016 presidential campaign in the US.Questionable practices and breaches of privacy were highlighted by the Cambridge Analytica scandal last year. A data company collected the profiles of millions of Facebook users, without their knowledge and consent, with the aim of influencing electoral contests."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3797976.1550508540!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"facebook censured by house of commons digital committee","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe House of Commons digital committee said ‘we need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people’. File photograph: Getty Images Facebook intentionally breached data privacy and competition law and should be subject to a new regulator to protect democracy and citizens’ rights, British politicians said on Monday.They also castigated other big tech companies in a damning report that singled out Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg for a failure of leadership and personal responsibility. The House of Commons digital committee said tech companies had proved ineffective in stopping harmful content on their platforms.This included disinformation, attempts by foreign countries to influence elections and risks to personal data.“We need a radical shift in the balance of power between the platforms and the people,” said committee chairman Damian Collins.Mr Collins said the age of inadequate self-regulation must end, following an 18-month investigation that concluded Facebook had “intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws”.“The rights of the citizen need to be established in statute, by requiring the tech companies to adhere to a code of conduct written into law by parliament, and overseen by an independent regulator,” he said.Facebook rejected the suggestion it had breached data protection and competition laws. The social media giant said it shared the committee’s concerns about false news and election integrity.“We are open to meaningful regulation and support the committee’s recommendation for electoral law reform,” said Facebook’s UK public policy manager Karim Palant. “We also support effective privacy legislation that holds companies to high standards in their use of data and transparency for users.”Politicians in Europe and the United States are grappling with the risks posed by big tech companies regulating the platforms used by billions of people.Germany has been at the forefront of the backlash against Facebook, fuelled by last year’s Cambridge Analytica scandal in which tens of millions of Facebook profiles were harvested without their users’ consent. Earlier this month, it ordered Facebook to curb its data collection practices in the country.US senator Marco Rubio, a former presidential candidate in the 2016 election, introduced a Bill last month aimed at giving Americans more control over data collected by online companies like Facebook and Alphabet’s Google.The British committee does not propose legislation, but does have the power to summon witnesses for its investigations.Did Zuckerberg attend the hearing?Facebook became the focus of its inquiry after whistleblower Christopher Wylie alleged that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica had obtained the data of millions of users of the social network.Mr Zuckerberg apologised last year for a “breach of trust” over the scandal.But he refused to appear three times before British politicians, a stance that showed “contempt” towards parliament and the members of nine legislatures worldwide, said the committee.“We believe that in its evidence to the committee Facebook has often deliberately sought to frustrate our work, by giving incomplete, disingenuous and at times misleading answers to our questions,” said Mr Collins. “Mark Zuckerberg continually fails to show the levels of leadership and personal responsibility that should be expected from someone who sits at the top of one of the world’s biggest companies.”Facebook, however, said it had co-operated with the investigation by answering more than 700 questions and providing four senior executives to give evidence.It said it had made substantial changes, including the authorisation of every political advert, and it was investing heavily in identifying abusive content.“While we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago,” said Mr Palant.The committee said it had identified major threats to society from the dominance of companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. Facebook also owns WhatsApp and Instagram. Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised adverts from unidentifiable sources, they said. Moreover, social media platforms are failing to act against harmful content and respect the privacy of users.Companies like Facebook are also using their size to bully smaller firms that relied on social media platforms to reach customers, it added. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3798335.1550527473!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain pushes for changes on backstop as brexit talks resume","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Stephen Barclay: Britain’s Brexit secretary  will resume his discussions with EU officials in Brussels.  Photograph: Hannah McKayReuters  Brexit talks resumed in Brussels on Monday night with a British focus almost entirely on legal language to put a time limit on the Irish backstop.But as the clock to British departure ran down to 40 days, EU officials and diplomats expressed increasing concern that London’s focus on the backstop – the insurance policy that guarantees an open border on the island of Ireland – made a deal ever more unlikely.British prime minister Theresa May arrives in Brussels on Wednesday for talks with European Commission president Jean Claude Juncker, while her Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay will simultaneously resume his discussions with EU officials.Mr Barclay told journalists that he and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier had a “positive” meeting on Monday, and suggested that its overrun was testimony to the constructive engagement of both sides.He said they had discussed the backstop, with British attorney general Geoffrey Cox, who was also present, exploring legal means to reconcile what British sources described as the gap between the Irish protocol’s description of the backstop as “temporary” and its “indefinite” legal effect.They also discussed the “Malthouse compromise”, a refashioned version of already-rejected British proposals for a technological\u0026nbspsolution to the Border.After also meeting Mr Barnier , Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney insisted they had agreed that the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement, reached in November, was not going to be reopened. Mrs May wants the EU to agree to changes to the backstop element of the deal. Mr Coveney said he did not believe it would be possible to resolve the backstop issue with legally binding language outside the Withdrawal Agreement, as reportedly suggested by Mr Cox: “That is essentially saying that you take the backstop out of the Withdrawal Agreement. That’s not going to happen ...”It remains unclear, however, whether Mr Cox, seen as a key persuader of backbenchers for Mrs May, perceives the reopening of the agreement as necessary.\u0026nbsp Such issues and potential legal language will be explored in the discussions on Wednesday.Raise expectationsMr Coveney said it was “important the UK doesn’t raise expectations in Westminster that there is a redrafting of the Withdrawal Agreement possible”.Echoing sentiments widely heard in Brussels, he pointed to what is seen in Brussels as the only viable way of forging a Brexit deal capable of winning both a House of Commons majority and EU approval, namely a British embrace of proposals from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. These involve the UK remaining in the customs union and large parts of the single market.“The EU is very open to that solution if the UK will actually pursue it,” he said. “But the onus has to be on London ... the logjam and problems are in London and the solutions have to come out of London.”In London Mr Corbyn faces new problems of his own as seven Labour MPs announced their defection from the party to form a new independent group. It is the largest exodus from any British parliamentary party since the establishment of the Social Democratic Party in 1981.The seven have been long-time critics of Mr Corbyn, not least on his Brexit policy. And the government was facing further embarrassment with the announcement by Japanese carmaker\u0026nbspHonda\u0026nbspof the closure of its only British car plant, in Swindon, in 2022 with the loss of 3,500 jobs,.Local conservative MP Justin Tomlinson insisted that “This is not Brexit-related. It is a reflection of the global market. They are seeking to consolidate production in Japan. ” Honda\u0026nbspsaid it would not be providing any comment on the “speculation”.\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Importantly, it also serves to highlight the huge range of iniduals that have contributed to science in the UK across all dimensions of ersity.However, campaigners have been displeased by the response, as the Governor still refused to rule out a white scientist being chosen. Zehra Zaidi, who is leading the Banknotes of Colour campaign, replied: “Our public institutions should reflect modern Britain. It is not political correctness but historical accuracy to reflect that Britain has always been a global country. People from across Empire, and later the Commonwealth, made this country their home and contributed greatly to its development.With Brexit looming, it is more important than ever to value these historical and cultural ties as we embark on new trading relationships. It is internationalism and the very ersity of the British workforce that has given the City of London a key advantage as a financial centre. Other central banks, like Canada and New Zealand, seeking to bridge the past, present and future of their respective countries, have put the first ethnic minority face on a banknote. “On 16 February 2018, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury Robert Jenrick MP backed our campaign in the . This followed a cross-party letter led by Helen Grant MP, the Conservative Vice-Chair for Communities, urging the Bank of England to act. The Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, replied yesterday by letter, stating that “the Bank takes its commitment to ersity very seriously, and that ersity issues are actively considered at every stage of the character selection process”. However, this is not reflected in the results so far.“The £50 note is the last in the current series of banknotes to change from paper to polymer. After the 2013 campaign for gender representation that culminated in the Jane Austen £10 polymer note, our campaign hoped that the Bank of England would be more receptive to arguments around ethnic minority representation. It has simply not taken our submissions on board.”Donald Trump threatens Venezuela\u0026#39s military if aid is blocked from entering countryDerek Hatton re-admitted to Labour 33 years after expulsion for Trotskyist Militant group membershipBrexit breakthrough is in God\u0026#39s hands, says Jean-Claude JunckerParental settings online failing to block violence, pornography and self-harmCannabis dog treats could be coming to a pet shop near you soonCold Feet, episode 6 review: back to its best and soon may it returnGrowing Up Gifted, review: a powerful insight into both teenage life and social mobilityJack the Ripper killed his victims while they were sleeping, historian claimsLabour Party split: Jeremy Corbyn warned he now faces a wave of new resignations with party in disarrayComment: Does the Independent Group want to replace Labour, or be something else entirely? Isil bride Shamima Begum suggests she is prepared to go to prison if Britain allows her backAncient treason laws could be rewritten in wake of Shamima Begum case, Sajid Javid suggestsChinese and Iranian hackers increase cyber attacks on USCabinet row breaks out over Huawei\u0026#39s alleged links to Chinese intelligence Florida inmates use criminal skills to rescue baby from carOscars nominees\u0026#39 $100,000 gift bag will include cannabis trufflesSexist judges will be brought to book, says Lord Chief JusticeDo not abandon us now, Kurdish leader tells the West as Isil battle draws to a close Police seek interview with Empire actor over reports he faked US \u0026#39hate-crime\u0026#39 assaultTory minister and four Conservative backbench MPs poised to join new Labour splinter group34 migrants rescued from one boat in Channel in biggest operation since ChristmasWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 18 february 2019","story":"Thousands of devotees crowd trains this weekend, trying to get home from the three-day long Bishwa Ijtema festival in Tongi, BangladeshDonald Trump threatens Venezuela\u0026#39s military if aid is blocked from entering countryDerek Hatton re-admitted to Labour 33 years after expulsion for Trotskyist Militant group membershipBrexit breakthrough is in God\u0026#39s hands, says Jean-Claude JunckerParental settings online failing to block violence, pornography and self-harmMark Carney suggests ethnic minority could be the face of new £50 note Cold Feet, episode 6 review: back to its best and soon may it returnGrowing Up Gifted, review: a powerful insight into both teenage life and social mobilityCannabis dog treats could be coming to a pet shop near you soonJack the Ripper killed his victims while they were sleeping, historian claimsLabour Party split: Jeremy Corbyn warned he now faces a wave of new resignations with party in disarrayComment: Does the Independent Group want to replace Labour, or be something else entirely? Isil bride Shamima Begum suggests she is prepared to go to prison if Britain allows her backAncient treason laws could be rewritten in wake of Shamima Begum case, Sajid Javid suggestsChinese and Iranian hackers increase cyber attacks on USCabinet row breaks out over Huawei\u0026#39s alleged links to Chinese intelligence Florida inmates use criminal skills to rescue baby from carOscars nominees\u0026#39 $100,000 gift bag will include cannabis trufflesSexist judges will be brought to book, says Lord Chief JusticeDo not abandon us now, Kurdish leader tells the West as Isil battle draws to a close Police seek interview with Empire actor over reports he faked US \u0026#39hate-crime\u0026#39 assaultTory minister and four Conservative backbench MPs poised to join new Labour splinter groupWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/02/15/12/african-churches-london-main.jpg","title":"african churches boom london backstreets southend baptism christian photos","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Some pastors take worshippers for full immersion baptisms in the cold of the Thames Estuary. Others believe that when congregants suddenly start speaking in unknown languages it marks the presence of the Holy Spirit.But the researchers from the University of Roehampton found things that many churches have in common, including a drive for professional advancement, a commitment to spend three hours or more at Sunday service and typically very loud worship.“That is how we express our joy and gratitude to God,” says Andrew Adeleke, a senior pastor at the House of Praise, one of the biggest African churches in Southwark, in a former theatre.“The church is not supposed to be a graveyard,“ Adeleke says. “It is supposed to be a temple of celebration and worship and the beauty is to be able to express our love to God, even when things are not perfect in our lives.”For some, the noise from amplified services is a problem, leading to complaints to local authorities from residents.But many churches face bigger challenges than unhappy neighbours: some provide food for people struggling to make ends meet, or work with young people at risk of recruitment by gangs.With clubs, churches and motorcycles, Berlin becomes home for migrantsAndrew Rogers, who led the University of Roehampton researchers, says pastors have to juggle retaining the churches’ African identity while appealing to children of first-generation immigrants, many of whom have never lived outside Britain.They typically have a more liberal world view which can be hard to reconcile with conservative Pentecostal teachings.Rogers recalls speaking to one pastor who lamented he was unable to talk about religious miracles to his children.“If the church doesn’t adapt, then they are going to leave and look elsewhere,” Rogers says.Reporting by William Schomberg, ReutersWe’ll tell you what’s true.

And they could be as big a change as when the wires dropped out of Apple\u0027s existing headphones and they were first born.Introduced in 2016, the two truly wireless earphones haven\u0027t been updated since. They came with a wide range of futuristic features – but a range of rumours have swirled around them about new updates, that would bring new and even more futuristic features.The AirPods are actually two (or three) different things: the case that protects them and the earphones that sit inside. Until recently, they\u0027d be considered one and the same – but recent leaks have suggested that Apple might update the two separately, with different release dates.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAccording to recent rumours, the new case is likely to arrive earlier, and maybe soon. It could even be a part of Apple\u0027s March event. The actual release date is probably dependent on when Apple releases the AirPower mat that it\u0027s charging could rely on.The earphones themselves are likely to undergo a more dramatic reinvention. But that could also take longer to arrive. Those could not be updated for some months, according to recent rumours – and perhaps won\u0027t even arrive until September, when the new phones are introduced.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

And most of the rumours focus around how exactly it would do that.New AirPods charging case could come before updated earphonesMost likely, the biggest change in any new case would be the addition of wireless charging. That would allow them to charge up just like a phone, being able to be plonked down a wireless charging puck and then transfer that into its battery as well as the AirPods themselves.Apple has actually teased a new case before, when it announced the AirPower wireless charging mat. It said that a new case would be needed to allow the AirPods to be charged through that new product – but then the new product never actually arrived.The company did say then that the case would be updated but that the existing AirPods would be compatible with the new one. And people would be able to pay a reduced price just to buy the case and update, it made clear – an offer that will presumably stay around with the new earphones.Another rumoured change includes the addition of a new and grippier kind of plastic, which should make the box easier to hold. And if as suggested Apple does introduce new colours of AirPods, such as black, presumably the case will also change colour too.But it\u0027s the earphones that have most of the technology. Rumours have suggested that a whole host of new (and sometimes strange)\u0026nbspfeatures could be coming to the new earbuds.The most likely feature – in part because it\u0027s been apparently revealed by Apple\u0027s own software – is always-on Hey Siri. That will mean that people don\u0027t have to do the uncomfortable move of tapping their own ears to wake the earphones up, and instead just say Hey Siri any time they\u0027re wearing their AirPods to speak with the voice assistant.Other rumoured updates including new health tracking tools. Apple has been keen to get into those features with technology like the Apple Watch, and the inside of people\u0027s ears is a great place to take readings for things like heartbeat and temperature, which could happen with future AirPods.Apple is also likely to improve the performance in less obvious ways. The new buds will probably feature better wireless connectivity, and improved waterproofing.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Since then, prices have slid on a consistent basis, only recently showing moderate signs of recovery.These optimistic price movements, combined with a strong volume of apprximately $27 billion in the market, may well suggest that the long-awaited bull market is not far away, Mati Green, a senior market analyst at the online trading platform eToro, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.Still, until bitcoin sees a strong breakout above the psychological level of $5,000, the longest bear market in cryptocurrency\u0027s short history continues.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album.

Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHRumours have been swirling about potential headliners.Janet Jackson, Taylor Swift, Fleetwood Mac and Paul McCartney have all been named as possible options, though no official decision\u0026nbsphas been announced.In 2017, Fatboy Slim claimed in an interview with\u0026nbspNME\u0026nbspthat Glastonbury is becoming “less dangerous” and “more middle-class”, adding:\u0026nbsp“It used to be quite a hairy place to be at times.

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct.

Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm.

The main upgrades will include tools that allow the phones to use precise indoor positioning and navigation, a frosted glass casing, better Face ID facial recognition, and bigger batteries.The biggest new feature however is said to be a triple-lens camera, which is endorsed by the new report and has been widely rumoured.

That was first shown off in 2017, as a wireless charger that could power up AirPods, an iPhone and an Apple Watch at the same time – but despite the promise it would come soon, nothing has been said about it since, and some have even suggested it might not be coming at all.The AirPods themselves will also receive an update. They will include wireless charging capabilities and improve Bluetooth – and might also feature a whole range of other more exciting upgrades.Both the AirPods and AirPower mat are expected to be released in the first half of the year. Apple almost always releases new iPhones in September, and it is not clear when the Macs will arrive.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Therefore any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the six months that should be remaining for travel to most countries in Europe.The \u0027blue\u0027 passport, like Brexit, is an international embarrassmentCombining these two rule changes means that\u0026nbspthere are some passports out there which could be rejected even though they expire 14 months and 29 days after the date of travel.\u0026nbspHowever, these rules do not apply when travelling to Ireland. To try to eliminate any confusion, the government website has a new passport checker service to see whether\u0026nbspyou should renew your documents or not.If the UK leaves with a deal, travel to the EU should\u0026nbspremain the same as now until at least 31 December 2020.That would mean\u0026nbspUK passports would\u0026nbspbe valid for travel anywhere in the Schengen area (the vast majority of EU countries as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) up to and including the expiry date.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

They’re from different backgrounds but are united in their belief that we can #ChangePolitics.”Will there be by-elections?If an MP resigns from their party but wishes to continue on as an independent candidate\u0026nbspthere is no formal requirement for a by-election to be held.\u0026nbspLabour sources have been reported as saying the departing MPs should submit themselves for by-elections as they were elected on a Labour manifesto.Responding to a question about holding elections Mr Leslie said “by-elections are absolutely not what is needed right now” due to the “national upheaval” that has been caused by Brexit.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Now we have lost Luciana, one of our most dedicated and courageous MPs.“If someone like Luciana no longer believes there is a home for her in the Labour Party then many other colleagues will be asking themselves how they can stay.If someone like Luciana no longer believes there is a home for her in the Labour Party then many other colleagues will be asking themselves how they can stay“That’s why time is short for us. To confront the scale of the problem and meet the consequences. To keep others from leaving.”One source involved in the split on Monday told The Independent that other MPs\u0026nbspwere close to quitting and would follow depending on what happened over Brexit in the coming weeks.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn his statement, Mr Watson said that “a virulent form of identity politics has seized” control of Labour, and said Mr Corbyn’s team now must “reflect the balance of opinion” across all MPs in the parliamentary party.He also lashed out the “hard Left”, who he claimed “can be too easily tempted into the language of heresy and treachery”.It came after the MPs faced a wave of abuse in the wake of their decision to leave, including fellow MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle who compared them to “cowards”.The Young Labour twitter account posted a line from the party’s anthem, The Red Flag, reading: “Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer, we’ll keep the red flag flying here.”I’m a Remainer but I feel betrayed by the defecting Labour MPsWhy an area ‘showered with EU cash’ still thinks Brexit is a good ideaShadow chancellor John McDonnell called on the breakaway group to do “the honourable thing” and fight to retain their seats, while Unite union boss Len McCluskey hit out at the “splitters” who had “no stomach for a fight for Labour’s core values”.The decision to quit the party had been the result of months of soul searching for the MPs, with one telling The Independent: “I’ve been getting out of bed every morning for the past two years thinking, ‘Shall I resign from the Labour Party today or tomorrow?’”The most recent Brexit votes on 14 February appear to have been a tipping point for some angered by Mr Corbyn’s reluctance to support a second referendum.One source in the breakaway group said: “We were looking at the amendments that the Labour Party was putting down and hoping, I was hoping anyway, on the 14th we would have had a little more movement on a People’s Vote but in fact we ended up going backwards and it wasn’t referenced at all.“Clearly a lot of us have had issues with the leadership of the party going back quite some time ... We tried everything to save the Labour Party.”Mr Corbyn’s response to the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal also “crystallised” concerns, another MP said, arguing they were not prepared to sponsor a government led by him.As she resigned, Ms Berger said Labour had become “institutionally antisemitic”, while Mr Gapes, a former chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, told the press conference Labour is now a “racist, antisemitic party”.Corbyn accused of ditching Labour’s Brexit policy by party delegatesHe added: “Jeremy Corbyn and those around him are on the wrong side on so many international issues – from Russia, to Syria, to Venezuela. A Corbyn Labour government would threaten our national security and international alliances.”Mr Umunna called on MPs from Labour and other parties to “leave the old tribal politics behind” and join the new independent group.He said: “It is time we dumped this country’s old-fashioned politics and created an alternative that does justice to who we are today and gives this country a politics fit for the here and now, the 21st century not the last one.“We’ve taken the first step in leaving the old tribal politics behind and we invite others who share our political values to do so too.”As well as other Labour MPs, there has been speculation that some Tories may consider joining the new group, with several facing deselection moves in their local associations due to their soft-Brexit stance.Among those is the Tory MP for Grantham, Nick Boles, who said: “They’re all good people and I understand completely why they felt driven to leave Labour.“I have not spoken with any of them about their plans and am totally focused on working with MPs of all parties to stop a no-deal Brexit on 29 March.”Work now begins in earnest on framing what the Independent Group stands for and how it will be run, with its first meeting due in the coming days.A source said they needed to get moving quickly or “the machines of the existing parties are going to come after us in a very significant way”.“It’s D-Day today”, the MP added.Sources were keen to emphasise their independence from pro-EU campaigns such as People’s Vote and also from prominent figures like ex-Labour prime minister Tony Blair – despite their support for a Final Say referendum.Scant detail has emerged about how the group is going to be funded, apart from a crowdfunding page which crashed when the announcement was made.Asked whether they had union funding, one MP said they respected the union movement but joked it was “nice to be free” as most were run by a “tiny clique”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Her parents were at a nearby restaurant.It was due to be the penultimate day of the McCann family holiday. Angela Gallop CBE was the scientist who found vital evidence that solved two of the UKs most notorious murders - Stephen Lawrence and Damilola Taylor.The forensic biologist, , now wants to solve the disappearance of Madeleine, who was three when she vanished from her parents’ holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal in .She told the Sunday Times Magazine: It would be extraordinarily dficult because its in a dferent country and you dont know whats happened to the exhibits.Ive been involved in cases where it looks hopeless, so Im not too daunted by anything these days. Every contact leaves a trace, its just finding it.The apartment is on the edge of travel firm Mark Warners Ocean Club resort.The Ocean Club is one of several tourist sites in the popular holiday town.It is located close to the larger town of Lagos, about an hours drive from Faro airport.In February  the apartment was sold to a British gran for £, – half the asking price.Police have recorded thousands of potential sightings of missing Maddie since . Madeleine vanished on May , , when her family, from Leicestershire, were holidaying in the Algarve, Portugal.Parents Gerry and Kate left their three children – including toddler twins Sean and Amelie – sleeping in their apartment while they dined at a nearby tapas bar.When Kate ed to check on the kids at around pm that evening, she discovered that Maddie was not in her bed.In September of that year Gerry and Kate were named as ‘arguidos’ by Portuguese police.While arguido is often translated as ‘suspect’, it actually means a person being questioned under caution.The following summer the McCanns were cleared by investigators in Portugal who declared they had exhausted all avenues in the case.In , Maddie’s distraught parents met with then-home secretary Theresa May to talk about the hunt for their daughter.The following year, Scotland Yard launched its own review, named Operation Grange, into the case at the behest of the future PM.Two years later Scotland Yard said it had uncovered new leads while Portuguese police reopened their case.In October , Operation Grange was scaled down from  detectives to just four.Last December, the Tory government injected extra funding into the operation as cops investigated a new theory that Maddie was snatched by a human trafficking ring.In October, cops said they were now hunting a person of signicance in a shock new development.A source close to Scotland Yards search Operation Grange said the person is now a critical line of inquiry in the £million investigation.And a former Met police chief called for a fresh interview of Maddies parents and the Tapas Seven - who have never been quizzed by British cops.In November  it emerged a new line of enquiry saw cops travel to Bulgaria to try and track down a paedophiles widow.In March , Scotland Yard won Home Office funding to continue chasing a vital final line of enquiry for a further six months.Following the conclusion of that six-month period, Scotland Yard made a formal request to the Home Office for a further six months of funding.Maddie turned  on May , .In April , UK cops released a computer-generated image of Maddie showing what she would look like aged nine.A number of potential leads have emerged since the little girl vanished, but none have amounted to anything and no arrests have ever been made.In January , Maddies parents were boosted by the news that -year-old American schoolgirl Jayme Closs had been found three months after her kidnap.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Amy could do nothing about this, for the woman who had punched her in the face and kicked her as she lay crumpled on the floor was her master, and Amy was her slave.Shes one of an estimated , victims of slavery in the UK, who live alongside us unnoticed - washing our cars, painting our nails and cleaning our neighbours houses, hiding in plain sight up and down the country. And when slaves do manage to escape from their masters - , were rescued in Britain last year - they are shockingly only entitled to  days of help from the government.Which is why The Sun is today launching a campaign to Stamp Out Slavery, in conjunction with Co-Op, backing Lord McColls victim support bill, which proposes to extend support given to rescued slaves from  days to one year.Here, speaking exclusively to Sun Online, Amy, now , tells her story.Domestic slavery might sound like something out of a Victorian novel, but last year alone  people, like Amy - including  children - were rescued from domestic servitude across Britain.As her story proves, almost anyone can be forced into slavery.Amy, an -year-old orphan, was bursting with excitement when she flew over to the UK from Ghana.After the death of her parents in , she was befriended by a lovely woman called Mary who offered to take her to the UK to become a nanny.She tells Sun Online: “My parents died and suddenly I was alone. I dropped out of school and had no-one.She says: “She knew I didn’t have family and was a hard worker, so she got me a passport paid £, so I could travel over. I was going to look after her five-year-old daughter and I couldnt wait.“Because of the money she’d spent, I felt like I owed her big time.”But within days of arriving in the UK, Amy realised all wasnt as it appeared and it soon became clear that she wasnt here to look after Marys child.Once in the UK, Marys tone changed and she made Amy sleep on the floor with no duvet or mattress.Within a week, she was forced into working -hour shts cleaning Marys flat - and went days without eating.Amy says: “I went through hell.She told me I had to sleep on the floor. Her friend offered me a free mattress, but she said I didn’t deserve it.The only clothes I had were hand-me-downs and I slept about four hours a night. She didn’t want to see me sleeping -she was in the house and awake I had to stay up just in case.“I’d sneak one or two meals in when she was out - I’d have eggs and rice, just cooking leftovers.Every day I had to hand wash all Mary and her daughter’s clothes and I wasn’t allowed to use the hot water.“I was trapped and felt suicidal.”Sobbing as she remembers her ordeal, Amy says that Mary pimped her out to strangers who came to the flat.“Within a month she began to let men sleep with me.It happened twice a week - men came over, paid her a handful of notes, raped me and left.The first time it happened it was really bad. I told her I couldn’t do it and she said I could, because I’d already been raped.If Amy didn’t do as she was told, she was threatened.Amy says: “She took my passport and told me to stay away from the police, andI talk to them she would stab me with a screwdriver. So I just did what she asked.”After  months, Amy reached breaking point.One day while Mary was out, Amy seized the opportunity and found courage to flee, frantically breaking down the lock on the front door.With nowhere to go, she ended up homeless. But sleeping rough on Londons streets seemed like a better option than spending another day under her mistress tyrannical rule.   A few months later, Amy bumped into Mary on the street.Amy says: “She slapped me and demanded I collect my belongings. Then she called the police, who called immigration.”Now, Amy lives in temporary accommodation in the Midlands, supported by The Sophie Hayes Foundation, a charity set up to help victims of trafficking.She says: “I don’t trust people. I don’t sleep properly and am on antidepressants. For a long time, I wanted to take my own le. I didn’t see the point of living in this world.Sadly, stories like Amy’s are far from unique. Elvira, , from the Philippines also arrived at Heathrow in  and was taken to a luxury flat in London’s Kensington where she was forced to work  hours a day.“I had to work all the time, without a day off, and I slept on the floor by her bed,” Elvira toldin .  “My mistress would shout at me, saying I was stupid or call me a “dog”. I was given just a piece of bread and cup of tea for the whole day. I became emaciated. I felt like a slave, like I was in prison.”She wanted to run away but her captors had her passport.One morning, when he employer went for a nap, she found the keys to the door and ran. Hiding in a nearby church, she called for help.Thankfully she did manage to escape. Of the  referrals for potential victims of domestic servitude made last year,  were female but it shows its not only women who are at risk.Ofonime Inuk was  and an orphan when he was lured to the UK from Nigeria and kept as a slave for  years in the West London home of NHS doctor Emmanuel Edet and his we.His passport was confiscated and he was forced to work -hour days cooking and cleaning, with a thin foam mattress in the hallway as his bed.In  Edet and his we were sentenced to six years in prison but Mr Inuk, now , said: “I’m not going to get my le back, it’s gone now.”Brenda, , from South East Asia, was beaten, abused and kept as a prisoner for four years by a London family.As a single mother, shed sought work abroad to provide for her two children but was not never allowed tohome.“I was forced to care for a bed-ridden old man and was beaten badly, she tells Sun Online. I was only fed his leftovers and he called me animal.It went on for four years. I was starved, they held my passport and locked me in.Her chance to escape finally came when cleaners knocked on the door of the apartment and she screamed through the door.The cleaners called  and  minutes later the officers freed her. Brenda says: I was scared, because I didn’t have anything, only my clothes. I didn’t know what to do.”The UK recognised a staggering , victims from  countries in , including adults who had been used for organ harvesting and children that were forced into sexual exploitation.At present, trafficked victims have just  days support after being freed before they are expected to leave the UK and are deported by the Home Office.During this short time, they are given accommodation, financial aid, medical treatment, counselling, a support worker, a translator and legal advice.We want the government to: Back Lord McColls proposed bill, which suggests all victims of modern slavery should be given a years support to recover.Alongside that they should be given special support to help them, including housing benefits, financial help and other services.She was directed to the National Referral Mechanism, a framework for pinpointing victims of human trafficking or modern slavery and ensuring they receive the appropriate support.But after  days, the Home Office issued a negative decision on Brendas right to asylum.She was removed from her safe-house and referred to charity, Kalayaan.Working on her behalf, the charity launched legal action against the Home Office who are now reassessing Brenda’s situation.She has been waiting for a decision on her claim for four years. During this time she has not had permission to work so her children have continued to struggle back home. “I am angry,” says Brenda. “I need justice.” Thinking of her children, she starts to cry. “It’s a long time since I have seen them. I miss them so much.”Last year, Wiltshire Polices #telluswhatyousee campaign went viral, after they released a seemingly innocuous video of a woman cleaning the windows of an ordinary suburban house and taking out the rubbish. The video aimed to highlight that modern slavery can be very dficult to spot, and flagged up the signs to watch out for.Justine Currell, Director at modern slavery charity Unseen, says: “Domestic servitude is one of the most hidden and under-reported forms of modern slavery, taking place mostly behind closed doors.Heartbreaking stories like these are why The Sun is backing calls for a change in the law so that specialist support given to modern slavery victims – including forced labour and human trafficking – is increased from as little as  days to a full year, as they rebuild their lives. You can sign the petition for the Modern Slavery Victim Support Bill here.Find out more about Co-Ops Bright Future programme, which offers employment to survivors of modern slavery, here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It repeats endlessly that the withdrawal agreement is closed and that it isn’t going to reopen it.When the Brady amendment passed the House of Commons, saying Parliament would accept the dealthe backstop was replaced, the EU responded by saying they didn’t think this Parliament majority was “stable”.Thursday night’s vote helps them make that argument.As one No source laments: “We don’t want to give the Europeans a chance not to engage with us.”I understand that when the Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, dined in Brussels this week Sabine Weyand — the EU’s deputy negotiator — spent her time telling him that a customs union was the only major change available to the backstop.The EU think that Corbyn’s support for it means that a customs union could pass Parliament. I am told Barclay attempted to disabuse them of this idea.Mrs May can’t entirely escape blame for this week’s fiasco.No should have made sure that its own MPs were happy with the wording before publishing the motion.“She’s like a football team that can’t string two wins together,” complains one minister.But the Tory Brexit ultras should have paid more heed to the real-world consequences of their actions.Another effect of Thursday night’s defeat for the Government is that it increases the chances of the Cooper amendment passing on February .This would compel the Government to seek an extension to Article Mrs May hasn’t won Parliament’s support for an exit deal by March .One Cabinet minister, with close links to several of the ministers who might quit to ensure this amendment goes through, tells me it is now “much more likely” to pass.This Secretary of State complains that the Government’s defeat “makes it harder to make the argument that we should hold our nerve” as “the best evidence for holding your nerve was that the outcome would be the same as when the Brady amendment went through”.Another minister warns: “If she doesn’t come back with something cooking by the th, there’ll be trouble.”I understand those around Mrs May know they need to have shown progress by the th.One insider tells me: “If the Government doesn’t want Parliament to take control, they need to have a plan.They can’t just sit there for two weeks.”Other Cabinet ministers aren’t so sure Cooper will pass.One tells me: “I don’t think the ministers will resign, andthey don’t resign, then it doesn’t pass.”If Cooper does go through, politics will enter into an even more unpredictable phase. One May Cabinet ally is predicting a general electionthis happens.But it is hard to see how a general election could end in anything other than disaster for the Tories in these circumstances.If Mrs May is forced to ask the EU for an extension but with no Parliamentary agreement in sight, the EU is more likely to offer a long extension than a short one.I understand the view in several EU capitals is that the longer the extension, the more likely it is that the political dynamics in the UK will change.But a long extension would prolong this damaging, political uncertainty.This Government, and this Parliament’s, job is to get Brexit done. Time is running short. Both Parliament and the Government need to get their act together.But it may well be because the NHS – traditionally Labour’s strongest suit – is not the most important issue in politics right now.But that number is down to  per cent this winter, according to the pollster Ipsos Mori.The question now is whether the Tory decision to spend an extra £billion a year on the health service by  leads to a decline in public concern.But in January AE departments recorded their worst waiting times since the figures started being collected in .Matt Hancock, the new Health Secretary, is setting up a new NHS-X unit to try to bring the health service into the digital era, which would help the NHS to better use its resources.There are many things the Tories have to do to win the next election – not least, deliver Brexit – but they must also reassure voters on the NHS.Butthey can be ed they should be subject to the full force of the law.Justice must be done and must be seen to be done.Churchill wouldn’t have been Prime Minister but for the Labour Party’s willingness to serve in a government led by him.When it came to the crucial decision to fight on in , Clement Attlee and Arthur Greenwood, two Labour members of the War Cabinet, were more solid than some of Churchill’s Tory colleagues.But Attlee and Greenwood came from a very dferent Labour tradition to McDonnell: They weren’t Marxists or Trotskyists.There are some Labour MPs who are just not prepared to try to put into power people who are so outside the traditional bounds of the party.One minister likens the coming Tory leadership race to the  Grand National, when a crowded field led to a pile-up at the rd fence and the victory of the - outsider Foinavon.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We don’t believe they’ll get a No Deal exit either, and eventhey did the short-term chaos would kill their party.Instead Parliament would postpone Brexit, possibly finishing the Tories for a generation. This current purgatory would go on for months longer — maybe long enough for Remainers to reverse the referendum result.The Government would have failed in its only mission. It would instead have undermined our democracy and ensured bitter isions that would never heal.The one person unable to compromise, oddly, is the Prime Minister. Because what Brussels, Labour and Tory Remainers glibly ask of her, a permanent customs union, ALSO wrecks her party and destroys Brexit’s economic case.It was folly to expect the Tory ERG group to vote to “take No Deal off the table” on Thursday night. Logic was on their side, at least.But they need to think hard now how they will feel on March Brexit is put off and they are blamed. If they have opened the door to a toxic, anti-Semitic, anti-Western Labour rabble so crazed by ideology they cannot even allow Winston Churchill’s historic defeat of Nazism to trump his other failings.A party committed to massive tax rises, maybe even a  per cent windfall levy on anyone’s “wealth”. A party led by pension-age Marxist revolutionaries friendly to Putin, Hamas, the IRA and hard-left dictators but hard on private enterprise, job-creation and free speech.We sincerely hope Labour moderates stop dithering and resign to undermine Corbyn and McDonnell.

And it was an old-school print journalist, the brilliant Anthony Loyd of The Times, who found Begum in a Syrian refugee camp containing almost , people.Loyd’s interview with her is a gripping insight into the twisted mind of a British youngster who ran off to join IS’s murderous caliphate. And the BBC had bugger all to do with it.While BBC staffers were sipping their skinny lattes and nibbling almond croissants in Broadcasting House, a journalist from The Times got his scoop the hard way, tramping into a chaotic refugee camp in one of the most dangerous parts of the world.Why does this matter  Because this country has one of the most vibrant newspaper industries on the planet.And the bloated, over-funded BBC is KILLING it.The Cairncross Review, a Government report into the future of UK journalism, revealed this week how tax-dodging tech giants Facebook and Google, together with the publicly-funded BBC are annihilating our free Press.They have already destroyed what was once affectionately known as “the local rag”.Over the past seven years, hundreds of local papers have shut down and thousands of regional journalists have lost their jobs. , journalists worked on local newspapers in  — now it is just ,. And it is your money that bankrolls the BBC.At a time when the BBC is contem­plating ditching free TV licences for the over-s, the debate we should REALLY be having is about how much of your money we should be chucking at Auntie.We have a great newspaper industry and it is worth preserving.Because it wasn’t the BBC that broke the story of MPs fiddling their expenses — it was a newspaper . And it wasn’t the BBC that broke the story about charity Age UK receiving £million from an energy company to flog gas and electricity to pensioners — it was a newspaper .It wasn’t the BBC that dared to publish the names of the killers of Stephen Lawrence — it was a newspaper .And what was the most-read story on the BBC last year  Strictly minx Katya Jones snogging Seann Walsh  — a Sun on Sunday exclusive.The BBC, like Facebook and Google, is a parasite that lives off the flesh of real news-gatherers.What makes the BBC dferent from the tax-dodging tech giants is that we love it. And you can’t grow up in this country and not have a deep and abiding affection for the BBC.I have endless happy memories of the BBC — from Match Of The Day to Top Of The Pops, from David Attenborough documentaries to The Likely Lads, from Fawlty Towers to the Hairy Cornflake.But the BBC has got far too big, far too bloated and far too wealthy.Lord Reith, the visionary behind it, wanted our state broadcaster to “inform, educate and entertain”. Lord Reith never dreamed of a state broadcaster that was all-powerful.The BBC gets far too much of your money and spends it far too easily. Why does the BBC need to be over every nook and cranny of the internet To the generation growing up on Netflix and YouTube with an entire universe on their smartphones, the BBC pocketing more than £ a year from everyone with a TV set is absurd.The BBC has got too big for its publicly-funded boots.That’s what we should be talking about — not the merits of free TV licences for granny and grandad!The Cairncross Review told how the BBC’s expansionist online empire has come very close to destroying the local newspaper industry.Are we really going to keep giving the BBC £billion every year so it can do the same to the national newspaper industry In the same week as the Cairncross Review came out, Bruce Sharma, , fought off thieves armed with a hammer and a machete with just his rolled-up copy of The Sun.Bruce was reading The Sun in Ram Stores in Long Eaton, Derbys, when the hooded pair burst in demanding money. “Instinct took over and I tried to whack them with the paper,” says Bruce.You can’t do that with a TV licence.GORDON Banks lit up my childhood.For my generation – a wide-eyed kid on that magical summer’s day in  – those World Cup winners will always feel like family.Gordon never got a knighthood.

such as that caused by diabetes or glaucoma - to the the optic nerve or retina can also cause loss of colour recognition.Scientists already know that exposure to chemicals found in cigarettes like carbon disulphide and styrene can damage vision but there are few studies linking smoking to colour vision deficiency.The new research, which was published in the journal Psychiatry Research, indicates that smoking could damage the blood vessels in the eyes, causing colour vision deficiency.It is sometimes called being colour blind, though complete colour blindness is rare.The condition is usually inherited but it can sometimes develop later in le because of illness.It occurs when some of the colour sensitive cells in the eyes are either missing or dont work properly.Most people with the condition struggle to distinguish between red, yellow and green, known as red-green colour vision deficiency.In rare cases some people have trouble with blues, greens and yellows, which is now as blue-yellow colour vision deficiency.Smokers are also doubly at risk of developing age-related macular degeneration, a common condition which damages vision over time.Every year around , people in the UK die from smoking, according to the NHS.It causes cancer in many parts of the body, including the lung, mouth and throat.Smokers are also at a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack and stroke."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000470094921.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"british town no cash machines residents cough up","story":"Branches of Nationwide, NatWest and Lloyds in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, have all shut down in the last three years.The only remaining ATM in the town centre charges for withdrawal.Other cash points are based outside the centre and at retail parks – most of which charge between p and £. for withdrawals.Business owners and shoppers in Burslem -

The gaping wounds left by this internal conflict could soon prove fatal to him.There were sharp intakes of breath yesterday when seven moderate Labour MPs announced they have resigned to set up a new Independent Group.Their number may be small — and none of them, except perhaps Chuka Umunna, may be household names — but their move is certain to have a huge impact on British politics.It throws the Opposition into chaos.  Beleaguered by dismal poll ratings, serial incompetence, isions over Brexit and accusations of extremism, Corbyn will now come under brutal pressure.The Gang of Seven’s decision to quit will feed into the narrative that he is a Marxist mediocrity, whose toxic spell at the helm since  has not only dragged his party to the lunatic fringe but has also allowed vicious anti-Semitism and intolerance to flourish.The seven splitters made precisely those charges yesterday, using language that  will be gleefully exploited by Labour’s opponents.Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree who has endured death threats and deselection attempts from socialist zealots, said she would be “sickened and ashamed to remain in the Labour Party” because of the  “culture of bullying, bigotry and intimidation”.Equally powerful was Chris Leslie,  the Nottingham East MP, who argued that Labour had been “hijacked by the machine politics of the hard Left”, peddling “abuse and hatred”.Labour’s turmoil follows the battering that Corbyn received in a new book by investigative journalist Tom Bower.With a wealth of shocking details, it exposes the full scale of the Labour leader’s dreary left-wing fanaticism, his links to anti-Semitism, his anti-British instincts and his low intellectual calibre.As the book graphically demonstrates, never was there any politician less fitted for the premiership.Given the y charge sheet against Corbyn, it is amazing that the party split did not happen earlier. But the moderates hung on in the forlorn hope that Corbyn might change or that Labour might move back towards the centre ground.There was never any chance of that.Corbyn and his dogmatic followers are not interested in compromise or debate — only in enforcement of their warped ideology.  They have turned what was once a broad church into a narrow personality cult.In fact, many Corbynites, like a kind of Trotskyite Taliban, welcome the split because they see it as an opportunity to rid the socialist creed of impurities.“Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer, we’ll keep the Red Flag flying here,” screeched the infantile Young Labour movement.Yet the charge of cowardice is an absurd one to make at the splitters.It took courage to quit. Most of them had relatively safe Labour seats. Yet they have put their political careers and livelihoods at risk in protest at Corbyn.In addition, they will be forced to endure a barrage of abuse from party members, since Labour is a profoundly tribal movement, where betrayal is regarded as the darkest sin of all.But this will only be the start of a major rebellion against Corbyn.To the Gang of Seven can be added three other moderate former Labour MPs who already sit as Independents, namely Frank Field, Ivan Lewis and John Woodcock, who describes Corbyn as “a clear risk to national security”.Public interest in the new group is strong. By early yesterday evening they had gained , followers on Twitter.And more Labour MPs are likely to resign, emboldened by the Gang Of Seven.  It should be remembered that in  no fewer than  Labour MPs —  per cent of the parliamentary party — openly declared their lack of confidence in Corbyn’s leadership.Tellingly, Tom Watson, the Deputy Leader, said in a bitter swipe at Corbyn yesterday that he “no longer recognised” his own party and merely condemned the defections as “premature”.Even with its modest beginnings, the Independent Group launch represents the biggest split in British politics since the formation of the SDP in , when Labour was lurching to the Left under Michael Foot. But the parallel with the SDP also highlights the weakness of the new group.The SDP was headed by the big figures of Roy Jenkins, David Owen and Shirley Williams, all experienced Cabinet Ministers and potential premiers.There is no one remotely of that stature among the new Independents.Their most high-profile member, Umunna, briefly ran for the Labour leadership in  but withdrew at the first whf of media scrutiny.Nor does the Independent Group have a coherent set of policies beyond being anti-Corbyn and pro-EU.In contrast, the SDP had a clear stance in favour of Britain’s nuclear deterrent, Common Market membership and the market economy.The splitters’ claim to be standing up for democracy is also weakened by their reluctance to accept the result of the  EU referendum, the greatest democratic exercise in British political history. Indeed, in their Remoaner posturing, there is an unpleasant air of the narrow, metropolitan progressive elite about their operation so far.Nevertheless,they help to prevent the election of Corbyn, they will do a service to British politics, just as the SDP helped to halt the advance of Foot almost  years ago. If the new Independent Group is really to reshape the British political landscape, it will have to be far more than just a narrow, elitist breakaway from Labour.A burst of anti-Corbyn hype is not enough. To become an authentic third force that dominates the centre, it will have to attract MPs from other parties.That means taking over the increasingly moribund Lib Dems, now led by the ineffectual Sir Vince Cable.More importantly, it   requires winning over Left-inclined Tories and anti-Brexit MPs such as the noisy Anna Soubry and the former GP Sarah Wollaston.Gaining Conservative support was precisely what the SDP failed to do, ultimately dooming it to failure. Just one Tory MP, Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler, became a Social Democrat.Gang of Seven member Gavin Shuker said that Labour had “turned its back on the British public”.He is absolutely right — which is  why Corbyn’s mob must not be allowed near power. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The former deputy leader of Liverpool’s City Council triggered a national outcry in the s by setting an illegal budget and was blasted for sending redundancy notices by taxi to thousands of council workers.He was expelled and in the Labour wilderness for nearly three decades.He claimed in September he had been readmitted - but Labour sources said at the time he was not a member.

And you definitely wouldnt expect the name of the pub below this rational, sensible, definitely-not-pie-in-the-sky group. Its called... *cough*... The Unicorn. But sure enough, this out-of-place office in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, now has a link to the group of seven MPs who quit the Labour Party today. It was registered last month as the HQ of Gemini A Ltd, a company run by Labour MP Gavin Shuker - one of the gang of seven who declared independence this morning.  The MPs say the company, also registered last month, exists to support the work of their new breakaway group. Unusually, theres little  supporting them - for now. Their group is only registered through a private company - not as a formal political party through the Electoral Commission watchdog. That raised speculation earlier today about whether the group would, in its current form, have to declare all its donations from private backers. Under the law, inidual MPs have to declare donations over a certain amount - and so do the political parties they belong to.   But private companies do not. That raised the question of whether donors could remain anonymous by donating to Gemini A Ltd. Gemini A Ltd could then, the theory went, have its own staff and donate to the inidual MPs without the ultimate source of the cash being known. After the Mirrors enquiries, the Electoral Commission tonight said it had contacted the MPs to understand the structure of the Group. A spokesman for the Independent Group insisted this is only Day One and appeared to indicate the group could be registered as a full political party in future. Thatd be needed, in any case,the group wants to field candidates at the next election. Without being registered as a political party, the Independent Groups MPs could stand for Parliament - but they would have to just stick independent next to their name, with no logo or brand.   The group is talking to the Electoral Commission as soon as possible, and we are committed to following the rules that the Commission... set out, a spokesman for the MPs said. We expect the publication of guidance though the Electoral Commission, butnot we will publish it on our website, in the same way that political parties do. The Independent Group is not a political party, as was set out this morning. But we will be talking to the Electoral Commission to clary the rules as soon as possible. Being linked to a private company does not usually raise questions over transparency in itself. Other political parties, such as UKIP, use a private firm as a vehicle. Registering a new party means handing over a small fee of pound, drawing up a party constitution and a financial statement and nominating a leader and a treasurer.  An Electoral Commission spokesman said: “The Members of Parliament that are part of this group will continue to be required to report to the House of Commons any donations above pound, that they receive in their capacity as a ‘regulated donee’. We have contacted the Independent Group to understand the structure of the Group and any further obligations on them inidually or collectively to report donations.” It was not immediately clear why the firm was registered in Altrincham - which is  miles from Mr Shukers constituency in Luton, Bedfordshire, and home to Tory grandee Sir Graham Brady. Private companies sometimes have no physical presence at their registered office, which can simply be the HQ for that firms accountants, for example.

It is the most signicant split in British politics since the breakaway of the Social Democratic Party in the s. Chuka Umunna,LucianaBerger, Chris Leslie, Angela Smith, Gavin Shuker, Mike Gapes and Ann Coffey are among the MPs from the partys centrist wing who have been the loudest critics of Jeremy Corbyns leadership, his stance on Brexit and his handling of allegations of anti-Semitism. In a Statement of Independence, setting out their values and approach, they promised to pursue policies that are evidence-based, not led by ideology, taking a long-term perspective to the challenges of the st century in the national interest, rather than locked in the old politics of the th century in the parties interests. None of the current political parties in Westminster are fit to provide the leadership and direction needed by our country, they said. And they pledged: As an Independent Group we aim to recognise the value of healthy debate, show tolerance towards dferent opinions and seek to reach across outdated ides and build consensus to tackle Britains problems. What happens now    The MPs have said they will sit as Independents in the House of Commons. They will remain on the opposition side of the chamber next to their former Labour colleagues. At the moment they are just an informal group of MPs without a leader, staff or a formal party structure. They say they will make the decision whether or not to formalise their status later this week. If they want to become a political party they would need to register with the Electoral Commission. That means handing over a fee of pound, drawing up a party constitution and a financial statement and nominating a leader and a treasurer.  So far there are no plans for these MPs to call by-elections but, as they were elected on a Labour Party  and a Labour manesto they may face growing pressure to go back to their constituents. Angela Smith told Politics Live that her constituents were aware of her stance when she campaigned at the last election -including her Brexit stance and disagreements with the Labour leader. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said the MPs should have stayed and fought their corner within the party. He said: I think you have a responsibility to go back to the electorate. Who could join them  Chuka Umunna extended an invitation to MPs from other parties to join them. In a call on other MPs to quit their parties, MrUmunnasaid: You might come from a Labour background but you might come from other political traditions. Yes, its a dficult decision - make no mistake about that. He added: We invite you to leave your parties and help us forge a new consensus on a way forward for Britain. There are a number of Labour MPs who agree with this group and may have already considering leaving. Owen Smith, who stood against Jeremy Corbyn in  has not ruled out joining the group. Outspoken Jeremy Corbyn critic John Woodcock, who quit the party last year, praised those who had broken away but has, as yet, not said he would join them. He tweeted: It was inspiring and humbling to see my friends setting out why they are leaving the Labour Party to start something new. A sad day for them but the beginning of a time of great hope for all those of us who want our country and our politics to change. There are a number of other Labour MPs who are currently sitting as independents within the House of Commons with some suggesting Ivan Lewis could join the grouping. It is less likely that Frank Field, the long standing MP for Birkenhead, will join them with some indication that he wants to rejoin Labour.   Mr Umunna extended his invitation to MPs from across the political spectrum. He has a relationship through his campaigning against Brexit with Anna Soubry who has suffered threats of deselection and abuse for backing Remain. But so far she has not commented on whether she would be tempted to join. What does it mean for the Brexit votes   The short answer is very little. The seven MPs are staunch Remainers who have become serial rebels against the Labour Party.One of the main Remain groups The Peoples Vote campaign released a statement distancing themselves from the new project. A spokesman reiterated the campaigns cross-party nature saying: “We are not a political party, nor are we ever going to allow ourselves to be associated with just one faction of any political party. We are a campaign for aPeople’sVote. We are supported by a cross-party group of MPs, as well as by members of the public from all parties and of none. “Some MPs will have their own reasons for wanting to resign from a particular political party but, as a campaign, we are still working towards securing the support of the Labour front bench. What does it mean for Labours Brexit policy   This is a far more interesting question.On the one hand losing a group of rebellious MPs could just mean Jeremy Corbyn and Sir Keir Starmer can continue with a strategy of keeping all options on the table - including a Peoples Vote. But with a group of MPs seen as on the right of Labour having left, this may make it easier to separate the issue of loyalty to Corbyn and opposition to Brexit and allow more MPs to come out in favour of a second vote.Last week a group calling themselves Love Socialism, Hate Brexit met for the first time. This group included a number of shadow frontbenchers including Clive Lewis and others who are seen as loyal to the leadership.  Theresignationof seven Labour members of parliament means the party now has  MPs in the House of Commons -  down on the total won at the  general election. On Sunday Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell warned potential splitters that they risked handing the Tories power for a decade in reference to his opinion of the SDPs role in Margaret Thatchers election success. One of the biggest Labour-supporting have said a split party doesnt win elections but Unisons General Secretary Dave Prentis also said it was up to Jeremy Corbyn to reach out to MPs. UNISON general secretary Dave Prentissaid: “Working people need a Labour government but split parties don’t win elections. Labour’s overriding concern must be to look long at hard at the reasons why the MPs feel they are no longer able to stay in the party. GMB general secretary Tim Roache warned that it would be unforgivable for any of those MPs who left the party today were to stand against Labour MPs. He said: I gritted my teeth through the Blair era, when I disagreed with the Labour government on a host of issues. But I stayed in the party because Labour in power is always better than the alternative. It would be unforgivable now for those who have resigned to stand against good Labour candidates, risking a Tory government. Unites general secretary Len McCluskey, who is the closest union boss to the labour leader, said: It is what it is its a group of iniduals who have decided to go a dferent path from the  that they stood on just  months ago. He said there was a strong whf of hypocrisy here adding that they all received increased majorities not because of their own personal charisma but because of the Labour manesto.He added: History will judge them. If they regard themselves as democrats I wondertheyre going to stand down and create by-elections.Campaign group Momentum, which helped Jeremy Corbyns election as Labour leader, dismissed the breakaway groups politics as ato the politics of the past. And they poured scorn on the MPs ability to inspire the same grassroots response as Corbyns Labour. LauraParker, Momentum National Coordinator, said:With a back to the Blair years programme of privatisation, tax cuts for the rich and deregulation of the banks, they offer no concrete solutions, no new ideas and have no support amongst the public.Across Europe, parties stuck in the middle of the road mould have no young supporter base to speak of and are plummeting in the polls, enabling the rise of the far right. Tens of thousands of volunteers regularly come out and campaign for Labour. This fringe minority of MPs have today not set out any agenda capable of inspiring anything remotely similar.” What does it mean for Jeremy Corbyn   The seven MPs quitting means Jeremy Corbyn is finally rid of a group of MPs who have been a thorn in his side and openly hostile to him since he became leader. But a lot will depend on how the Labour reacts to the departures. The Labour leader have so far expressed his disappointment and talked about bringing people together. He said in a statement: I am disappointed that these MPs have felt unable to continue to work together for the Labour policies that inspired millions at the last election and saw us increase our vote by the largest share since . Labour won people over on a programme for the many not the few – redistributing wealth and power, taking vital resources into public ownership, investing in every region and nation, and tackling climate change.The Tories are bungling Brexit while Labour has set out a unying and credible alternative plan. When millions face the misery of Universal Credit , rising crime, homelessness and poverty, now more than ever is the time to bring people together to build a better future for us all."},{"url":null,"title":"shamima begum tory mp demands","story":"NewsShamima Begum: Tory MP demands law of TREASON is restored over Brit ISIS brideJulian Lewis suggested the law should be brought back to deal with those who joined Islamic StateShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical CorrespondentDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video tory-mp-demands-law-treason-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTory MP Julian Lewis called for Parliament to restore the law of treason in an attempt to deal with those ing to the UK from the so-called Islamic State. He added it should specy that it is treason to support a group that one knows intends to attack the UK or is fighting UK forces. The dilemma for the UK in how to treat British mum Shemima Begum has thrown the wider issue of responding the ing jihadists into sharp relief. Ms Begum left Bethnal Green in London when she was  to join the Islamic State group in Syria. Dr Lewis told MPs: Though the law on treason is antiquated the act of treason most certainly is not. He added: Its quite obvious that therell be many people coming back whom it will not be possible to establish by normal standards in a court of law that they committed crimes whilst volunteering and spending time in the so-called Caliphate.  He argued that the government could resurrect the law of treason to tackle such cases citing an article by Oxford Professor Richard Ekins in the Sunday . He argued that such a statute could be used to specy it is treason to support a group that one knows intends to attack the UK or is fighting UK forces. Home Secretary Sajid Javid did not rule out bringing back the law which He said: This is a complex situation and we should always be looking to see what tools that we have at our disposal to ensure that those who are guilty of terrorism and supporting terrorist groups are brought to justice and that means making sure that we have the right laws in place. He added that he had read the article that Mr Lewis referred to and had heard what the Professor said in the past. The last treason trial was that of William Joyce, Lord Haw-Haw who broadcast Nazi propaganda to Britain from Germany during the Second World War and who was executed by hanging in .  Dr Lewiss comments came after Home Secretary Sajid Javid warned Ms Begum: If you back terror, there must be consequences. Mr Javid warned  dangerous Brits with dual nationality have already been stripped of their UK citizenship to prevent their . But he said he could only take this movejihadis have dual citizenship - notthey have UK citizenship alone. Mr Javid did not confirmMs Begum can be permanently excluded - saying he was not at liberty to discuss the inidual case. However, he said: Whatever role they took in the so-called caliphate, they all supported a terrorist organisation and in doing so they have shown they hate our country and the values we stand for. This is a death cult that enslaved and raped thousands of Yazidi girls and that celebrated attacks on our shores including the tragic Manchester bombing that targeted young girls. Now that this so-called caliphate is crumbling, some of them want to . And I have been very clear where I can and where any threat remains I will not hesitate to prevent this.   The Home Secretary said in recent years,  people went to Syria or Iraq to join terrorist organisations. Of those he said % were killed in the battlefield, % ed and % are still somewhere in the region. Tory MPs piled on the Home Secretary to demand stronger action. Conservative former minister Sir Desmond Swayne suggested internment for ing jihadi supporters until theyve been sufficiently quarantined.Tory MP Philip Hollobone said just  British nationals have been prosecuted for supporting IS - also referred to as Daesh - inSyriaand Iraq, telling Mr Javid: This simply isnt good enough.But some urged caution with the governments response. Tory ex-minister Andrew Mitchell told the House of Commons: We cannot just close our eyes and pull up the drawbridge.And SNP MP Gavin Newlands said the UK has a responsibility to Ms Begum, who he said was thought to be the victim of a grooming campaign.He added: Shes a vulnerable young woman with a newborn child and the government should follow international law, allow her toto face the consequences of her actions. Mr Javid refused to comment on the inidual case, but replied: Our first priority, is to protect this country and do whatever is necessary.

What happens next is crucial, more Labour MPs ripping up party cards to join what is calling itself an Independent Group would be another gt for the Conservatives. Labour should first consider why the seven departed to avoid others following, addressing grievances on Europe and anti-Semitism in the hope of uniting the party. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell’s call for MPs to stand again in by-elections, now they’re against the party which got them into Parliament, is, alas, likely to be rejected.   The prospect of a Labour government is a little more remote today and the Tories a little more secure as a result of the split. Surely that can’t be good for working people.

The split in  continues to cast a dark shadow over the party. Then, as now, a group of moderate MPs left in protest at the party’s shyleadership, the infiltration by the hard left and isions over Europe. Then, as now, the splitters promised to break the mould by changing the “broken” way of doing politics. In the end they only proved the dficulties of establishing a new political force under our first-past-the-post electoral system. In , the SDP-Liberal Alliance got . million votes, a shade below Labour’s . million, but won  seats to Michael Foot’s . By , the SDP was wound up following the creation of the Liberal Democrats.  Many in Labour fear history could repeat itself with the “gang of seven”. The lesson they draw from the creation of the SDP is that a new party will split the Labour vote and hand the Tories the next general election on a plate. Angela Smith said yesterday that comparisons with the SDP do not “stand up to scrutiny”.  “This is a dferent century and the challenges that the country faces are on a scale that I don’t think we have seen at any other time in the post-war period,” she said. There is no doubt that Brexit is testing traditional political allegiances. Many voters now identy themselves by how they voted in the referendum, rather than by which party they tend to support.  But it is far from certain this upheaval will lead to a redrawing of the political map. Historian Dr Matt Cole, from Birmingham University, said: “The inidual MPs have a steep hill to climb, it is rarely successful. “The culture of British politics is one in which the main political parties, however unpopular they are, nonetheless are incredibly resilient. “They are like a company that nobody likes the products of, but they can’t stop buying them.” The two main parties’ joint vote in  was the highest since , he said. There may be, as Ms Smith said, a large number of people who feel politically homeless. But evenyou provide then with a new house the chances of breaking the two-party monopoly are slim.  Unlike in , the seven dissident MPs cannot claim to be political heavyweights. The founders of the SDP included Roy Jenkins, a former Chancellor and Home Secretary, David Owen, a former Foreign shySecretary, and Shirley Williams, a former Education Secretary. The highest rank achieved by Chuka Ummuna was shadow Business Secretary under Ed Miliband. At the moment, the Independent Group lacks all the components required to form a new party – a grassroots base, money and a distinct agenda. The MPs were brutally honest in saying what they were against: the failure to tackle anti-Semitism the hard Left’s grip on the party machine the lukewarm opposition to Brexit.  They were less clear when it came to spelling out what they did stand for. But this does not mean the Labour leadership has nothing to fear from the breakaway. The centrist seven could be joined by other MPs, including Conservatives, and their message may shyresonate with disillusioned Labour councillors, activists and voters. Which is why many expected a stronger response from the Labour leadership to the most serious fracturing of the party in almost  years. It was moment when the party’s MPs and activists looked for reassurance and direction. Instead, Mr Corbyn issued a tersely worded statement expressing his disappointment and sent an email to members urging them to stay united.  There should have been, at the very least, an acknowledgement that the criticisms made by the departing seven would have chimed with many Labour MPs and supporters. Those who may still quit need to hear from the Labour leader why they should stay. It was left to Deputy Leader Tom Watson to try to articulate the mood of a dismayed and anxious party. His warning that unless things change others could follow the seven out of the door was a direct challenge to Corbyn. Labour could only prevent others from leaving, Watson said,we “reach out and extend beyond our comfort zone”.  There was also a more veiled message that the leadership needed to listen to the Parliamentary Labour Party on Brexit. It was noticeable that in his email to party members, Mr Corbyn reaffirmed that the option of a second referendum remained on the table. Some believe that unless he follows through on this demand then other MPs could join the nascent Independent Group. How the leadership responds will be a major factor in determining whether the breakaway MPs are a flash in the pan or a new movement. If allies of Corbyn turn viciously on the quitters they will confirm their reasons for leaving and could encourage others to follow.  The leadership must ask itself why moderate MPs feel they can no longer stay in the party and respond to concerns about Brexit and anti-Semitism. At stake is Labour’s chance of winning the next election. In dozens of marginal seats the Independent Group could split the opposition vote and allow the Tories to keep power. The legacy of the SDP was to force Labour to sht to the centre, where elections are usually won or lost. Today’s seven MPs may have decided to sacrice their careers for the same ambition.

It’s posh and full of snobs.”So that evening I mentioned this to the audience, and a woman shouted, “It’s true, they are posh – they’ve even got theirown dentist.”Incidents like this led to the Radio  show Mark Steel’s in Town, in which I visit a town each week and write a show about it, performed to a local audience. This is why I’ve encountered attractions such as Hebden Bridge, the scenic Yorkshire town so famous for its lesbian community that the manager of the tourist office told me a woman came in that week, striding past brochures for coach trips and rambles, and said, “I’ve heard this town is full of lesbians, so I want you to find me one.”  A few miles away, the people of Stockport are immensely proud of the  night bus route, on which they insist every journey entertains you. One discussion went, “Does that bloke still get on with no shirt, always carrying a rabbit ” – “Of course he does, he’s the driver.” Stockport also shyexperienced a plague of wild peacocks. No one knew where they’d come from, but they were sat on cars, screeching on fences, and the local paper quoted one woman saying, “It was terrying. One came into the kitchen and knocked over a kettle.” In nearby upmarket Wilmslow, Cheshire, where soap stars and Manchester United footballers live, I found a leaflet in an estate agents, advertising a bungalow for poundmillion, which said: “This bungalow boasts one feature not found in any other bungalow in the area: it has an extra floor.”Sometimes it feels asthe area puts on a show on purpose. When I visited shyBirkenhead, Merseyside, someone suggested I go to a local bar called Moodz. It was a long thin room, brightly lit, with a dozen people drinking on their own, facing forwards and scowling, while one man rode up and down in a mobility scooter. Then Come on Eileen by Dexys Midnight Runners came on the jukebox, and a woman of about  stood on a table and sang along to it very loudly. The man in the mobility scooter stripped down to his pants, then stood up, trying to dance while clinging to the bar. The woman came down from the table, whipped off his pants, they sang “too-ra-oo-ra-ay”, while no one  took the slightest bit of notice. The producer of the radio show nudged me and said, “And it’s only half past seven.”  Almost every town has a rich tradition of protest. So everyone in Walsall, West Mids, seems to know Sister Dora – the Victorian nurse who transformed hospitals by campaigning for them to be kept clean – who has a statue in the town centre. And all of Hull knows Lily Bilocca, the woman who led the campaign for safety laws on trawlers, whose face is on a vast mural by the docks. But in the genteel Durham town of Barnard Castle, there was fury because British Telecom installed a small green box on a pavement. One woman said: “I was delivering the church newsletter and wasn’t looking where I was going so I nearly walked into it.” But they were determined to resist. The local paper reported: “A group of knitters are threatening to produce a tea cosy to cover up the cabinet... However, having considered their tea cosy protest, fear of getting into trouble with the authorities is making them think twice.” It’s like reading about the struggles of Nelson Mandela.  Some of the proudest areas are just outside cities. Don’t suggest to someone from Paisley they’re a part of Glasgow. You’ll face abuse that goes, “We’re nowhere near Glasgow, we’re at least two miles from Glasgow, I don’t even know how I know it’s two miles away as I’ve never heard of Glasgow.” In a pub in Paisley I was told of the time a dog’s jaws locked around a man’s testicles. The police were called but action was required urgently, so a passer-by whacked the dog with a baseball bat. Later the police said: “It was lucky this happened in Paisley, as it’s the only place you can shyguarantee there’ll be a passer-by with a baseball bat.” On the surface, modern Britain looks increasingly unorm and soulless. Every town has its shyidentical shypedestrianised precinct, Tesco Expresses, and out-of-town retail parks with Homebase and identical staff and pot-plants. But in Portishead, the shypersonality they asked to turn on the Christmas lights was Nigel who worked in Homebase, “chosen above TV stars, for his cheerful demeanour and helpful attitude”. By the end of the series, I’ll have been to  towns, and every one has been packed with enthusiastic people who adore their town, because each place is ridiculously gloriously dferent. Because it’s only in Hastings that businesses can have names such as “ waxing for men”, and a builder called “William the Concreter”.Mark Steel’s In Town, Radio , Thursday, .pm.

Christopher Finch, , said the tat is so dire it will cost thousands to repair and that no legitimate artist will touch his “car crash of a tattoo”. Mr Finch, from Plymstock, Plymouth, said he wanted to get the skull and cross bones on his upper arm covered with an image of the Grim Reaper. His mum put him in touch with a man she knew who claimed to have “ years experience”.He took her word for it and arranged for the supposedly qualied tattooist to come and get him inked, reports Plymouth Live.However, it turned out the man, who since disappeared, was a barely qualied apprentice at a local tattoo joint, and despite spending nearly five hours working on Mr Finch’s arm, the results were disastrous.   He left after telling Mr Finch he’d be back to finish the job, but is now AWOL. Mr Finch said: He said he had  years experience in tattooing I let him come to my familys address. I genuinely thought he was legit. I let him do the job, I gave him pound upfront and he buggered off and hes left me with that. I spoke to the shop where he was supposed to be from and they said he wasnt supposed to be doing this, he was only an apprentice. The amount of complaints this guy has had is unbelievable.

The actor, , describes the comedy – which ed for a charity special in  – as “of its time” and jokes: “These days, it’d have to be People of No Particular Gender Behaving Badly.” Tongue-in-cheekness aside, he adds that a pilot for the show was so “s***” that the laddish comedy almost never saw the light of day. Fawlty Towers director John Howard Davies steered the initial episode, and Martin says he was instructed to “be more like John Cleese.”  He adds: “They kept saying, ‘They’ve got to be chalk and cheese, these two. Gary and Tony have got to keep arguing.’” “That pilot never got shown,” he continues to Radio Times. “We remade it – andyou look at the way the show went, it was completely the opposite. “Gary forgave Tony for sleeping with his girlfriend, that’s how close they were – and that’s why it was funny. But at the time there were these very rigid ideas, and I think that’s what killed sitcoms.” Funny that… Martin stars in a new one, Warren, on BBC from Monday.

Jenna Johnson died on January  however her family believe that the horric ordeal days earlier was the catalyst. The -year-olds body was found at her home in Thurso, Scotland after she failed to join her family for lunch at her mum’s house. Jenna was said to have been tormented by the thought of people in her home town finding out about the assault, report the Daily Record. After Jenna’s body was found, it was taken to Glasgow for a forensic examination. But tests were inconclusive because the sexual assault by two men happened days earlier, on the night of December  or early hours of December . Jenna told close friends and her little sister Ky the shyidentities of the two men who drove her to kill herself. Now her family wants justice.  And Ky and mum Carol Forrest have reached out to another Caithness family still demanding justice after more than five years. One of the men Jenna accused of rape is suspected locally to have murdered Stefan Sutherland, , in September , and to have got away with it. Police and the Crown Office continue to claim there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding Stefan’s death, despite a catalogue of evidence to the contrary. Stefan vanished after a night out in Lybster, Caithness, on September , . His body was found on the beach at nearby Occumster on September .  His blood was found on the walls of the suspect’s home and he had injuries consistent with being tortured when he was found. Carol said: “We know, and our whole community knows, that these two guys are evil and have carried out other sickening and violent crimes. “Stefan’s killer is the shyringleader. He thinks he is above the law and is a very dangerous man. He needs to be locked up or there will be more deaths.” Stefan’s dad Sandy said: “This guy should have been in jail for Stefan’s murder andhe had been, another family would not be suffering as we have.”  About a week before she died, Jenna had woken to find herself covered in bruises and scratches, with needle marks in one arm. As her head cleared, she recalled being seriously shysexually assaulted by one man and raped by another. The two told her they had filmed the attack and shythreatened to publish the video, taunting her that it would lead to the loss of her children. She showed Ky, , her arms after the assault.  Ky said: “One arm had needle marks and the other was covered in scrapes and bruises that looked like they had been made by fingers holding her down. “She didn’t tell me the full story but she told me who she had been with and I knew one of them was considered a murderer in our community. “She said she must have been drugged as she couldn’t remember clearly all that had happened. “I was actually angry at her for associating with them. “Over the Christmas period, she was subdued and quiet. But on Hogmanay, she brightened up, ordered a shymicrowave, things for the kids, shyornaments, candles and we talked about taking a winter trip together to Iceland and a summer holiday in New York.”  Carol added: “Jenna was not suicidal when she left her kids with me on Hogmanay. “Who orders things for their home and plans holidays when they intend to end their le  “In the morning, when I texted, ‘Happy New Year’ and she never replied, I got a bad feeling. She was coming to me to eat but she didn’t show and there was no sign of her on Facebook.” Worried, she called the police and two officers went with her and broke into Jenna’s flat, finding her dead inside. Later that day, Carol and Ky heard a full account of what Jenna had apparently gone through from friends. Ky said: “It seemed a few people in the community knew these two guys had drugged and raped her and filmed it, because they had actually been boasting about it. “They told Jenna they had filmed themselves doing sexual things to her and were shythreatening to send it to people, saying she’d lose her kids. “I don’t knowthey were blackmailing her or just enjoying having power over her but she was distraught. “Jenna was a loyal friend and totally devoted to her kids. “The thought of losing them would have been too much for her.” Her mum added: “I’m so angry with both these men. One is the ringleader and nothing about him surprises anyone who knows him but Jenna trusted the other one as a friend and he betrayed her.” The family has been told Jenna was drinking with the men when they turned on her, held her down and injected her with a sedative. Breaking down, Ky recounted how Jenna described the rape. She said: “We have told the police and the people she confided in have also made statements identying the men who did this, and they are both well known to the police. “We have no ideathey have been shyquestioned but we have been told that no video footage has been found and that they have been unable to access Jenna’s phone because it had a passcode. “Police told us it could cost pound to have an expert bypass the security and they would have to justy the cost to their bosses. “My sister was raped, threatened with public humiliation and I don’t know what  and she has killed herself as a result. “I don’t think you can put a price on doing everything possible to gather evidence to deliver justice.” Carol added: “The police appeared at first to want to push as hard as they could. “But we feel that it’s already been downgraded. There should be no argument about the phone being examined, no matter the cost. “Jenna was out with friends at a house party after leaving me on New Year’s Eve. They all say she was in good form. “She got a phone call and became agitated, but didn’t say who called or what it was about. “A text followed and her mood got even worse. When her friends moved on to another party, she wanted to go home. “She called me at about .am and told me to tell her kids she really loved them. I was half asleep and thinking she could tell them herself when she came for her dinner. “I didn’t realise there was anything major wrong and that it would be the last time we spoke. “The most important thing I can do now for my daughter is look after her children. “But I can also demand justice. She doesn’t have a voice any more so we have to speak for her. Too many serious and violent crimes have been swept under the carpet in this area in recent years. “Ky and I need to make sure this isn’t another one. “We want people to know how Jenna died and to know that eventhe men who raped and threatened her didn’t kill her with their own hands, they are responsible. “We won’t be fobbed off and we won’t stay quiet. “I had to bury my daughter two weeks after her th birthday. Our lives will never be the same. We are devastated. “Yet they remain free to walk around and choose their next victim.” Police said there were no shysuspicious circumstances surrounding Jenna’s death but refused to give further comment as there was an “ongoing investigation”.

Michael Folan was due to stand trial after throwing chairs and tables at cars and members of the public outside The Cherry Tree public house on John William Street in Huddersfield. The -year-old was almost hit by a bus as he dragged metal poles belonging to the premises into the road and flung them at passing traffic. He was due to stand trial at Kirklees Magistrates Court over the October  incident. But he was excluded by court security after hurling abuse at female court workers and pulling down his trousers in front of them. Prosecutor Lydia Pearce said that Folans bizarre rampage kicked off at .am.  She told magistrates: “The defendant was outside the Wetherspoons and picked up the barriers and swung them around in the street, causing alarm and distress to members of the public. “He picked up ashtrays and tables and threw them at people and vehicles. “Then he picked up chairs and threw them into the road, causing disruption. “He was shouting and swearing and members of the public were caused to fear the defendant and that they would be subjected to violence.” Fiona Louhunane who works in the building next to the pub was heading for her lunch break when she saw the commotion outside.  She told magistrates: “I became aware that articles were being thrown around in the street. They were heavy metal poles that support the cordon around the pub. “They were being thrown about by a person I know to be Mick Folan. He was very erratic and unpredictable as he moved around. “There were a lot of pedestrians - old people and people with pushchairs - about and I was quite concerned that somebody was going to get badly hurt. “He threw chairs at taxis and jumped into the road in front of traffic and a bus. “I was worried for other people because the tables and poles are metal and heavy.” Ms Louhunane said that she went into the pub to alert staff and dialled . She told the court that Folan was known locally as Mad Mick and she had previously helped him off the floor and moved him to a safe place. Another witness, Philip Harling, saw what happened as he waited for his we in his car parked up opposite the pub. He said: “He was waving his arms around and being abusive. He got hold of the metal pole and threw it into the middle of the road. He then threw another one then the third one which tripped him up. “He was in the middle of the road and shouting very abusively, shouting f****g this and f****g that. “I was frightened that my car would get hit by the ashtrays he was throwing. I was concerned for members of the public and that my we would get caught up in it. “Two members of the public detained him on the floor and I called . A police officer called to the scene following reports of Folan causing havoc said that he was obstructive as he detained and arrested him.Folan had pleaded not guilty to a charge of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear of immediate unlawful violence. His trial then went ahead in his absence following his exclusion from the court building.Folan, a well-known offender with alcohol and mental health dficulties, made derogatory comments about female members of court staff and pulled down his trousers to expose his genitals inside one of the courtrooms. Ms Pearce commented: “Hes made himself unavailable by the course of his actions, including dropping his trousers. “These actions have led to him being excluded by staff today.” Finding him guilty of the offence magistrates concluded that Folan, of Bradley Mills Lane in Dalton, would have put members of the public in fear of their safety with his threatening and abusive behaviour.

Deal, an aspiring rapper whose stage name is JAYD, told her he was going to audition for BGT with a song he wrote dedicated to his love for her. His infatuation culminated in him following her to the finals of Miss England in Nottingham where he tried to kiss her as she came off stage.   Ms Bumford, , said she was forced to shove him away and flee towards her family. Feeling spurned, Deal later sent her a message claiming you only did well in Miss England because the judges thought you were my girlfriend.

He has troubles forming relationships and no one in the past has seemed to get to the root of the issue. In jailing him, magistrate Marion Mackay said: The impact you have had on the victim has been very serious and you have had an impact on her mental state. As there is a history of similar offences we think the incident is serious enough to warrant a custodial sentence. You will also be handed a restraining order running indefinitely.

Christopher Daniel abused a six-year-old girl for two years - yet he was let off with no criminal record.A part-time sherf appeared to blame his immaturity and social awkwardness for his behaviour, referring to Daniel as naive.Daniel was given an absolute discharge, and Sherf Gerard Sinclairs reasoning behind his decision was released in a highly unusual move on Thursday. A Justice Office for Scotland statement said any recorded conviction for the offence would have serious consequences in terms of the accuseds future career as a dentist, the Daily Record reports.The move has caused a furious backlash from the childs family and the thousands who put their name to the petition within hours of its launch. Marisa Keegan started the petition on Friday calling for Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf to review the case. On the petition page, she wrote: Our system is putting criminals careers before our childrens welfare.

The accused had appeared both noticeably immature and socially awkward, features confirmed by other evidence in the case. It was fortunate that the complainer appeared to have suffered no injury or long lasting effects. It said any recorded conviction for the offence would have serious consequences in terms of the accuseds future career and any sentence would mean Daniel would probably be unable to continue his university course. But the mum of Daniel’s victim said she was “gobsmacked” by the decision to grant her attacker an absolute discharge at Dumbarton Sherf Court – meaning the student does not have a criminal record and was not put on the sex offenders’ register. She said: “We don’t want him locked up but he should be put on the sex offenders’ register. “As we suspected, the sherf also confirms his career was deemed to be more important. Sohe had not done as well in his exams at school, he would have been put on the sex offenders’ register ”  Conservative MSP Liam Kerr raised the case at First Ministers Questions on Thursday, telling Nicola Sturgeon the sherfs decision had devastated the victims family. Ms Sturgeon said: I absolutely understand the concerns that have been expressed about what has been reported about this sentence, but the sentencing decision in any criminal case is entirely a matter for the judge. The judiciary acts entirely independently on the basis of the facts and circumstances of inidual cases.They will take into account a wide range of factors, including the age of the offender and any previous convictions. I understand the concerns, but we must protect the principle in this country that sentencing decisions are not a matter for politicians, however controversial and dficult they can be for the public.Sentencing decisions are rightly and properly matters for judges.

The pound, boob job has made Lauren’s confidence “sky rocket”, she said.Speaking to Gazette Live , Lauren told of how one of her boobs used to be an A cup and the other was a C cup.Doctors promised Lauren her breasts would even out but they never did and people made hurtful comments about her asymmetrical breasts when she wore tight clothing. Its possibly the best thing I’ve done so far in my personal le, said the Teesside University student. It has changed my le an unbelievable amount.   “Ever since the age of  I’ve wanted breast surgery to change the way I looked and to provide me with more body confidence.” She continued: “I take a lot of pride in my appearance so when I looked in the mirror, I wanted to feel confident and comfortable in what I saw and for years I didn’t like what was looking back at me. “No amount of make-up made any dference to alter my mood as in my mind it was my body that was the problem. It was Laurens grandma Jean Watson who first suggested she go private. “My grandma has been amazing she even went with me for my first consultation. I couldn’t have done this without her help, said Lauren, who lives in Hartlepool. Jean lent her granddaughter the pound, for the surgery and Lauren is paying her back monthly. Lauren, who also works as a retail assistant, got smaller implants in the bigger breast and bigger implants in my smaller breast, and an uplt in the larger one.   She tried a number of sizes against each breast until herself and consultant cosmetic surgeon Christopher Dunkin at Nuffield Health Tees Hospital were happy they would sit quite evenly. Since the operation at Nuffield Health the contrast in my emotions has been immeasurable, she said. “For me the most important thing is my confidence and how I express that through my fashion because it is something I love. “I love that I have no limits now and I don’t have that voice in the back of my mind saying I can’t wear something because it won’t suit me. Or, it won’t look good on me because now I can wear anything and I truly feel amazing because of it.  About  per cent of women are thought to sort of breast size asymmetry. Breasts can grow with dferent amounts of fatty tissue, which becomes apparent in puberty. Mr Dunkin said breasts are an important part of body confidence for women. Most women have a slight dference between their breasts. But when they are completely dferent it can be very distressing, he said.

However, one mum-to-be recently made an adorable faux pas which is a new one on us. Lori Farrell headed to work dressed in what she believed to be a smart, stripy maternity skirt. It was only when she later Googled the brand that the penny dropped. Looks nice, doesnt it   Except, despite having extra material to allow for a growing bump, this wasnt a maternity skirt. Not even close. Instead, Lori was proudly sporting a baby car seat cover. The brand responsible for the car seat cover seat, Itzy Ritzy, werent the only ones who found it very funny. Speaking to Motherly , Lori explained:  A friend of mine had given me a huge lot of baby stuff, from clothes to baby carriers to a rocker and blankets and when I pulled it out I was not sure what it was. I debated it but washed it anyway then decided because of the way it pulled on the side it must be a maternity skirt.  When I got to work I googled the brand and realised not only do they not sell clothing but it was a car seat cover. As the responses show, Lori is not alone in making this sort of error.   I once let my husband borrow what I thought was a warm headband for a chilly outdoor event. Turns out he wore my black tube bra, added one woman. And Loris accidental re-purposing has also won her fans. Um this makes you a genius, added another. Any mom who can make multiple uses out of things before and after babies is a win.

And I will pack it in the lunch box again the next day, he told Mamamia .If you don’t repeat a food, the child will never get used to it. According to Stone its important to be firm. Oh, and forget about giving them a choice. The other thing is to not give them an option,Stone adds.  With us, when the kids get home from school, I always have a snack sitting out, like oranges.

Now current owners David Hunt and his mother Diana claim that the house is occupied by its previous occupants and that sometimes they can feel many eyes watching them in the property.David is so certain that the ghosts exist that each morning he enters the house and says: Good morning everyone.Now the pair have now put the property up for sale, hoping that someone canit to its former glory. He said: Sometimes you stand here and just feel that there are people around you, watching you - in a nice way. Its not nasty, you know. We speak to them.   When David and his mother, Diana, bought the farmhouse back in  it was in a dilapidated state and had been vacant since the late sixties. Their plan had always been to renovate the large manor house and move into it, but now they have decided to sell the property. David added: For some reason Ive ended up buying a lot of haunted houses. Ive renovated  properties. You come to realise when you start doing the work, you disturb the energies of the house, and whatever is there appears. Now, whether thats just me - and I dont think it is because Ive had a lot of other people say that - you just change the energies of the house.  Andthere are legends of ghosts, they tend to show themselves. Renovations that have been completed were done by David, and he said that during the work he made a series of fascinating discoveries. Whilst digging up earth at the side of the house one day, he discovered remains of a whole room that had been buried for at least a century. Within the rubble of part of the house that collapsed decades ago, David found the remains of an exquisite parquetry ceiling. He later found out that this ceiling was part of the houses library, when a woman who once lived in the house came to visit, and explained the layout of the Great Hall.   Several years ago, David says he met a travelling psychic who told him about the houses other-worldly residents. David says the man spoke a lot about the Civil War and how at the time soldiers would have shouted Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. This expression shocked David, as another medium visited the house and said she spoke to a spirit who had once lived there who said: Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. One historical account of a death in the house is found in a manuscript by former resident Alfred Chapman. He wrote down some of his family history after he emigrated to America in .  In it, Alfred writes about his sister, who was managing Upcott Barton when she died in , aged . He wrote: Mary Anne was a beautul, healthy looking young lady and was as good as she looked. The day before she died she appeared to be in perfect health except for a swelling in front of her throat which never appeared to trouble or inconvenience her except in its appearance. She died suddenly in the early morning. My brother George and I slept in a room adjoining sisters bedroom. Sometime in the morning before daylight I heard a scream and a noise like someone falling on the floor of my sisters room. It awoke me and I immediately jumped out of bed and ran into my sisters bedroom where I found Mary Anne on the floor and Elizabeth in bed holding on to Mary Annes hand trying to pull her in bed.   Elizabeth had been sound asleep also before the scream and fall, which awoke her. We lted Mary Anne in bed and she died in our arms without saying a word. The historically signicant Grade II Listed farmhouse is now on the market with planning permission - and a guide price of pound,. It is being sold by Stags estate agents. A spokesperson said: This Former Farmhouse is believed to date from the late medieval period with th century alterations. Now in a derelict state, plans have been drawn to create an exceptionally spacious distinctive four five bedroom residence retaining many character features.

The lion toy was purchased for  on February  from a branch of Kmart in Melbourne, Australia, along with several other animal toys, including an elephant and a hippo.According to Mrs Husnu, a professional blogger, the other animals do not feature any obvious genitalia.The concerned parent toldshe bought the toys for a trip to the local zoo. She said: We were planning a trip to the zoo and I thought it would be really greatthe kids could take some animal toys with them on the day.

The woman in her s, from Guiyang, China refused to accept she was giving birth after being brought in to a hospital with abdominal pains. Doctors say that the educated woman, who was excessively overweight , had not noticed that she was pregnant because of her size. They added that she was genuinely surprised that she had ended up with a baby when hospital staff told her. She then complicated matters by insisting medics carry out a virginity test first before carrying out a C-section. The incident happened at a hospital in Guiyang, capital of Guizhou Province, according to Guiyang Evening Post on February .  The woman ended up in the hospitals emergency department after she was helped there by her parents and medics were stunned to learn that she was completely oblivious to the fact that she had started contractions - and was now going into labour. When the obstetrician broke the news, the patient in her s reportedly said: Impossible. Its not possible that Im pregnant!   The physician, who declined to be named in the report, said: She demanded that we perform a virginity test on her. It was very frustrating. According to hospital staff, the woman was adamant she could not be pregnant because she doesnt like men and has never had a boyfriend, much less sex. When her doctor asked whether it could have happened during some sort of drunken blackout, the patient claimed she was allergic to alcohol and doesnt touch booze. Medics suggested the woman was overweight, with her physique apparently masking the fact that a child had been growing in her womb for nine months. There was nothing more we could say to convince her that she was going into labour, the doctor said.   The hospital agreed to perform an emergency C-section on the woman and she gave birth to a baby boy on February , the second day of the new lunar year. However, the newborn was handed to the womans parents after she refused to nurse him. According to reports, the woman lives alone and, because of her weight and irregular menstrual cycle, never noticed she was pregnant. None of her friends noticed either. The hospitals head of obstetrics said: Its not the first time weve had a mother who only realised she was pregnant right before giving birth. They are usually underage and lacking in knowledge about their physiology. But this patient is in her s and was educated, so were particularly surprised. The report did not say whether the patient planned to give her son up for adoption. It is currently unclear who fathered the child.

In an interview with the BBC, Shamima Begum, now , said the deaths of  innocent people in the terrorist attack on an Ariana Grande concert in  were akin to the women and children being bombed in IS territory in Baghuz.She told the broadcaster: I do feel that its wrong that innocent people did get killed. Its one thing to kill a soldier that is fighting you, its self-defence, but to kill the people like women and children... Just people like the women and children in Baghuz that are being killed right now unjustly, the bombings. Its a two-way thing really.  Because women and children are being killed back in the Islamic State right now and its kind of retaliation. Like, their justication was that it was retaliation so I thought OK, that is a fair justication.The mother-of-three, who gave birth to her third child at the weekend, left east London with two friends in  to join the terrorist group. She was partly inspired by videos of fighters beheading hostages and partly by other propaganda films showing the good le IS could offer.  Since she has been there, she has had three children, two of whom - a boy and a girl - died in infancy.She gave birth to a boy on Saturday who she has named Jarrah .The teenager insisted she did not ask to be the subject of international media attention. She said: I didnt want to be on the news at first. I know a lot of people, after they saw that me and my friends came, it actually encouraged them.

Shes been there for four years and we would be surprisedshe hadnt been further damaged beyond the degree she had already been groomed into.

Now it’s a question of getting settled in as quick as I can and just playing football,” he said.“I had obviously spoken to Derek McInnes and he said to speak to Jim McIntyre before making any decision.“The gaffer at Aberdeen left it up to me.“He told me he’d love to have me still up there butI wanted to go and get games he understood.“So I spoke to the gaffer here on the phone and I loved everything he had to say. I jumped at the chance to come down here.”And the -year-old sees the draws against Hamilton and Kilmarnock since he arrived as proof this is a squad that can pull away from the relegation zone between now and the end of the season.“The only frustrating thing for me so far is that we’ve not taken six points out of six from the two games I’ve been involved in but I think all the fans and us as a team can feel from those performances that we are building momentum.“In the Hamilton game it was a case of everyone trying to get used to each other. A lot of us had only come in right before the deadline and we only really had one training session together.“It was about trying to get to know everyone’s games, their personalities. I think we are all starting to gel now and you can see that on the pitch.“Not having a game last weekend because we’re out of the cup has given us a bit more time to work on that. That gives us a better picture going into the game against Livingston this weekend.”Today’s trip to the Tony Macaroni Arena to face Livingston is a meeting with a team who have taken the Premiership by storm this term but have been struggling for a win of late.Since thumping Hearts - in mid-December, Gary Holt’s team have not won in eight outings. Wright does not see that as a sign this could be an easy  minutes for Dundee.“We have to treat it that every game from now on is going to be a big game for us and this will be.“We know how Livi will be and they will work hard but all we can do is just prepare the way we want to and work on how we can play. Hopefully, that will be enough.“They haven’t won in a few games but it’s a testimony to Livi how many points they have. They started the season so well.”Today, of course, will see Dundee asked to play on Livi’s much-criticised plastic pitch.The debate over their use has surfaced again this week via the PFA canvassing their members for views on them. While Wright is very much in the camp that prefers grass surfaces, the articial surface is not something he’s going to gripe about.“All we can do is get on with it and we are not going to use the pitch as an excuse,” he added.“Playing in Scotland, you get used to them.“However, I think having everyone playing on grass is something that would benefit the top league.“You prepare for a team each week but, for these games, you also have to prepare for the pitch as well.“All we can do as players is give our opinion about them.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c66f3c140bd42.03003741.jpg ","title":"dundee residents physically sick after sea of human waste comes through pipes in their homes","story":"Resident on a city street have been physically sick after a “sea of human waste” came through the pipes in their homes.Carol Kilburn and neighbour Gail Taylor say they have had enough of the disgusting problem in their Dens Road properties.The sludge has seeped through the pipes over the last two weeks and homes have been left stinking as a result.The pair have contacted their landlords, the environmental health department and Scottish Water about the issue.The problem is not only in the flats, with the waste also running down the side of the building and into the garden.Carol said: “There have been issues with the main drain and pipe system at the back.

suffered a damaging - draw with the Premiership#s bottom side St Mirren at Pittodrie in a match also marred by an injury to defender Tommie Hoban.Dropping points at home to the team rock bottom of the table will be hammer blow to their chances of overtaking second placed Rangers in the Premiership.The only positive, albeit minor, is that the Dons did not lose ground on Rangers who were held - by St Johnstone.A dismal day for the Reds was made even worse when on loan Watford defender Hoban was stretchered off with a knee injury late in the first half.Aberdeen fell behind to a penalty from Duckens Nazon before Lewis Ferguson headed an equalizer in the first half.However Buddies went ahead again through a strike from Kyle McAllister before a goal from prolic scorer Sam Cosgrove restored parity.Aberdeen made two changes to the side that defeated Championship Queen of the South - in the Scottish Cup fth round on Sunday.One was enforced with right-back Shaleum Logan ruled out with an ankle injury sustained in that cup victory.He was replaced by Mikey Devlin who made his first Aberdeen starts since a - defeat of Hibs on November .Devlin had been ruled out for three months with a foot tendon injury.Following his impressive sht as a half-time substitute in the cup tie Niall McGinn was handed a start with Stevie May dropping to the bench.Aberdeen should have netted the opener in the th minute when McGinn#s corner kick from the left found Lewis Ferguson racing in at the back post but he headed wide from eight yards out.Moments later McGinn raced onto a clever through ball from Mackay-Steven.Racing towards the by-line McGinn drilled a low, inviting cross along the face of goal but there were no takers.However it was relegation battling St Mirren who went ahead in the th minute when goal machine Sam Cosgrove, on  goals in the last  games, tugged down Paul McGinn.Referee Craig Thomson awarded a penalty that was converted by Duckens NAZON who fired the spot kick in off keeper Joe Lewis# right hand post.Aberdeen threatened in the th minute when Cosgrove played a superb through ball that split the defence to release Greg Stewart.Keeper Vaclav Hladky raced off his line to win the ball in a - but Stewart was left poleaxed inside the box as play raged on.Eventually Buddies kicked the ball out to allow Stewart to receive treatment.Aberdeen equalized in the nd minute when a corner from Mackay-Steven was flicked on by Mikey Devlin to the back post.Teenager FERGUSON had drted in unchecked and clinically headed home from eight yards.The Reds should have gone ahead moments later when Stewart squared a pass to McGinn but with the goal beckoning he scooped a shot over from  yards.Aberdeen suffered an injury set-back in the rd minute when on loan Watford defender Tommie Hoban was stretchered off with a knee injury.The defender went down when his studs looked to have caught in the surface going for the ball in front of the Main Stand.There was no contact with a St Mirren player as he appeared to twist awkwardly.Clearly in distress Hoban received treatment on the pitch before being stretchered off.It was the latest injury blow for the Watford defender who has only recently ed from five months out following shoulder surgery in August.Hoban also missed the whole of the previous season having suffered  a knee cruciate ligament injury that required surgery.St Mirren should have gone ahead soon after the break when Kyle McAllister#s cross from the right found Brad Lyons unmarked  yards out but his header flashed inches wide of the near post.Slack play when trying to move the ball out of defence was punished by St Mirren in the st minute when a loose pass was intercepted.Buddies raced up field and Lyons found McALLISTER who fired a magnicent,  unstoppable shot from just inside the penalty box into the far corner beyond Joe Lewis.The Reds drew level  in the th minute when COSGROVE met a cross from the left side with his  and clinically slotted home from  yards out for his th goal of the season.Aberdeen had a strong penalty claim when substitute Connor McLennan appeared to be brought down in the box in the th minute but referee Craig Thomson waved play on.Moments later Cosgrove should have put the Dons ahead when he met a Stewart cross in a great position only to fire an effort wide.ABERDEEN: Lewis, Hoban, Devlin,

MSP has welcomed a funding boost to GP practices.The Scottish Government announced that an additional £ million support will be given to surgeries across Scotland to help with running costs.Called the GP Premises Sustainability Loan Scheme, it aims to ease the financial burden for owners, who can apply for long-term interest-free loans up to % of the building’s value.More than  practices in the country have applied so far – around % of the total amount eligible.Aberdeen Central MSP Kevin Stewart said: “Folk in Aberdeen will welcome this signicant investment in our local NHS service, which will help family doctors deal with the costs of running their practice.“The extra investment will encourage more people to join the profession – which will in turn make it easier for practices in Scotland to retain and recruit staff.“The Scottish Government will always protect and support our NHS and I encourage eligible GPs in Aberdeen to consider whether they could benefit from this scheme.”It began in November  and was previously backed with £m of funding, which has now been raised to £m before April .The loan is repayable when the premises is changed or

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"hscp welcomes community commitment ahead of crunch meeting","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

The bunds will help reduce the risk of debris reaching the A in the event of a landslide.This project allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of recycling the material being excavated from the Rest and Be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works.To keep roadworkers and motorists safe throughout the works, temporary traffic lights will be in place on the A at each location. This next phase of the works is expected to last approximately  weeks.Commenting on the works, Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland’s North West Representative said: #The installation of the next stages of the mitigation measures will provide more protection and resilience against any future landslips blocking this key route at both the Rest and Be Thankful and Glen Kinglas.#The temporary traffic lights are necessary to keep our teams as well as users of the route safe during the works, and the teams will do all they can to complete the project as quickly and safely as possible.#We encourage road users to plan their journeys in advance by checking the Traffic Scotland website for up to date travel information.#"},{"url":null,"title":"third sector interface launches new approach to service delivery","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Third Sector Interfaceis changing the way it supports all types of third sector organisations, including charities, social enterprises and community groups.Due to many people now finding information through digital means and the need for information and assistance to be accessible and consistent across the whole of Argyll and Bute, not just in the main towns, the organisation has launched a new website, argylltsi.org.The website, reflecting the TSI’s new corporate identity, contains a self-serve area allowing third sector organisations to find links to a whole iety of locally-based and more national resources that can support their development needs, as well as useful templates to use to run their organisations.The TSI will be growing and developing self-service over the coming months, with the site becoming a ‘one-stop shop’ for information that third sector organisations need to set up, govern and manage organisations – everything from how to start a social enterprise to raising funding from major donors.The TSI can also now be contacted through a central freephone number #   , available between the hours of am-pm, Monday-Friday.

Her conclusions drawn from experience was that when the monitors were around, there may have been unpleasant situations, but no tragedies.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback.

Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending.

His death revealed he had left his entire fortune in his will to his native town of Troon. His legacy would provide education awards and grants for the people of the town along with a new public school. As Marr’s train travelled north he decided to break his journey, to pay a visit to his sister in Girvan. He was close to his sister Helen and visited her often after her marriage to ColonelABGrant, owner of Killochan Castle estate at Girvan, who was also a senior partner in the firm of Grant Somerville  Co in London and was later ordained as Revd. Grant in the Church of Scotland. Marr had intended to spend part of his fortnight at Girvan but extended his stay to a month. Perhaps his change of heart was due to the widespread unrest taking place in Glasgow at that time. The January of  saw the so-called ‘Harbour Riots’, where racial confrontations were breaking out between black and white merchant seamen on the town’s quayside and spreading into the town. A four day General Strike was called for on January  and four days later George Square was crammed with tens of thousands of angry workmen. Crowds of unemployed men joined in the fracas for a  hour working week. As tempers flared the army was deployed, troops brought in tanks and armored vehicles to control the crowds. As tensions heightened it was not an environment travellers would want to find themselves caught up in. Eventually CK Marr left Girvan on Saturday February  for his onward journey north to his annual shooting and fishing break in Perthshire. As the train made its way towards the city he took ill with acute appendicitis. When taken off the train at the Central Station he was rushed to the Glasgow Nursing Home, but it was already too late as he tragically died in the operating theatre. There is little known of Charles Kerr Marr, despite having a successful career in the coal exporting business. Born on October , , at  Welbeck Crescent, Troon, he was the third son of Captain John Marr, master of the merchant ship ‘Reciprocity’, sailing between Troon and Canada. John Marr and his we Amelia had five children, sons William, John and Charles, along with two daughters, Helen and Amelia. Up to the age of ten, Charles attended the Parish School in Academy Street at Troon, going on to join his two brothers at Irvine Royal Academy to complete his education. On finishing his schooling, Marr was apprenticed at A  J Guthrie, Coal Agents at Troon Harbour. Unlike his brother John, who followed in his father’s footsteps to become a sea captain, Marr left home as soon as his apprenticeship ended, to work as a Commercial Clerk with Kitstons, Iron Merchants in Glasgow. Moving later to take up the position of cashier at Clyde Ironworks, only to leave a short time later to be manager of the firm of GrantSomerville  Co in London. The move may have been influenced by A B Grant, who was a senior partner in the company and married to his sister Helen. By the time he met his future we, some years later, there is no evidence as to when he moved back to Glasgow, or indeed any explanation found as to his change of occupation. Marr is recorded in the Scotland census of  as residing in Renfrew Street in Glasgow and again on his marriage certicate a year later, where he is also recorded as being employed as a Soft Goods Warehouseman.  Little is known as to why he left coal exporting to go into the Drapery business, or where he met and fell in love with his we Agnes Murray Kinghorn. However, Agnes’s father was a General Merchant, so it would seem likely he met her in his line of work. Charles and Agnes married on March ,  and set up home at Sutherland Terrace in Glasgow’s Hillhead. Unfortunately, after only  months of married le, Agnes tragically died of Phthisis Pulmonalis . She was just  years of age. Her death was a severe blow to Marr, leaving him brokenhearted and distraught, which had a profound effect on him. Shortly after he laid his we to rest, he had thought of going abroad to work, but instead accepted an appointment with Hull Blyth  Company of London. Within a year he was made a partner in the company when he developed the firm’s export trade. His work of establishing depots in numerous ports in the world gave him an opportunity to travel abroad, especially to China and Japan, where he found an interest in collecting oriental treasures. During his time with Hull Blyth the firm went on to become one of the largest shipping charterers in the UK. Charles Kerr Marr played a signicant part in the company’s worldwide success. Charles Marr moved to London after his we’s death, he never again owned a house. All his years in London, he alternated between two clubs, the Athenaeum and the Constitutional. The nearest he came to having a home was in his later years, when he rented two rooms in Camden House at Chislehurst in Kent, which was originally built for Napoleon the rd. Just being there helped him to relax and take up golf. He was reputed to be good company with a great sense of humour and well known to be very generous. Marr was a lover of the arts and music and in all that time he rarely spoke of his we, or of her death and he never remarried, even his closest friends assumed he was a bachelor. When he retired in  he spent a good part of each year fishing and shooting in Scotland. Two years before his untimely death, Charles Marr carefully drafted out his will in , leaving his entire fortune to the people of Troon and setting out the way it was to be carried out. Marr’s coal fortune legacy has given the town a magnicent architectural school building with playing fields the envy of the country. Marr College on its own is a fitting tribute to this man of extraordinary vision. By the time Marr College opened in  the school had attracted the most renowned academics to come and teach. It was the only grant aided school in Scotland that didn’t charge fees. A public school for every child of the town, had oak led class rooms, inlaid parquet flooring, Italian tiled corridorsa copper domed library, purple velvet drapes and teachers attired in flowing cloaks with mortar boards on their heads, this was seen by all to be a stunning,not magnicent, comprehensive school, deemed to be the best school in Scotland and envied by it. The CK Marr Educational Trust, the only one of its kind in Scotland, has provided awards or grants to hundreds of Troon students, of all ages each year. The addition of the MarrEducation Resource Centre in Troon Library, the only one then in Ayrshire, is a valuable educational resource for all who use it. Marr College and the CK Marr Educational Trust are a testimony to the wishes of Charles Kerr Marr and a fitting memorial to this great benefactor. He was buried beside his beloved we in CathcartCemetery in Glasgow. Over the past century the people of Troon owe a huge debt to custodians of Marr’s vision, the Marr Trustees, past and present. Over the decades the many Trustees, Boards of Governors and ious Clerks, Treasurers and Accountants, who have and still do today and for many decades to come, have successfully upheld the wishes of the town’s greatest ever benefactor and extraordinary visionary, Charles Kerr Marr.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnChurch of ScotlandUniversities and CollegesGlasgowEducationFishingArmed forcesLove and romanceSchoolsRenfrewTroonPerthshireGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema set return prestwick after","story":"NewsCinema set forto Prestwick after  year gapReturn to the golden age of screen in PrestwickShareByStephen Houston:,  FEB NewsFriends of Broadway - they want cinema open again \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCinema made a boldto Prestwick for the first time in more than  years.

Licensing bosses at East Ayrshire Council knocked back the flurry of applications for early morning drinking before the January  showdown. Despite the historic nature of the sporting event, the department decided to maintain their stance on trying to clamp down on excess boozing during football. The East Ayrshire Licensing board depute clerk Stuart McCall told councillors it was important to maintain the standard policy and have consistency. He pointed to Celtic and Rangers matches as examples of tense clashes requiring robust licensing rules. Mr McCall said: “The standard practice is games start early and the reason for that is to limit the amount of alcohol supporters can have.” “We all know the outcome excess alcohol can have in certain circumstances.” Congragulating Talbot, he added: “We are all delighted to see the result. “The maintenance of the policy is important so we are not accused of favouritism.” Some venues wanted to offer breakfast to supporters. Auchinleck Talbot defeated Ayr by one goal to nil. Alcohol was not permitted inside the grounds and fans were told they would be refused entryintoxicated. However the licensing board made a slight concession for the Auchinleck Talbot versus Hearts game on Sunday, February .

John Senior has been an animal surgeon in the town for  years. He has also immersed himself in activities and volunteering for all sorts of causes. This week he was continuing his latest community activity as a hand bell ringer at Cumnock Old Church. John, , said: “All I want is the best for Cumnock and we are so fortunte to have so many things going on now. “I just want to make it better than it is.” The Keir McTurk Memorial Committee chose John after “much deliberation” from all the nominations. Chairman Colin Chisholm said: “John is someone who prefers to work behind the scenes rather than be at the forefront. “But his efforts for the community have proved invaluable.” John, originally from Edinburgh, has freshly retired from the Crossriggs veterinary practice in the town. When he arrived in  it was chiefly large livestock but treats mostly small animals. His we Heather, also a vet, remains involved in the management and their son Iain, the third member of the Senior family who is a vet, runs the practice. John is a very active member of the Cumnock Action Plan Committee, in which he has reformed the Cumnock Gardening Club assisted living in the arrangements for the Christmas festival and was actively involved in the poppy display marking the centenary of the end of the First World War. He is also an elder in the Trinity Church and a member of the fabric committee.

Assistance he gives to both the Highland games committee and Camps is described as “invaluable.” But he said: “I don’t like standing on a pedestal. I prefer being in the background. “I somehow manage to find time for the things I want to do and I am not very good at sitting down doing nothing. “I enjoy being active and putting things back into a town that has supported me and given me a living for  years.” The presentation is likely to be at Dumfries House.

Cycling Without Age Prestwick is transforming lives of those with limited mobility in the area with their specially designed trishaw, a light three -wheeled vehcile with pedal used in Asian countries . The three-wheeled rickshaw is a little more than a ‘sofa on wheels’ as it is engineered to accommodate two passengers in the front and driven by a pilot in the rear. Those with mobility restrictions - old and young- can take a trip to the seafront, enjoy the Prestwick promenade views and have a good old natter. Now the community project, who’s base has been kindly gted by St Ninian’s Episcopal Church, are eager to find more volunteer pilots and those keen to get out on the trishaw. Chris Cheales, of Cycling Without Age Prestwick, said: “We now have two trishaws and we are in the middle of a training programme to help - people become qualied before starting the operation in spring. We offer two-hour sessions to two passengers and there is the opportunity to go for a drink, stop to chat, pet a dog or just enjoy the views. “We are looking for people with limited mobility who may or may not also struggle with loneliness and isolation and who would benefit from the freedom of feeling ‘the wind in their hair’. “Time is a wonderful gt to give anyone. The group hope to expand as the project grows and take their trishaws on tour to visit care homes in the area. Chris added: “We envisage days allocated to ‘user groups’, to include care homes, those recommended by Dementia Friendly Prestwick, retirement housing and local churches. “Trishaws are not cheap so we need ongoing help to keep all this on the road. “We are looking forward to another sunny summer and sharing the project with others.” The Prestwick Peoples Project has also benefitted those involved, helping volunteers flourish and gain confidence. Zara Crumlish has been a Young Ambassador for Cycling Without Age for six months. Zara, , said: “I’ve always wanted to ride a bike when I was younger but I didn’t have the balance. “The trishaw has helped me get my confidence up. “It gets me out and about with the community. “And I’m excited because I really can’t wait to take elderly people out and show them the Prom.” •Would you like to be trained as a Trishaw Pilot  Or a willing volunteer to be a co-pilot to accompany trips  .

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"young footballers saddled up for funds","story":"Last Saturday, in the Co-op foyer, players took half hour shts, on two bikes, to raise more than £, towards funds to compete in the three-day Edinburgh International Youth Cup in August.A Campbeltown and District Juvenile Football Association spokesperson said: #A massive thank you to Campbeltown Co-op for allowing us to use their foyer to spin our way to a massive £,..#Thank you to each and everyone of you who supported us and also the words of encouragement, which meant a lot.#CDJFA, supported by quiz queen Helen Gilchrist, will hold a Big Quiz Night, at Stronvaar Bowling Club on Saturday March  with a £ top prize.The evening#s entertainment will include a quiz, raffles and television show games.The young spinners from left are: Josh MacDonald, , John McTaggart, , Jack MacNab,  and Daniel McEachran,._cfootballfunds_CDJFA"},{"url":null,"title":"andrew mccornick re elected president of nfu scotland","story":"Having already led the union for two years, Dumfriesshire farmer Mr McCornick will now hold office for a further two years by which time he will have served the maximum allowed under the constitution of a pair of two-year terms.After a keenly fought election, the vote for the two vice presidential posts saw Perthshire farmer Martin Kennedy re-elected to serve alongside Charlie Adam from Aberdeenshire, currently Livestock Committee chairman.The unsuccessful vice presidential candidate was Ian Sands from Perthshire, who is chair of the NFUS#s Combinable Crops committee.Under the terms of the constitution, Mr Kennedy, as a serving vice president, will be seeking re-election next year, having already served as vice president for two years.Mr Adam, being elected to the position of vice president for the first time, will initially serve for two years before the post reverts to an annual election.After the election Mr McCornick said: #There are dficult and challenging times ahead but Martin, Charlie and I have been given a clear mandate by members to represent them and we are honoured to carry their message forward.#Throughout the protracted and frustrating Brexit process, NFUS has been crystal clear about its priorities and through our ‘Steps to Change’ work we have mapped out our thoughts on a new agricultural policy for Scotland.#I believe we have a top table team, which, backed by the members, staff and secretaries, has the vision to deliver on that.#Those who choose to seek office and represent fellow members in any capacity undertake a huge commitment and although missing out, I congratulate Ian for the part he played in a hard-fought campaign and the outstanding work he does in representing his sector.#NFUS president Andrew McCornick.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

Good riddance.To say This Week is past its sell-by date is an understatement. Launched in , it seemed fresh and quirky back then to have heavyweight Neil cosy up with a coterie of pals after dark to chat about political developments. Over the years, Michael Portillo and DianeAbbott,party rivals who had known each other since school, became the Richard and Judy of the show, giggling away with cheeky chappy Neil about the issues of the day under New Labour. It was all very self-congratulatory, a bit like the times themselves.Marianne Taylor: Onus is on men to stop abusing workplace powerSixteen years later, itrsquos not only the governing party that has changed. Over the years, as the issues being became more downbeat ndash the  financial crisis, austerity and now the Brexit crisis ndash the format looked ill-equipped to deal with the big questions. Most cringeworthy of all, however, was Paisley-born Neil himself.Donrsquot get me wrong, the aggressive, belligerent interviewing style he is known for had its place, certainly back in the alpha-male s and s when he was king of the jungle . But, as is the case with Humphrys, the increasingly arrogant behaviour on air and in public debate reveals a comically self-important figure who makes Alan Partridge look in touch with the times.Take his embarrassingly pompous monologue about the greatness of Winston Churchill on last weekrsquos show, following weeks of hysterical and pointless national debate about whether the wartime PM should be judged hero or villain. Casting himself as a cross between Margaret Thatcher and a s grammar school headmaster, Neil imperiously instructed us with a severe wag of the finger that Churchill was indeed the most heroic Briton that ever lived. Talk about condescending. And also plain bizarre.Why any BBC journalist would be allowed to showboat like this on live television is quite beyond me. But it just goes to show how unwieldy Neil has become. A couple of weeks earlier he had an equally cringeworthy on-air spat with left-wing columnist Owen Jones, who took him to task over his affiliations with the right-wing press. Surprise, surprise Neil did not take kindly to being put on the spot.Marianne Taylor: Onus is on men to stop abusing workplace powerAs to why he thought it was acceptable to take to Twitter and call respected Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, whose excellent work helped expose the Cambridge Analytica scandal a ldquomad cat woman, one can only surmise - rightly, it would seem - that he believes he should be held to dferent standards than other BBC journalists. He has refused to properly apologise for this blatant misogyny.Did this catalogue of awful behaviour have anything to do with him leaving This Week  Who knows. The BBCrsquos director of news, Fran Unsworth, says she is looking to ldquodevelop future projects with Neil. Well, wersquoll see.As for Humphrys, I donrsquot doubt that some will miss his Daily Mail-style sneering and harrumphing on Today at any societal development that wasnrsquot around in his day, his astonishing insensitivity when discussing sexual crimes and the unequal pay of his own female colleagues, his terrible condescension when interviewing young peopleand ethnic minorities, but I certainly wonrsquot. The way in which he has approached Brexit, meanwhile ndash suggesting truculently to the Irish foreign minister recently that Ireland should leave the EU and ldquothrow in their lot with the UK was a particular low point ndash has led many people, me included, to switch off.Irsquom not saying for a minute BBC journalists shouldnrsquot be robust in their questioning, and there are plenty, both male and female ndash Kirsty Wark, Gary Robertson, Emily Maitlisand Nick Robinson spring to mind ndash who can incisively demolish the arguments of those in power.But punching down and wearing prejudices on your sleeve is not only editorially questionable, leaving the Beeb open to accusations of bias, but also astonishingly arrogant.And here we come to the crux of the matter: Neil and Humphrys have had their day. They have worn their arrogance and male privilege as a badge of honour for too long, lacking the humility or self-awareness to examine their own behaviour.

Good riddance.To say This Week is past its sell-by date is an understatement. Launched in , it seemed fresh and quirky back then to have heavyweight Neil cosy up with a coterie of pals after dark to chat about political developments. Over the years, Michael Portillo and DianeAbbott,party rivals who had known each other since school, became the Richard and Judy of the show, giggling away with cheeky chappy Neil about the issues of the day under New Labour. It was all very self-congratulatory, a bit like the times themselves.Marianne Taylor: Onus is on men to stop abusing workplace powerSixteen years later, itrsquos not only the governing party that has changed. Over the years, as the issues being became more downbeat ndash the  financial crisis, austerity and now the Brexit crisis ndash the format looked ill-equipped to deal with the big questions. Most cringeworthy of all, however, was Paisley-born Neil himself.Donrsquot get me wrong, the aggressive, belligerent interviewing style he is known for had its place, certainly back in the alpha-male s and s when he was king of the jungle . But, as is the case with Humphrys, the increasingly arrogant behaviour on air and in public debate reveals a comically self-important figure who makes Alan Partridge look in touch with the times.Take his embarrassingly pompous monologue about the greatness of Winston Churchill on last weekrsquos show, following weeks of hysterical and pointless national debate about whether the wartime PM should be judged hero or villain. Casting himself as a cross between Margaret Thatcher and a s grammar school headmaster, Neil imperiously instructed us with a severe wag of the finger that Churchill was indeed the most heroic Briton that ever lived. Talk about condescending. And also plain bizarre.Why any BBC journalist would be allowed to showboat like this on live television is quite beyond me. But it just goes to show how unwieldy Neil has become. A couple of weeks earlier he had an equally cringeworthy on-air spat with left-wing columnist Owen Jones, who took him to task over his affiliations with the right-wing press. Surprise, surprise Neil did not take kindly to being put on the spot.Marianne Taylor: Onus is on men to stop abusing workplace powerAs to why he thought it was acceptable to take to Twitter and call respected Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, whose excellent work helped expose the Cambridge Analytica scandal a ldquomad cat woman, one can only surmise - rightly, it would seem - that he believes he should be held to dferent standards than other BBC journalists. He has refused to properly apologise for this blatant misogyny.Did this catalogue of awful behaviour have anything to do with him leaving This Week  Who knows. The BBCrsquos director of news, Fran Unsworth, says she is looking to ldquodevelop future projects with Neil. Well, wersquoll see.As for Humphrys, I donrsquot doubt that some will miss his Daily Mail-style sneering and harrumphing on Today at any societal development that wasnrsquot around in his day, his astonishing insensitivity when discussing sexual crimes and the unequal pay of his own female colleagues, his terrible condescension when interviewing young peopleand ethnic minorities, but I certainly wonrsquot. The way in which he has approached Brexit, meanwhile ndash suggesting truculently to the Irish foreign minister recently that Ireland should leave the EU and ldquothrow in their lot with the UK was a particular low point ndash has led many people, me included, to switch off.Irsquom not saying for a minute BBC journalists shouldnrsquot be robust in their questioning, and there are plenty, both male and female ndash Kirsty Wark, Gary Robertson, Emily Maitlisand Nick Robinson spring to mind ndash who can incisively demolish the arguments of those in power.But punching down and wearing prejudices on your sleeve is not only editorially questionable, leaving the Beeb open to accusations of bias, but also astonishingly arrogant.And here we come to the crux of the matter: Neil and Humphrys have had their day. They have worn their arrogance and male privilege as a badge of honour for too long, lacking the humility or self-awareness to examine their own behaviour. Put them out to pastureso they can moan away till their hearts content, perhaps even to each other, about how hard done by they are, how it wasnrsquot like this in the old days.As research highlights, the BBC is losing younger viewers and listeners in their droves. Andrew Neil and John Humphrys are part of the problem - and the Beeb is better off without them."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-uk-must-accept-responsibility-for-its-nationals-who-joined-is","story":"But on one issue at least Irsquom in agreement with the US President: his call to Americarsquos European allies to take back  Islamic Statefighters captured in Syria makes sound sense.Before I explain the reasons why, letrsquos just for a moment take stock of the current situation on the ground in eastern Syria.As I write, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forcesbacked by the US military are poised to capture ISrsquos last, tiny enclave, bringing its selfdeclared caliphate to an end.By any standards the fall of Baghouz is a signicant moment.It ends ISrsquos grand project launched from the great medieval mosque of Mosul in northern Iraq in , when Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi seized advantage of regional chaos to proclaim himself caliph, suzerain over all Muslim people and land.In the years that followed, he and his cadres would go on to set up a barbarous governing system ndash with courts, a currency and flag ndash which, at its height, stretched from north-west Syria almost to Baghdad, encompassing some two million inhabitants.It was a reign of terror the hallmarks of which were massacres, sexual slavery and the beheading of hostages.Ever since , however, a forceful international military response has pushed ISrsquos caliphate steadily back to the point where only a few hundred of its fighters now remain in the enclave of Baghouz on the Euphrates.The SDF has already confirmed that most of those remaining fighters are foreigners.Those who do not die fighting will be taken prisoner, which brings me back to Mr Trumprsquos call for Europe to take back its nationals who became jihadist fighters.Prone to exaggeration, Mr Trump might be over-egging it somewhat in suggesting thatEurope fails to do so there may be no alternative at some time in the future but to release them.That is not going to happen. Short of a calamitous sht in the military dynamic on the ground whereby the Kurds find themselves preoccupied with, say, advancing Turkish forces and are hard pressed to concentrate on securing the IS prisoners, they will remain incarcerated.Quite simply, itrsquos in no onersquos interests ndash least of all Washingtonrsquos ndash to have hundreds of jihadi fighters back in circulation.That said, therersquos no doubt the Kurds are currently struggling to cope with the responsibility of holding perhaps , IS detainees, many of them foreign fighters from up to  countries.ldquoWe canrsquot do it alone, was how it was summed up recently by Abdulkarim Omar, a leader of the Kurdish-led foreign-relations commission, which is affiliated with the US-backed SDF.ldquoEveryone is running away from the responsibility, he insisted.Like others who have visited this part of eastern Syria, I can vouch for the fact that the Kurdsrsquo fledgling administration lacks the resources and capacity to put on trial, or detain indefinitely, so many people.The Kurds then are right when they say they should not be left to shoulder this burden. Aside from recognising this, there are very sound, pragmatic and strategic reasons why it would make sense for Europe to take back its fighters.Mr Trump alluded to this last weekend when he said that the US doesnrsquot want to stand by and watch as IS fighters ldquopermeate Europe, which is where they are expected to go.While not all those fighters being held in eastern Syria are of European origin, many are. The prospect of them at some point being able to move around freely again, perhaps making their way illegally to Europe or rejoining the global ranks of IS or a similar organisation, is worrying to say the least.No doubt this was very much on the mind of the head of Britainrsquos Secret Intelligence Service , Alex Younger, when he warned ISrsquos threat is likely to ldquomorph and spread and that its threat is ldquodefinitely not done while attending the Munich security conference over the last few days.Mr Younger also cautioned about showing triumphalism at the demise of IS, something Mr Trump, of course, is already doing by declaring a ldquo per cent victory.This is where Mr Trump is wrong and, indeed, his triumphalism flies in the face of a recent report by his own US Department of Defence that warns an ldquoeffective, clandestine IS organisation appears to be taking hold.In describing the future course of IS, counter-terrorism officials speak of an ldquoatomised, clandestine network of cells with a decentralised chain of command.This is the reality faced on the ground so, while Mr Trump is wrong to talk of all-out ldquovictory, hersquos right in voicing concerns over the potential capacity of IS fighters currently detained being recycled into the jihadi cause and ranks.For this reason alone the British Governmentrsquos reluctance to take back UK nationals who have served with IS or supported their ranks in Syria and Iraq is incredibly short sighted.Evidently, itrsquos at odds too with the kind of thinking expressed by Britainrsquos head of overseas intelligence.As its stands, the options are simple. Either run the risk of leaving those UK nationals in Syria and them rejoining IS as it goes back to its roots and re-galvanises itself as an insurgency ndash or bring them back.In so doing they would effectively be taken out of circulation and an opportunity to glean invaluable intelligence gained. Adding to these considerations too is recognising the importance of having those accused of atrocities stand trial and,convicted, facing punishment.Time and again IS has shown its capacity for strategic retreats in hard times only to rebound when circumstances change.As the MI chief made clear a few days ago: ldquoThe military defeat of the caliphate does not represent the end of the terrorist threat that we face.Itrsquos time the UK Government woke up and recognised the long-term implications of any decision it makes not to bring back its nationals who fought for the jihadists.Itrsquos time it listened to Mr Trump on that point at least, evenit should ignore his boast of ldquovictory over IS."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-the-eu-has-much-less-to-lose-from-a-no-deal-brexit-than-the-uk","story":"The main problem with a no-deal Brexit is that apart from seeing a large fleet of lorries assembled in an airfield in Kent we have no idea as to how a no-deal Brexit will impact on the UK. We are assured that we will simply revert to the position that applied in  prior to joining the EU and that it will be a simple matter of implementing World Trade Organisation rules.As far as the European Union is concerned it will be relatively simple to deal with a no-deal Brexit since the United Kingdom will be added to the list of countries not in the union and trade terms that currently apply to non-member countries will then apply to the UK. In the case of the UK we presumably will want to reap the benefit of being able to trade with the entire worldwithout the restrictions currently imposed by the EU. I have still to hear details of the arrangements that will be put in place in order to comply with World Trade Organisation rules and secure the benefits that Dennis Forbes Grattonclaims will boost the Scotch whisky sales.Sandy Gemmill, Warriston Gardens, Edinburgh.\"NO deal is better than a bad deal\", Theresa May told us at the start. That was on June , , almost three years ago. What has been done in all that time to prepare for leaving without a deal  She has never told us. It should have been straightforward to begin then to prepare for that event given the acknowledged determination of the EU to punish us for leaving, expressed the world over, even in the papers produced by Michel Barnier  Co, asit were proper conduct and only changed when complained of. Of course, they intended to punish us for leaving to discourage other EU countries from following us. Time and again the hysterical Remainers have grabbed the floor to terry everyone into some kind of deal, even a bad one. Yet a no deal Brexit was the strongest card in our hand. The one that might have ensured a deal that made sense.Instead, the deal she has been forced to accept and they now refuse to alter is completely unworkable, ties us hand and foot and leaves us far worse off than we were before we decided to leave. That was not what we voted to leave for.Most of the decisions have yet to be settled. Disputes are to be resolved by the EU court asits impartiality is a given. Nonsense! No court on the planet is ever wholly impartial and in this case, the EU will give us a few crumbs to suggest fairness while keeping the plums for themselves. Emmanuel Macron has already refused to sign unless Frenchmen are allowed to continue to fish our waters. The Spanish want Gibraltar and wont sign unless they get it. They have said this and they have a veto over the deal along with every one of the others, whose price may yet be even worse. This has been swept under the carpet, like the redactions in the \"summary\" of legal advice the government wanted hidden and only released the full document when forced to do so in December , bringing about the Government being held in contempt ndash the first time in  years. Morally, that was a disgrace. Mrs May has led the worst government in forty years! And it continues, day after day, so that we cannot recognise our Parliament as anything but a shambles. Her Government has failed and is heading for the wire, hoping that enough frightened MPs will allow her rotten deal to be voted for.She set out to lead the country to leave the EU. She was resolute, polite and that was not good enough. The men in the EU played with her like cats with a mouse. All she can hope for is to be known as the worst Prime Minister in history: the one who set out to free us of the EU and left us worse off than we had ever been. There is only one thing to do: leave with no deal. Then and only then can we secure our freedom to make deals the world over, control our borders, our fisheries and colonies like Gibraltar, that rightly view themselves as British. We need to show our courage brace ourselves to be at our best again. No deal is no disaster but an opportunity to control our own destiny.William Scott, Argyle Place, Rothesay.ON October , , Enoch Powell pleaded with the delegates to the Tory Party Conference in Brighton to reject entry to what was to become the European Union, saying: \"I do not believe that this nation, which has maintained and defended its independence for a thousand years, will now submit to see it merged or lost. Nor did I become a member of sovereign parliament in order to consent to that sovereignty being abated or transferred.\"He, unfortunately, was a voice crying in the wilderness.However, the portents of the demise of the EU are increasing daily across the \"Community\".

But isnrsquot it a shame Scotlandrsquos politics rarely has the same effect  Instead, in the last few days, this blessed country has seen yet more bitter debate about nationalism and the views of one nationalist in particular, Andrew Wilson. Mr Wilson, you will remember, was the man behind the SNPrsquos Growth Commission last year, so we should pay attention.The most controversial bit of Mr Wilsonrsquos most recent pronouncement for hard nationalists is his support for ldquosoft independence. Some nationalists would like to move immediately to a Marxist state, he says, but the party should try to create a  for a softer independence that might win broad support. ldquoThe reality, he says, ldquois change of such signicance in any organisation, let alone a major country, is a process rather than an event.Mr Wilson does not go into great detail about what he means by a soft break-up, but I think he may be onto something and, strangely, I think The Thirty-Nine Steps and John Buchan can help. Most fans of Buchan know he had a strong romantic bond with his homeland ndash you can tell that from the descriptions of Galloway in The Thirty-Nine Steps they may also know that he once said, ldquoevery Scotsman should be a Scottish nationalist. But the important point is he was a very particular type of nationalist and, crucially for Mr Wilsonrsquos idea of soft independence, itrsquos one that still exists in great numbers today.The speech Buchan gave during a debate in the Commons in  while he was an MP gives a more detailed idea of his views. The subject was home rule for Scotland, which at the time was attracting more supportand in the end, Buchan told the Commons he did not back a Scottish parliament. However, he also said thatit could be proved it would be advantageous, then Scots should support it.Read More:Andrew Wilson: SNP should back soft version of independenceThis is a pretty clear example of the kind of nationalism Buchan preferred: you might call it patriotic pragmatism, although perhaps therersquos a better way to describe a slice of Scottish opinion that has been somewhat forgotten. In a new biography of her grandfather to be published in April, Ursula Buchan also attempts to capture the novelistrsquos views and settles on an interesting description. John Buchan wasnrsquot a unionist, she says, but he wasnrsquot a nationalist either. He was a ldquounionist nationalist with concentric, not warring, loyalties.I realise that in the current climate, ldquounionist nationalist is a confusing term, but I also think itrsquos the right one for Buchan and other Scots with similar views. Not only that, I think the SNP is unlikely to attract greater support until they better understand how ldquounionist nationalists think. Thankfully, Buchanrsquos  speech is helpful in this regard because he explains it perfectly.First of all, the unionist nationalist is just as likely as any SNP supporter to have romantic views about Scotland ndash in Buchanrsquos words, nationalism on romantic or historical grounds is ldquoperfectly respectable. The unionist nationalist is also likely to believe decisions about Scotland should be made in Scotland or with Scotlandrsquos consent. To quote Buchan again,therersquos something wrong with Scotland, itrsquos the business of Scots to put it right.However, Scots in the mould of Buchan are not just nationalists, theyrsquore internationalists and they would reject putting a nationrsquos interests first whatever the consequences, as in ldquoAmerica First or ldquoScotland First. Buchan put it this way: ldquoit would be a bad dayScottish MPs ever came to support a measure which was for the moment good for Scotland, but was demonstrably bad for England hellip or the world. This is a critical point and explains why the SNPrsquos ldquoStanding up for Scotland slogan rings hollow for some voters.Which brings us to possibly the most important quality of the unionist nationalist, which is that they keep their romantic nature in balance with their pragmatic side and make decisions on what they see as the economic facts. Buchan said Scotland was a nation in the closest corporate alliance with her southern neighbour, and that to attempt to separate them would be a costly blunder. ldquoI do not believe, he said, ldquoand no Scotsman believes, in spending money without a proper .Read More:Joanna Cherry joins attack on softest possible independence planIn writing his report last year, Andrew Wilson seems to have understood all of this his awareness of the concerns of those who might be described as unionist nationalists also explains his call for slow progress towards a soft independence ndash the question is how soft it has to be. Admittedly, some unionist nationalists will never support complete independence, particularlyit is done precipitately, but perhaps they could be persuaded to support something lighter, a third way in which Scotland loosens the ties of the union until the point where it would be economically harmful ndash in other words, it would remain at least as close to the rest of the UK as the UK used to be with EU, although possibly much closer.I realise Mr Wilson has something much more like traditional independence in mind, but I think he should at least give John Buchanrsquos speech a read. Among other things, Buchan warned against ldquoarticial nationalism which manufactures dferences, but more importantly he promoted ldquosane nationalism based on what is economically good for the country. At the time, many Scots would have agreed with him. I think many Scots still do."},{"url":null,"title":"trnsmt-line-up-2019-festival-headliners-leak-online","story":":TRNSMT line-up : Festival headliners confirmedSnow Patrol, George Ezra, Catfish and the Bottlemen, Richard Ashcroft and Jess Glynne are among the reported acts being circulated on social media.Disappointing pic wvnnHUylrThe alleged leak comes after Snow Patrol told the crowd at a recent Glasgow gig that they would see them at the festival.The festival is expected to make an announcement after pm today.Our sister paper The Evening Times has contacted DF Concerts for comment.TRNSMT debuted at Glasgow Green in  afterT in the Park took an indefinite hiatus.The inaugural festival was headlined by Radiohead, Kasabian and Bfy Clyro, while last years line-up included Stereophonics, Liam Gallagher, Arctic Monkeys, Queen and The Killers."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9444117.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ian-murray-says-party-split-is-sad-day-for-labour","story":"The Edinburgh MP, who was not among a group of seven MPs who resigned the whip to form breakawayThe Independence Group, called on the Labour leader to \"decidehe wants to lead a party for the many or continue to restrict it to a party of the few\".Former shadow cabinet ministers Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie quit, alongsideAnn Coffey, Angela Smith, Mike Gapes, Luciana Berger and Gavin Shuker.Read more:Who are The Independence Group  Former Labour MPs form breakaway partyMr Murray said: ldquoIt is a sad day for the Labour Party and for me personally.

Connelly has worked in traffic control since  so theres not much he hasnt seen. The Beast from the East brought the worst weather conditions hes encountered during his many years of service. The team is both proactive and reactive in its mission to keep Scotland’s roads moving – planning for issues it can see coming and responding quickly to those that it can’t.Partnerships play an essential role in the day-to-day operations here.For example, we’re sitting in the resilience room where Transport Scotland, the Scottish Government agency which oversees our transport industry, meets during major crises, such as the Beast from the East.It is here, too, where action plans are drawn up to cope with major events on the annual calendar or roadworks on vital routes.A Police Scotland officer is based in the centre at peak times, along with Traffic Scotland’s media officers who Tweet updates throughout the day and INRIX, a radio team which transmits travel updates, both on the website and to most of our radio stations.From September to April, a MET office employee is also based in the centre.But Traffic Scotland has many more partners behind the scenes too.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"It looks likely that the council will raise the areas Council Tax rates by three per cent\"  Counterfeit cash alert after incidents reported in Fe viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FFPL | Article Teaser\"Stein explained: “We work closely with event organisers to ensure people get to the Open or Royal Highland Show with as little disruption as possible, particularly when two major events are on at the same time.“We also work with the road operating companies, Freight Haulage Association and public transport providers, such as Abellio Scotrail. We co-ordinate road and rail works to minimise the impact for commuters and the Scottish economy.”With all of the country’s roadside SOS calls also being answered at the centre, there are few down times.It’s a round-the-clock job and often a tough one, with operators witnessing incidents that take a toll.Even Stein, despite his many years in the job, isn’t immune.He explained: “Operators can take a call from someone saying they’re going to jump off the Erskine Bridge, pan the camera round and see them jumping. That can really stay with someone.“One that sticks in my mind was an accident at Charing Cross in Glasgow.“The car was a mess and as we panned the camera round we saw a child’s car seat, empty, on the road.“The room fell quiet but nothing was said. Later on, the police told us there were no fatalities and no children had been hurt – the sense of relief here was amazing.”Staff have access to counselling, should they need it as a result of anything they’ve witnessed.But you get the sense of a camaraderie among the team too which undoubtedly helps get them through the tough days.Last February and March, the Beast from the East proved a real challenge – some operators didn’t make it home for days, while others couldn’t make it in.Stein was at the helm through it all, steering the ship through the worst road conditions witnessed in Scotland in a generation.He said: “It was pretty bad in  but the Beast from the East is the worst weather I’ve ever experienced.“Usually, we can marshall maintenance teams and gritters from one part of the country to help in other areas hit by severe weather. That just wasn’t possible. “I was camped out here for five days, as was Humza Yousaf, the then transport minister. The operators couldn’t get home either so they just got on with the job, like they always do.“It was the first red weather warning in Scotland – everyone learned from it.”A Hilltip Icestriker from Finland is now being trialled on the M to ensure recovery teams can access incidents and an electric powered spreader has been deployed on the M.As for daily operations, the public also has an important role to play.“We have just over  CCTV cameras on km of roads,” said Stein. “It’s not a lot to cover such a large area.“So the public are often our eyes and ears, alerting us to breakdowns so we can send out a recovery team.“We get a lot of thank you letters as a result.”Those worried about big brother watching need not fear either.Stein added: “We don’t record number plates or incidents, unless the police ask us to.“So while we get a lot of requests, we can’t help solicitors looking for accident recordings – we don’t have them.”Crossing over the Forth is now far more reliableTraffic Scotland’s National Control Centre was opened on April , , by then depute first minister Nicola Sturgeon. Also used as a contact and education centre for pupils to find out more about the £. billion Queensferry Crossing, thousands of children visited to get a bird’s eye view as the project unfolded. At . miles , it is the longest bridge of its type in the world and also the tallest, towering mhigh. But has it eased congestion for those travelling along the east coast artery between Fe and Edinburgh According to Traffic Scotland statistics, the crossing is very much doing the job it was intended for.Since September , there have been  occasions when the Forth Road Bridge would have been closed to high-sided vehicles due to high winds.Wind shielding on the new crossing enabled it to remain open, affording far more reliability for commuters and hauliers who regularly use it.The hard shoulder on the new bridge also means there are no longer lane closuresvehicles breakdown along its span.Stein said: “The crossing’s improved reliability is delivering benefits not only for commuters but for businesses and the wider Scottish economy too.”"},{"url":null,"title":"crossing borders with your dog after brexit","story":"A.

This was despite the fact that the name and address of the person they needed to contact — his mother Edna — was engraved on the memorial.#Vandals couldn#t have done a better job,# he said.Following this wave of public concern, OIC convener Harvey Johnston and chief executive Alistair Buchan have now released a statement apologising for the concern and upset that this project has caused.#Following a tragic accident involving a young child at a Glasgow cemetery, the Scottish Government asked councils to carry out detailed inspections in the interests of public safety,# they said.#We therefore engaged in the kirkyard safety programme for all the right reasons, but recognise that the process we have followed needs to be improved. It was never envisaged that the resulting work would leave kirkyards in the condition they are in. We are sorry about the concern and upset this has led to.#As a caring organisation, responsive to public concern, we will restore kirkyards to the condition people would expect. We will also consider how best to contact and discuss the remedial work required with those concerned. People’s safety is an important concern for us and we will continue to carry out headstone inspections. As at Warebeth , we will use blue pegs to mark stones identied as being unsafe and highlight these to local community representatives.#These stones will not be touched until we publicise the inspection results and give relatives the time they need to discuss with us any work they might wish to carry out themselves.#The statement also confirmed that further updates from the council will be provided further updates over the weeks ahead.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work. Through the games we’ve designed, attendees will be able to competitively play roles on both sides of a cyber-crime.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These include:* A possible community buyout of the Black Isle Leisure Centre run by High Le Highland for Highland Council.* Appointing a business consultant to update the  business plan and probe funding applications.* Appoint a design team by competitive tender to revise the building plans and invite tenders.It was noted that the Black Isle remains a growing area with future housing and an expanding population.While a lottery bid for pound million towards the estimated poundm cost of the scheme failed back in , negotiations with the Scottish Land Fund via Highlands and Islands Enterprise to consider developing the project as a community enterprise company have continued.Mr Sinclair said: \"A unanimous positive attitude was evident at the meeting which allows further progress to be made to develop this very important project for the benefit of folk on the Black Isle and beyond.\"A follow-up meeting is planned later this month.Whats your view  Email newsdesk@spp-groupTuesday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Basically, we need to get a grip on our expenditure. As a result we have been examining every budget line and turning over every stone, to make sure that we are getting the best results from the resources being used and challenging where performance can be improved.ldquoIf you always do the same things in the same way, you will get the same results. It is time to change how we do things and so this is a budget for change.\"The change fund is an exciting element of our budget strategy and will underpin our programme of change over the coming year.Council leader Margaret Davidson said: ldquoThis is a decent, thoughtful and ambitious budget which will help move us into the future, protecting jobs and services.\"It aims to set the council on a journey of much needed change. We are all ambitious for improvement and what has struck me is the huge buy-in from all staff in challenging circumstances.ldquoThis budget will enable us to be sustainable and I am really confident that we have the necessary knowledge and expertise in our top team to take forward the change programme that is required.Chief executive Donna Manson added: ldquoThis budget process has been about us being connected. Connected to our communities, to our staff, to our partners, to each other ndash building relationships and enabling better conversations and improved understanding.ldquoI really appreciate the input from staff across the organisation during the whole engagement process, and for some really honest feedback. I am equally delighted with the really positive engagement across the political groups.ldquoWe need to manage all our resources, to redesign, to become more resilient, to be more efficient, to invest in our workforce and to plan for the future.

They are popular with their constituents.It is a sad day for our politics when such hard-working and dedicated politicians have been forced to leave the Labour Party.But I fear we are becoming a Labour Party in name only with intolerance towards anyone who happens to disagree, alongside a bullying culture by some, who have no real history in the party, to pressure MPs to leave.Communities across the United Kingdom desperately need a Labour Party that holds the values we have always held dear: that by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone. - Honda plant to close Swindon plant with , jobs at riskThe current Labour leadership is breaking the broad church that this party once built its electoral success upon – a broad church which delivered Labour governments that put the national interest first, lted millions and millions of people of all ages out of poverty, and gave hope and opportunity to all.It is now a party where people don’t all share the same values, with some at the very top content to ignore the views of the membership, appear to be facilitating Brexit, and condemn tens of thousands of workers in the process.It is now a movement where a powerful trade union official like Len McCluskey is willing to ignore the plight of the workers he represents by standing in the way of a public vote on Brexit despite it being party policy. - Alesha Macphail: Accused googled information on DNAThe leadership of our party has pushed too many people to the brink, and today the dam burst.The challenge now is for Jeremy Corbyn to listen and learn - and decidehe wants to keep the Labour Party and movement together.That means listening to members who are demanding we give people the opportunity to remain in the EU through a public vote, and learning from the distressing experiences of people like Luciana Berger so that such vile hatred and intolerance can never again be found in our movement.We have to change the culture of the party so we can change the country.By writing this today I’m sure I’ll be told by the very people who have forced out my colleagues that I should leave the party.

It was a beautul thing and I cherished it for years. But I remember one of the strange things about that Christmas was going back to school.It must have been primary  or , and we had a group discussion in class about what Santa had brought us all.At the time, I wondered why so many of my classmates had asked for what I innocently termed “boring” things, like a new coat.Years later however, when Christmas began to bite into my own budget, I realised that my child’s vision of the world had not seen the real signicance of the gts.I do not come from a particularly well-off background.For the first decade and a half of my le we lived in a house rented from the housing association.We didn’t have a lot but I had both a new coat and a bike that year.I’m not sure but I think that memory had a lot to do with my recent determination to be my party’s spokesperson on the Department of Work and Pensions .Oh some witty person – probably one of my sisters – will say it’s more to do with me getting closer to my pension.But as any WASPI woman will tell you, that’s not as close as it used to be, which is an argument for another day.No. Every week constituents come to me who have been given what can best be termed as “the run around” by some section of the DWP.: Amber Rudd: Families on universal credit did have to use food banksIt could be pensions, it could be Universal Credit or it could be the system of Personal Independence Payments for those with a disability which, as assessment systems go, is not fit for purpose.In every one of them, I see someone who deserves to be treated better.In each case I’m reminded that in this, the fth richest nation on earth, there are still people for whom le is a daily economic challenge.And what we often overlook is that the majority of those who find themselves facing an uphill financial struggle are already working for a living – the ‘just about managing’ to whom Theresa May promised so much in her first speech as Prime Minister.In a meeting this week with the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, I was stunned to hear that of the already unacceptable number of children living in poverty in this country, two-thirds are from working households.How are we getting it so wrong in this country I have written in this newspaper before about my frustrations at the problem in our country’s welfare system, of which we were once so proud.I have criticised the management of the changes in state pension age for women.And I have railed at the issues with the well-intentioned but fatally underfunded Universal Credit.Only this week the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Amber Rudd, admitted that its failings have been responsible for sending so many people to food banks.But the crux of my gripe is that I realise that we have slipped very far from the fair society, backed by a strong economy, we aim to be.: Rudd urged to ditch DWP policies after damning UN reportOne half of that, the former, we have managed to achieve. The other still seems to be tantalisingly out of our reach. And it needn’t be.I am not in Government. ButI were, the first thing I would do in my new post would be to act on that recognition which Amber Rudd is the first in the Cabinet to publicly acknowledge.I would put back the £ billion which George Osborne took out of the budget for Universal Credit.Then I would pause the roll-out and migration from legacy benefits and fix the obvious problems that are leaving families with nothing to live on for more than a month, causing people to fall into rent arrears and adding stress to an already intolerable burden.After that, I would address the issues which still allow situations where the benefits of getting a job are undermined.But, more than anything , I would want to do something about those children in poverty.I thought about them this week and I thought about that Christmas when I was no more than eight or nine years old.At that time, le was simple for me.I had a big loving family and any financial challenges my parents might have faced were well hidden from us.For my younger sisters, it was slightly dferent.When my dad died at the age of , we went overnight from being relatively well off and living in a home we owned to a single-parent family with no income. My mum went back out to work and somehow managed to give my sisters everything I had known.But, at the age of , I realised how easy it is to fall through the cracks.Then, like now, I thought about those kids in my class that Christmas.Most of them had at least as much potential as I did, but not all of them got to fulfill it.Today that thought as much as,not more than, any political principle I have is what drives my daily le. I have been lucky. I have been able to give my daughter the start in le my parents were able to give me.Maybe because of that I want every child to have the opportunity to fulfill their potential, and feel it’s up to those of us who have to make sure it happens.No family should have to choose between Christmas presents and keeping warm.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"u turn after scottish curling champs said to be snubbed in favour of celebrity team","story":"IT is usually regarded as a gentle sport, enjoyed by young and old alike.But a major row has now rocked the Scottish curling world after a team which won the national title was passed over to represent Scotland in the world championships in favour of “celebrity” squad Team Muirhead.A team led by -year-old Dumfries player Sophie Jackson won the Scottish national trophy on Saturday, but was told by sporting body Scottish Curling that due to prior qualication to the World University Games in Russia, Team Muirhead, led by Olympian Eve Muirhead - which came second in the Scottish national competition - would represent Scotland in the Women’s World Championships in Denmark.However, Team Jackson, who were Scottish junior champions in  and , requested a review of “the situation”, demanding that they should be allowed to go to the world championships, which is two weeks after the WUGS.Scottish Curling has now reversed its decision, saying that it had been a “complex issue to resolve”, adding that it had “found in favour” of a ruling within Scottish Curling regulations stating that the “winning team shall represent Scotland in the world curling championship”.It said: “After a careful review by the board of Scottish Curling we are pleased to confirm that Team Jackson, winners of the Scottish Curling Championship, will represent Scotland at the World Women’s Curling Championship in Silkeborg, Denmark - March . “Team Jackson had previously committed to represent Great Britain at the World University Gamesas their priority goal for the season and this gave a challenge regarding preparation for playing at the World Championship.”It added: “Team Jackson sought a review of the situation regarding their representation at the World Championships. This has been a complex issue to resolve and we did not want to rush the judgement.”The earlier decision sparked anger in the curling community, with some paid-up members of Scottish Curling believed to have handed in their membership over the issue, while others called on Scottish Curling management to quit.A three-time Olympian, Eve Muirhead represented Great Britain at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver , Sochi  and Pyeongchang . In Sochi, she became the youngest ever skip, male or female, to win an Olympic medal after the team scooped bronze.Her team was beaten - in Saturday’s final at the Dewars Centre in Perth by Jackson and her teammates, Naomi Brown, Milli Smith and Sophie Sinclair. After the match, Muirhead said she had not regained full fitness after an hip operation last year.Margaret Pottie, who was president of the ladies branch at sporting body Scottish Curling from  to , said: “As a past president of Ladies Branch, I am shocked at this decision. It states clearly in the back of the programme brochure that men and women’s winners of the Scottish Championships will represent Scotland in the World Championships. That’s the competition we went to see and that’s what is expected. How can this decision be justied. “I am sorry that Eve has been put in this position, but Sophie won and deserves to represent Scotland in Denmark. I am ashamed of being a member of Scottish Curlingthis is the decision being made.”Godfrey Bedford, who curls at Jackson’s home rink of Dumfries, wrote on Scottish Curling’s Facebook page: “If this decision goes ahead, I will propose that our club resigns from curling scotland and would expect many others to disaffiliate. Sophie beat Eve  times fair and square. This is ridiculous.”Ms Muirhead, who has also played the bagpipes at four World Championships and is an ambassador for Piping Live, received an Honorary degree from the University of Stirling last year and has also been honoured with a portrait at Edinburgh’s National Portrait Gallery.In a statement issued on Scottish Curling’s website, the organisation said that Team Jackson had met with the performance director and head coach of the British Curling performance programme along with the chief executive of Scottish Curling, to discuss “the next steps for them”.A line in a press release issued on British Curling’s website after Saturday’s competition stating that Team Jackson’s “next competitive outing” would be at WUGS, while Team Muirhead would represent Scotland at the World Championships was removed earlier this afternoon.In the men’s final at the Scottish championships, Bruce Mouat’s team beat the team skipped by Muirhead’s brother, Glen.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/LOVAT-V-SKYE-9.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football.

It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

It is time for an all-Ireland conversation and forum to look to the future... To define a new and united Ireland,” she said.DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said Sinn Fein is more focused on a poll than a sensible Brexit deal. “Indeed, judging by their hard border rhetoric, Sinn Fein seem to be cheerleaders for a ‘no deal ‘exit.” he said.And UUP MLA Doug Beattie said that with health and education “on their knees,” a poll would “further ision and instability”. But TUV leader Jim Allister said Mr Varadkar is only stalling because he wants the backstop in place first, “as the republican building block it is”.Alliance leader Naomi Long was open to a poll, but agreed with the SDLP that “the time is not right” due to Brexit.

When we go back and look at the stats, those are the things we will be saying.#It was a slow start to this game with both teams hitting early wides, but the pattern was soon established with James McNaughton and Alan Devine trading frees before Aonghus Clarke fired over from range.Three McNaughton frees gave Antrim the edge as he then traded points with Devine before Nigel Elliott finally shot Antrim#s first from play on  minutes to make it - to -, but this was to be their final score of the opening half.Westmeath drew level thanks to a Devine free and a magnicent sideline cut from Derek McNicholas before Devine gave them the lead.It was to get even better for the visitors on  minutes as Devine got a touch to Robbie Greville#s long delivery to find the net, while McNicholas and Devine added points to make it - to - at the break.With the swirling wind at their backs in the second period, Antrim needed a bright start and they got it with McNaughton clipping over a free and then Nigel Elliott sent Keelan Molloy in to flick to the net.McNaughton and Kevin Rice added points but, crucially, Antrim could never get ahead.The visitors rallied with the next three points and this was a lead they were to hold for the majority of the second period as the teams effectively went score-for-score.Antrim did get to within one with Conor McCann – who had what looked like a good shout for a penalty waved away when hauled back by Tommy Doyle late on – and McNaughton hitting scores. But McNicholas – who earlier clipped over another sideline – landed a monster free.McNaughton had a free that was finally given as a wide deep into added time when it appeared over, but the goal Antrim needed wouldn#t come as Westmeath held on for a crucial win.ANTRIM: R Elliott S Rooney, J Dillon, P Duffin M Donnelly, S McCrory, C McHugh C McCann , N McKeague N Elliott , J McNaughton , K RiceE O#Neill, K Molloy , C Clarke.

After giving the matter some thought, Squinter has been unable to separate two candidates, and so the prize is jointly awarded. First co-winner is Andrea Leadsom, Tory Leader of the House, for her reaction to Donald Tusk’s statement that there’s “a special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit “without a sketch of a plan”.Andrea’s response was rather more temperate than that of Sammy Wilson, who opined that Mr Tusk was a “devilish, trident wielding, euro maniac”. She remarked, with what would appear at first blush to be commendable restraint: “The man has no manners.”But on hearing Andrea’s mention of the word “manners”, a little bell went off somewhere deep in Squinter’s hippocampus and after a short period of beard-scratching and pencils-sucking, it came to Squinter why the Honourable Member is on rather thin ice when it comes to matters of polite conduct.Come back in time with Squinter to the summer of , just two weeks before Britain voted to leave the EU. Andrea was locked in a battle with Theresa May for leadership of the Conservative Party. In an interview with The Times, when asked why the party should opt for her, she replied that her rival “possibly has nieces, nephews, lots of people. But I have children who are going to have children who will directly be part of what happens next.”So there we have it. Andrea pitched for the top job by saying having children gives her more of a stake in the country. At which point, we should remind ourselves that Theresa May has spoken honestly and movingly about the fact that she and her husband Philip were unable to have children.Manners  Yih pays yer money…Joint winner is British Transport Secretary Chris Grayling who announced on Friday that he was cancelling the £ million contract he had awarded to Seaborne Freight just before Christmas to provide a ferry service from Ramsgate to Ostend to ease the pressure on the port of Dover should the UK crash out with no deal.Mr Grayling’s tenure has been one of the great comedy shows of British politics and it’s widely believed that he remains in office only to direct fire away from more senior colleagues. Not that he could have seen this mess developing. After all, Seaborne Freight was a highly respected company with a long history of professional and responsible conduct in the business of ferries and freight, right  Well, since the company only hit the news in December you probably don’t need Squinter to remind you that Seaborne Freight:• Was a completely new company• Didn’t own a ship• Cut and pasted its website terms and conditions from a pizza delivery firmand an online boutiqueThe high-flying cabinet minister sent out to back Grayling when the contract was scrubbed was Communities Secretary James Brokenshire. You know, the bloke was Secretary of State here for a while and nobody noticed.Chris’ll be gone by the end of the week, then.Fail to prepare#LET’S be honest, Jim Wells isn’t flavour of the month within the DUP. The South Down MLA had the party whip withdrawn last spring after he fell out with the top brass over his claim that they had reneged on a promise to reinstate him as Health Minister after he stepped down in  over an election hustings row.Jimbo claimed then party leader party leader Peter Robinson promised to reinstate him when andthe furious furoreblew over . He further alleged that when Arlene Foster took over as leader she ignored two written requests from him to honour Peter’s pledge. These days Jimbo’s something of a voice in the wilderness, technically still a DUP MLA but shorn of any authority to speak for the party. Which makes him of considerable interest to journalists, since the resentment he clearly still feels makes him a little bit more willing to open up about things than other DUP reps.Jim’s been at it again this week and, given the state we’re in at the moment, you’ll probably not be surprised to hear that it’s Brexit-related. Jim revealed that at the extraordinary meeting at which the party decided to back Leave in the months leading up to the EU referendum in , there was zero discussion of what a Leave vote would mean for the local economy. This would be an awkward revelation for most parties, but after the tsunami of controversies that the DUP has been through in the past couple of years, it seems to have reached the point that its brand is so polluted the tin can’t get any more dented, the label any dirtier. But that’s not the disaster that it would certainly be for any other party because the DUP’s substantial vote clearly consists of people who don’t care what they get up to as long as they’re not Sinn Féin.Lack of planning – it’ll do for ye every time. Fail to prepare, prepare to fail, that’s the old saying and nowhere does it ring more true than in the crazy world of Brexit. Let’s take a look at a few of the most notorious failures of a lack of foresight and seewe can work out where the DUP Brexit calamity fits in…Betamax’Member when video cassettes were the most exciting innovation in the history of technology  You don’t  Well, you must be under , so let’s seewe can explain. Two Japanese giants of the global electronics industry were caught up in the race to win control of the massive new market. JVC produced the eventually successful VHS format, while Sony produced the toploading Betamax system. Although the Betamax system was of a superior picture quality, it was considerably more expensive and had a shorter recording time. At a meeting in , Sony were advised by Matsushita engineers to switch to the VHS format, but declined. It wa a historic mistake, dealing the company a crippling financial blow from which it would take years to recover.Ford EdselFord were inordinately pleased with the Edsel, a new model released in the United States in , the year after the Ford family relinquished control of the company. The Edselwas designed to give Ford the upper-hand in the highly competitive premium intermediate market . The company missed the design boat, though, as the car harked back to an earlier age at a time when families were increasingly turning to compact vehicles. The Edsel was discontinued two years later, with sales signicantly less than half the break-even sales figure. Executives took their eye off the ball and didn’t realise the Edsel was flopping until over .bnhad been spent on design, manufacture and new dealerships. To this day, new models that fail are still referred to in the US automobile market as ‘Edsels’.New CokeIn the mid-s, as other soft drinks were increasingly threatening the dominance of Coca-Cola, the company decided it was going to ditch the original Coke formula and go with an improved ‘New Coke’.The  launch was a disaster and sales were badly hit, particularly in the southern states where Coca-Cola was considered an integral part of American culture. Tens of thousands of complaints flooded into company HQ weekly. The problem was not so much with the taste – the company had disastrously underestimated the hold that the Coca-Cola brand had on the American psyche. Smelling blood, rivals Pepsi began a new ad campaign with the strapline ‘Now I Know Why Coke Did It’ . Fans started booing ads for New Coke at large sports events. Just  days after New Coke was launched, the company announced that it was bringing back the old formula.Has to be a Brexit message in there somewhere, no "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-14-at-13.55.54.png","title":"eye on the past february","story":"RUC men sided with loyalist strikers last MayA SECRET memo prepared by British army intelligence has revealed that senior RUC men were closely involved with the Ulster Workers’ Council strike last May.The memo, prepared for Whitehall ministers some time ago, shows also that unormed members of the RUC “connived at and assisted with the maintenance of UWC and UDA roadblocks”.Referring to Special Branch actions during the strike the report says: “Co-opted personnel were isolated from information on events by being sent on routine tasks or being given rest days.”The ‘co-opted personnel’ referred to are Special Branch men recruited by British military intelligence to keep an eye on what is happening within the Special Branch.“As a result a ally clear picture of RUC reliability area by area has not emerged,” says the report.And it goes on to say that RUC activity of a routine nature appears to have failed by as much as  per cent.It goes on to predict that in a situation where there were large scale attacks on the Catholic population  per cent of the Special Branch would throw their weight behind loyalist gangs. A copy of the report, which was prepared as a briefing document for ministers in the Wilson Government, found its way into the hands of a number of journalists in London recently.Besides casting considerable doubt on the loyalty of the RUC to the British Government it claims that  to  per cent of the UDR could be regarded as hostile during a doomsday situation.BRITISH military policemen are being trained for civilian duties at a military training camp in Kent and it is believed that a large number of them will be drafted into Belfast and Derry within the next few weeks.The British Redcaps are expected to be used in areas like Falls and Andersonstown to take over from infantry patrols which will be withdrawn from the street.A number of UDR men from the thBattalion have attended a two-week course at the same camp and one report suggests that they may be used to form the nucleus of a ‘community police force’ in Belfast for a trial period. There have been two previous attempts to phase in military policemen to civilian duties. In the Bogside area of Derry they were withdrawn after a few days because of resistence by local people.Price sisters’ lives threatenedTHE Prisoners’ Aid Committee in London has said it is concerned about the safety of Irish political prisoners in British jails because “there is evidence of systematic victimisation by prison authorities and attempts to create hostility among other prisoners.”According to the PAC the Price sisters’ lives have been threatened by prisoners in Durham Jail. Since Christmas seven Irish prisoners have been ‘arbitarily’ moved to prisons far away from their families and another Irish prisoner’s cell has been set on fire. Officially the Home Office would not comment on the allegations but other sources firmly rejected them as being completely unfounded. There was nothing unusual in prisoners being moved to other jails under the nomal “dispersal systems”, they said.Since being transferred to the women’s wing of Durham from Brixton Prison, London, Dolours and Marion Price have been put on dferent floors in dference parts of the wing, the PAC statement said. The reason given by a deputy governor, Miss Ford, for the separation was “security”.The PAC said that the cells to which the sisters were moved were filfthy.The PAC said that in a letter to their father, the sisters said that their lives had been threatened by other prisoners all of whom were in need of medical treatment, some being “drug addicts or sex perverts”. They are being “continually harassed” by short-term prisoners, who wanted information to try to sell stories about the girls to newspapers, the statement said.“They have asked to be separated from Judith Ward, whose behaviour is bizarre, but Marion has been put into the neighbouring cell to this prisoner. Despite the fact that the Home Office describes Durham as a top security prison, Dolours and Marion and Judith Ward, are the only Category A prisoners there.“The other  prisoners in the women’s wing are Category C and they subject the girls to continuous anti-Irish abuses and obscenities. Miss Ford, the deputy governor, has instructed them to associate with these prisoners, although some of them have threatened to poision the Price sisters’ food. The families are complainning to the Home Office about the treatment of Mr Price and Mrs Claire Murphy, the girls’ sister, by Miss Ford on their last two visits.

It’s a step in the right direction after all’.”He then gave a rendition of the song to peers and was rewarded with a round of clapping in the upper chamber.Lord Duncan added: “The rest of the song I will not sing. But I will merely note that it’s a reminder that even small steps as long as they are taken in the right direction can make us go forward.“I hope that step taken on Friday is a small step in that right direction and I hope it will lead to some serious movement.”The talks ended, as expected, without a meeting of minds on any of the outstanding issues.With the UK Government reluctant to reintroduce direct rule from Westminster, Northern Ireland has operated in a political limbo land for two years, with senior civil servants being left to run public services.However, those mandarins have found themselves seriously hamstrung, with ongoing uncertainty over what decisions they are able to make in the absence of elected ministers."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland house price rise highest in uk belfast has 7","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Fair Head would be popular with climbers so I have seen the professionals and this was not it,\" he continued.\"Its madness. Had they fallen its the Atlantic Ocean. They wouldnt last long and theyd likely hit a rock on the way down.\"Theres been a lot of snow and rain over the past week and the grass is just sitting there so you put weight on it and its away from under you.\"Its a dangerous spot as its dficult for the leboat to get to so most likely they would have to wait on the Coastguard helicopter and that can be a  minute wait.

They clearly dont think anything of themselves or those that would put their lives at risk in trying to save them.\"Causeway Coast and Glens UUP Councillor Joan Baird, who lives close to the location, said she was shocked and called on those to desist.\"Just consider those that would, without thought, risk their lives to come out to rescue youyou get into dficulty,\" she said.\"I am not against climbing so long as they wear the right safety gear and are trained. But this does not look to be the case.\"Over the summer there would nearly be daily call outs. I was out walking today and there were paths that I felt were not safe to walk on given the amount of slippage we have had after the snow last week. The surfaces are in poor condition and very dficult.\"I would call for those doing this to stop.\"Ryan Gray Senior Maritime Operations Officer for HM Coastguard added: \"The recent photos taken at Ballycastle are concerning, we want people to enjoy themselves at the coast by making sure their visit is one to remember and not one they’d rather forget.\"We strongly recommend you do not attempt to climb up or down clfs unless you are properly equipped and trained to do so, and don’t attempt to climb clfs as a short cut. If unequipped for a climb it only takes one slip or a loose rock for it to end in tragedy. Remember,you think someone might be in trouble along the coast or out at sea please call  and ask for the Coastguard.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37812018.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/kill.jpg","title":"ulster woman set alight by candle during mass saved by gaa star","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Brexit aside, good luck to them. Now the leboat is launched, it’s time the others clambered aboard.”The Times describes the news as “a seismic moment in what has become our rolling national political crisis”. The paper says the group may have performed an “important public service”, adding: “Whether the defectors can go one better than the SDPand succeed in creating a new force in British politics capable of destroying the old party system and winning power is an open question.“There’s little doubt that in holding out the prospect of creating a new party they are responding to what appears to be a deep public appetite for an alternative to the traditional parties.”The Times   Labour MPs including, Luciana Berger,and Chuka Umunna , announced their resignations in Westminster and the creation of The Independent Group in the House of Commons.

Meanwhile, the Daily Mirror says the split could prove a boost to the Conservatives, saying: “The only winner is May herself.”“What happens next is crucial, more Labour MPs ripping up party cards to join what is calling itself an Independent Group would be another gt for the Conservatives,” it writes in its leader.The paper says Labour should consider why the seven MPs quit, to avoid more following suit and to unite the party.“The prospect of a Labour government is a little more remote today and the Tories a little more secure as a result of the split,” it adds."},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say february","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs Mitchell explained that following her sonrsquos death, his owed back pay from the Army would have settled the debt.The soldierrsquos mother also revealed that he had told her about two incidents in Afghanistan which had upset him.In one of them, he had been due to be the soldier at the front of the patrol but was swapped with a colleague at the last minute. The soldier who replaced him subsequently suffered severe leg injuries in an attack.Mrs Mitchell also told the inquest that towards the end of , her son had become hyper vigilant, confided in her less, was jumpy and struggled to sleep.She described how he had successfully applied for his ldquodream job in the Army as an outdoor instructor, explaining this had involved undertaking courses in the UK, Spain and Germany which left him very tired.The soldierrsquos mother also described how her son had felt isolated after a knee injury held him back from joining his unit in Afghanistan, and instead had to serve with a dferent unit.She said that when he ed to Ballykinlar and the new job, he continued to feel isolated as a number of soldiers were taking redundancy at that time.ldquoEverything hit him at that precise moment. He thought everyone was leaving, he was exhausted, his back pay hadnrsquot come through, he had had a row with Cherand he had just got back after being away for a long time.Mrs Mitchell added that she did not blame the army for her sonrsquos death but felt more could have been done to help him.A statement form Rleman Mitchellrsquos friend, Kendall Gibson, also referred to an incident when the  year-old ran away from fireworks.ldquoHe said the fireworks reminded him too much of Afghanistan, stated Mr Gibson, adding that he was also concerned about his friendrsquos drinking.Three soldiers mdash friends of Rleman Mitchell mdash who had discovered his body were sent twice to another barracks in Lisburn for treatment which included counselling.The inquest also heard that it was common place for soldiers to refer to the local army base as ldquoBally-kill-yourself.Driving instructor William Riley, who had been taking Lance Corporal Ross for HGV lessons in the week before his suspected suicide, told the inquest that the soldier was one of many who used the term.Mr Riley told how the Lance Corporal had cut a ldquofrustratedrsquo figure in the week before his death, displayed an attitude problem and had been involved in a verbal altercation with another instructor two days before his death.The inquest continues..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Art","story":"A HIGHLY acclaimed Downpatrick-based charity has secured a signicant financial boost from the Department of Justice.The Le Change, Changes Lives organisation mdash based in Market Street mdash has secured a slice of a near poundm funding cake made available under the government departmentrsquos assets recovery scheme.Over poundm has been distributed to organisations across the province since the schemersquos launch in , with the Downpatrick charity aiming to use its pound, three-year funding package to provide its clients with basic food hygiene training, alongside cooking participation and demonstration skills.The charity helps and supports people suffering with a range of mental health issues and addiction problems, offering professional and confidential counselling, mental health and addiction support and suicide intervention services.It also works to help minimise social isolation, alongside encouraging wellness and recovery and family support.Since its launch, Le Change Changes Lives has provided opportunities for people with a iety of problems to engage in constructive activities, including giving new le to old furniture through the very successful Pop Up Art initiative.The money secured under the assets recovery scheme, which is managed by the Policing and Community Safety Partnership, will finance the charityrsquos No Lost Cause project.Charity officials say the project is designed to provide an ldquointergenerational ersionary and therapeutic community programme which aims to encourage disadvantaged and disengaged people to find their potential and build upon it, using activities, counselling, advocacy, training and support.A logo is being used to publicise the project inspired by the lsquoNot Waving but Drowningrsquo poem by Stevie Smyth which is often told in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. It gives an account of a drowned man whose distressed thrashing in the water was mistaken for waving.Charity officials say the No Lost Cause initiative is designed to complement the highly successful Pop Up Art project which is funded by the Big Lottery until this October.Over the le of the No Lost Cause project, charity officials will strive to reduce crime through erting people away from substance abuse and associated links to criminal activity.Le Change, Changes Lives officials have confirmed that the new project also aims to reduce reoffending by providing training and skills development activities and counselling to deal with substance and relationship family issues and provide support to improve the self-esteem of participants to help them re-engage with family and communities.They hope that through the basic food hygiene training, cooking participation and demonstration project that it will help parents revive cooking healthy, affordable family meals, to be eaten together at the kitchen table, helping achieve interaction and involvement in young peoplersquos livesAilish Teague, who helped establish the Downpatrick charity with her husband Manus, is delighted with the Department of Justice funding.She said competition to secure the money for the next three years was competitive, with groups in each of the provincersquos  councils eligible to apply.ldquoThe application was made through the Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the asset recovery is a brilliant resource, with money taken from criminals invested back into community projects, said Ailish.ldquoWe can use this money for the programmes we deliver, working closely with people who have a range of addictions.ldquoOur clients are also delighted that we have secured this funding which will enable is to deliver an NVQ Level One in hospitality services from our Market Street base with the food hygiene aspect of the course designed to give people a taste of employment.While delighted to have secured funding under the Department of Justice scheme, charity officials are conscious that their Lottery funding ends this October.Mrs Teague says officials have met with Lottery representatives and has suggested that the chances of having their funding extended are ldquozero to nil.She added: ldquoIt will be dficult to secure more Lottery funding which could leave us with no money to finance our core costs including rent and other overheads.

They were well prepared.ldquoThey had carried out research which helped them to face questions about migration and environmental issues. There was no doubt, they had been given the short straw as the other countries were ready to attack them for their current position in wanting to leave the EU.ldquoHowever, the students put aside their own views and represented the country they were delegated, in this debate.ldquoBeing the UK is what made it so challenging and also so rewarding as they did a fantastic job.Mrs Orsi said: ldquoNot being able to participate in future debates is only one of the educational detriments to leaving the EU.ldquoI think our students are going to be greatly affected on many levels, both in terms of academic opportunities, funding and employment. It is the very people who were not able to vote who will be impacted upon most.Ciara said studying A-Level politics definitely helped the girls flex some political muscle in their challenge.She added: ldquoWe have been discussing Brexit a great deal in class and we felt secure in our knowledge.ldquoHowever, what we did find challenging was trying to find out the positions of other smaller EU countries in terms of their policies on migration and the environment.ldquoI am very interested in politics and as a language student, I feel it is important we are involved in these debates to ensure we continue to develop our understanding of our European neighbours.ldquoWhat is unfortunate is the fact this might be the last time we will be asked to participate as we will no longer be a member state.The debate was organised by the British Council with the aim of developing studentsrsquo intercultural understanding of other countries while learning more about the political workings of the ious states..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch farming family feature on BBC documentary  ","story":"THE trials of farming will be shown through the eyes of a Ballynahinch family as they are featured tonight in the BBC Two series, This Farming Le.Top beef cattle breeder Geoff Rodgers allowed a film crew to capture him and his family work their -acre farm between Ballynahinch and Dromara for most of last year.Geoff inherited the farm when his father died Martin and runs it with his we, Lizzie, who is a special needs classroom assistant at Spa Primary School, with their three children, Emma , Martin , and  year-old Lucy.He admitted that he had turned down previous offers to take part in other farming shows but finally agreed to take part as he was a real fan of the show.The result is a moving insight into what it takes to care for  animals  hours a day and what happens when it all goes wrong.ldquoI think some viewers will be reduced to tears. Well, thatrsquos what happened when all of the farmers featured watched the programme a few weeks ago, said  year-old Geoff.ldquoIt will show that there is a real connection between the family and the animals and itrsquos not all just about sales or winning competitions.Two months before the crew started filming last January, the family were hit with terrible news mdash Bovine TB was discovered in their pedigree herd and  animals had to be slaughtered.A movement restriction then had to put on the herd which meant that no animals could enter or leave the farm until two consecutive TB tests prove negative.The programme catches up with the family on the day a vet calls to carry to do the next test and to determine whether any more of the herd will have to be slaughtered.ldquoIt just happened that the crew came to us in one of the most challenging times for the farm, said Geoff.ldquoAnd while I wonrsquot gave too much away, what happens not only affects me but also my children as they all get involved, especially the youngest Lucy, to help me get the animals ready for the likes of Balmoral Show.ldquoWe not only lost some of the animals but you also lose years of breeding, particularly with some of the animals my father had bred them, which was hard, and then of course, therersquos a knock-on loss of new calves.ldquoIt was particularly hard as I had buyers waiting to buy bulls and cattle of me but we couldnrsquot do anything until we got the all-clear.The tension builds over the next few episodes of the show as the deadline looms to Balmoral Show mdash the highlight of the farming calendar in Northern Ireland and the major sales day for Geoff.Viewers will see that the Rodgers familyrsquos hopes of further success at Balmoral are pinned on bull Mario, who Geoff described ldquoas a real character and his young half-sister, Nadia.This Farming Le starts tonight at pm on BBC ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"British Irish group on High Street conference  ","story":"THE impact of online sales on the High Street was discussed at a recent meeting in Newcastle.Representatives from the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly were in the resort where they were met by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin.Mr McGrath explained the committee has a dferent area of investigation each year and that in  is focusing on the impact of online sales on the High Street and how governments can deliver initiatives and projects to address the problem.The Assemblyman said with the nature of the traditional High Street changing, many people, especially the young, are shopping online with this trend only going to increase.ldquoWe are seeing and hearing that people want experiences and see their shopping trip as much more than simply shopping, wanting to incorporate food and activities as part of their experience, said Mr McGrath.ldquoHaving clean, welcoming public spaces, areas that can facilitate events and having a erse range of experiential shops and boutiques is critical in making the High Street thrive. In Newcastle, the public realm and promenade schemes, in tandem with the shop front improvement scheme, have helped the resort buck the trend and is reporting increasing footfall.Mr McGrath also highlighted the need to continue to develop experiences people can avail of to maximise footfall and is confident ambitious future proposals including a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes will be critical to enhancing what Newcastle has to offer.He continued: ldquoIn Downpatrick, the former Irish Street police station and car park have the potential to redevelop the town and breathe new live back into its retail centre.ldquoDeveloping a space here which can enhance and deliver a customer experience and product will be critical to developing new shops and products, but also complement existing businesses too.ldquoRates and the entire rating scheme was a major recurring theme from business organisations and this will form part of a report being compiled by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly following their visit.Mr McGrath said the inadequacies of the rating system were well known, with the British-Irish body, of which he is a member, keen to find other ways of helping businesses thrive.The MLA added: ldquoTimes are changing and local authorities and central governments must reflect this in the work they do. I look forward to the report our committee will deliver which will reflect on time spent in Newcastle, Belfast, Dublin, Newcastle Upon Tyne and Stockton on Tees.Cllr Murnin said he was delighted that representatives of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly view Newcastle as an example of good practice for their research into revitalising the high street.He continued: ldquoWe have worked very hard to make our district a better place to carry out business and as a place to visit. Regenerating the town centre and promenade in Newcastle has played a signicant role in increasing business and footfall to the town. I am pleased to see our work receive this recognition.During the delegation visit, local authority officials gave presentations on the regeneration of Newcastle and the tourism events strategy for the town.In addition, a representative from the Department for Communities spoke about the Main Street Environmental Improvement Scheme in the resort and the departmentrsquos role in the resortrsquos overall regeneration.At the end of the meeting, delegation members said the examples of successful regeneration they witnessed would prove beneficial to their enquiryrsquos conclusions and eventual recommendations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan actor adds her opposition to disposal plans  ","story":"SHE may have left the Mourne Mountains to pursue an acting career on stage and screen but the Mournes have not left Niamh McGrady.The Castlewellan-born actress has spoken of her horror at recent media stories which claim the Government is looking to the Mournes as a possible location to store nuclear waste.An area of granite bedrock running from Slieve Gullion in Newry to the Mourne is being considered mdash amongst other locations mdash as suitable for an underground disposal facility, according to a preliminary report by Radioactive Waste Management , a UK State-owned company.Other locations include an area of rock between Omagh and Cookstown, a location between Belfast and Larne, areas around Coleraine, Co Londonderry, and Ballymoney and Ballycastle, in Co Antrim.Niamh, who has starred in Holby City and The Fall, called for all local people to lend their support as Newry, Mourne and Down District Council passed an emergency motion last week unanimously opposing any future facility.ldquoI am absolutely horried to hear about proposals to host nuclear waste in the Mourne area, said Niamh, who now lives in London.ldquoMourne is an area of outstanding natural beauty, which tourists and local people adore the area alike.ldquoWe do not create nuclear energy here, so why should we be treated as a dumping ground  We will all have to pull together to ensure that this travesty absolutely cannot happen.The Mournes are particularly beloved by the actor, who was born and reared on the Bunkers Hill area of Castlewellan.She married her husband, Dan, close to Spelga Dam just last August and regularly walks in the Mournes when she is home.The  year-old also admitted to often feeling ldquoemotional when it came to Mournes as she was interviewed on the lsquoEamonn Mallie: Face to Face withhelliprsquo series for UTV last night.Apart from giving her viewpoint on her support of the   movement, which calls for equal representation of women in all areas of Hollywood by , Niamh also opened up about her own issues with mental health.She told Mallie: ldquoI have experienced anxiety and depression off and on since my teens. Itrsquos something I have always had to be aware of in my own le. I feel very strongly that there are issues in Northern Ireland that arenrsquot being addressed as far as mental health is concerned.A former pupil of St Malachyrsquos Primary School in Castlewellan, Niamhrsquos dficulties compounded after leaving Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch. A talented actor, who shone in the schoolrsquos theatre productions, she applied for and got a place at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardf.Niamh was fortunate that while not academically minded, she found that drama, theatre studies and English always came ldquonaturally to her in school.The youngest of five siblings, Niamh says that she had always wanted to leave Castlewellan for ldquoan adventure. But she did not realise that her living in Cardf, away from family and friends, would take such a toll on her.ldquoI was just very, very homesick because our experiences in Northern Ireland were so unique and I didnrsquot have anyone that I could explain that to, she said.ldquoI felt emotionally unsupported. I felt very much like fish out of water as I was surrounded by a lot of very wealthy people and I struggled to connect with them. I was longing for the familiarity and the closeness, and the craic of home. My homesickness lasted for many years, it didnrsquot just go away.ldquoEvery time I went home for Easter or Christmas I was in floods of tears going back to the airport but yet I made myself do it, nothing nor nobody  was forcing me to do it.She went gone to appear alongside actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame in an acclaimed production Macbeth which played Londonrsquos West End and New Yorkrsquos Broadway, as well as former X-Files star Gillian Anderson and  Shades heart-throb Jamie Dornan in the psychological murder drama The Fall.Niamh is currently working on two film projects and says that as a newly married woman, her professional and personal le is going great.However, she maintains her mental health by practicing yoga and mediation and feels it is important to be upfront about having had issues.She explained: ldquoI donrsquot see a problem talking about mental health because I donrsquot like that itrsquos still taboo. If it helps one person seek help, then thatrsquos great.ldquoPeople could be sitting with mental problems and they donrsquot know it. Because thatrsquos what anxiety and depression do, they sneak on you and it really starts to alter your view of the world without you noticing.ldquoOver time with mediation you can be in control of your mind.

Hutley was given another chance around  minutes and this time took full advantage after Enniskillen had been deemed to be offside on the back of a break from Down scrum half, Chris Gibson.For the remainder of the first half, and indeed for  minutes in the second half, the score remained at - with both teams trading blows, but neither were able to alter their account on the scoreboard.Down did have their chances to take the lead, but lacked the finesse in handling that they had shown against their rivals from Carrick and Omagh in previous rounds.As the game entered the final quarter, Enniskillen managed to extend their lead, scoring a try by barging over from short range following a well won line-out.With Enniskillen now in possession of a  point lead, Down were left with no alternative but to chase the game. Again, they created some opportunities and applied pressure in Enniskillen territory with some great carries from Josh Hanlon, Conor Moag and Joe Charles, but the dogged defence of the locals held out and with it, Down frustration grew which made putting quality attacking play together even harder.In the closing minutes and with the outcome of the fixture already beyond doubt, Enniskillen added a final unconverted try confirming them as the team who would progress to the quarter-finals.The final whistle brought bitter disappointment to the hard-working Down squad who knew they hadnrsquot been at their best on this occasion.The side now enter the Subsidiary Shield competition and they have drawn Royal School Dungannon at home in a quarter-final game to be played on Saturday, February, , at am.Having been finalists in this competition for four consecutive years and winners in , everyone at Down High knows there is plenty left to play for this season..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch horse breeder is a very disappointed man this week mdash and all because of the lsquoflu.

His parents and medical team are constantly working to ensure his lungs remain as clear of mucus as they can be.Jen said: ldquoItrsquos hard to believe when you look at him that anything is wrong as he looks so perfect, but inside him the mucus is causing havoc.ldquoDermot and I never expected to becomes nurses as well as parents to our child. We do his treatment willingly but with heavy hearts.ldquoIf the drugs didnrsquot exist, I think we could just accept things as they are and get on with our lives and make every day count.ldquoBut as it is we canrsquot rest until we have access to Orkambi and the pipeline of drugs for Lorcaacuten and all the others with cystic fibrosishere need.ldquoThis situation makes it dficult to enjoy our son without feeling pain at time passing.The couple, who live off the Vianstown Road, believe that the sooner their son starts on Orkambi the better.ldquoOrkambi not only slows the decline in lungby up to %, it also reduces hospitalisations by up to %, Jen explained.ldquoEvery day people go without access to these drugs is a day in which their body could become more damaged. Since he was  days old, Lorcaacuten has not had a single day without taking some type of antibiotic, as well as  enzymes.ldquoSome people [including young children] with CF have to attend the hospital for two weeks of IVs every three months and thatrsquos considered to be ok when there is a drug that could potentially help Families of CF sufferers believe that Orkambi can lsquostop the clockrsquo on further decline of the patient as they get older.However, the US drug company which developed it has so far failed to agree a price so that it could be introduced by the UK.Jen added: ldquoThe drugs currently in trials are supposed to give sufferers a chance at a near normal le, but this is partly dependent on them being healthy enough when they begin taking them. There is no time to wait.ldquoTwo hundred and twenty six people have died in the UK since Orkambi was licensed over three years ago. We need Orkambi and we need it now.The couple have been lobbying local politicians to get their help at keeping their campaign in spotlight in Government.Strangford MP Jim Shannon raised the plight of Lorcaacuten at Westminster this week.South Down MLAs Jim Wells and Sinead Bradley, along with Lagan Valley MLA Trevor Lunn, are planning to host a meeting in Stormont within weeks with Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.Mr Shannon said: ldquoI was contacted by people throughout Northern Ireland asking me to push government to allow a crown licence for this le-changing drug, as I have been vocal in my belief that this drug should be available on the NHS.ldquoWhat impacted me most was a mother in my area who sent me a picture of her beautul two year-old son with his little mask on, telling me that he was now old enough to get it and it would make such a dference to him.ldquoI supported the calls for the drug and will continue pushing government to find a way to overcome the issue between the drug company and NICE guidelines.While Jen says she has received local cross-party support, she is urging people to sign the petition

technology is to be used to inform peoplethe bathing water at Newcastle beach is safe to swim in.The beach is one of six across the province which features in a new EU-backed initiative to provide people with live updates of the water quality.The resortrsquos beach and surrounding river catchment area has been selected as part of a major new study, with a weather station and river water level recorders already in place to send real time data to a server which the public can access.A new electronic sign is to be erected at the Downs Road car park to provide live updates on the water quality, but the European Unionrsquos so-called SWIM project goes a step further with people able to get information via text messages and internet alerts.News of the new initiative comes just three months after it was revealed that while Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough beaches continue to enjoy some of the best bathing water quality in Europe, it was a case of lsquomust do betterrsquo for Newcastle, with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs labelling the resortrsquos water quality as ldquosufficient.Details of the SWIM project were outlined at Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.Councillors were told those involved in the scheme are working on developing a real time monitoring system, allowing local people and visitors to the beach to check the water quality via a series of measures.Council officials say the innovative project will enable what they have described as ldquoshort term pollution to be predicted.Funded by the Special EU Programmes Body, those behind the project which includes Newcastle, Castlerock, Portrush, Waterfoot, Ballyholme and Ballywalter beaches in Northern Ireland and Clogherhead, Enniscrone and Ladyrsquos Bay in the Republic, say it will help protect public health.In addition, they are confident that it will signicantly improve communication about water quality and contribute to tourism promotion in the resort.At Monday nightrsquos council meeting, Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said: ldquoThis new programme is good news for the resort and can have a positive impact on tourism.ldquoThe fact that people will have real time access to the quality of the bathing water builds confidence which is positive.ldquoThere is a problem with nitrates finding their way into the water at the beach and it is something that needs to be addressed.ldquoHowever, the fact that we will soon have a scheme which enables people to know the quality of the water before they take a dip is groundbreaking.Rowallane councillor Harry Harvey, said the decision was good news for Newcastle and could boost visitor numbers.ldquoThis is a forward step for a beach where the water quality has improved from what it was a number of years ago, he said.ldquoThe beach has yet to achieve blue flag status which in part recognises the quality of the water and it would be greatthis could be secured in the long term.ldquoWith the focus on the here and now, the provision of the electronic sign and the availability of real time information is indeed a welcome development and a forward step for the resort..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource

recently recorded a single at the iconic Abbey Road Studios, a place made famous by The Beatles.Calling the experience of recording in the same studio as The Beatles ldquosurreal, Sean explained how the opportunity arose.ldquoIrsquove just recently joined up with a guy called Rory Gallagher, hersquos from Kilcar, Donegal, and his project is called Rory and the Island for he owned the Island Bar over in Lanzarote for five or six years before he came home. He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March .

Two years ago the electorate in Northern Ireland mandated the parties including Sinn Fein to enter into talks to form an Executive. They refuse.”Mr Flanagan added: “Border poll now could inflame already tense political situation.”Last week former taoiseach Bertie Ahern said calls for a border poll in the middle of the Brexit deadlock were “irresponsible”.Addressing Westminster’s Exiting the EU select committee, Mr Ahern said he strongly believed a border poll should not happen for the “foreseeable future”.Sinn Fein’s Niall O Donnghaile branded Mr Flanagan’s comments “ill-informed” and “devoid of reality”.Senator O Donnghaile said a poll would be a “legitimate exercise in democratic expression” and added: “While appreciating minister Flanagan spent very little time here in his previous capacity as foreign affairs minister, it is obvious that his latest remarks are even more monumentally out of touch and ignorant of the political reality transpiring on the ground.”UUP MLA Alan Chambers blasts Sinn Fein’s ‘double standards’ on legacy Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolMan caught with  lsquopackagesrsquo of cocaine in his body at Belfast City AirportBallymena manager David Jeffrey praised his side after their - defeat to Linfield in the BetMcLean League Cup Final.LIVE BLOG: League Cup final  - Ballymena United v Linfield          ..

Does he mean intelligence files “Republicans used to complain about ‘British securocrats’ spreading  information. Now they seem to be setting great store in intelligence files gathered by the same people who they previously said could not be trusted.“I rather suspect that where intelligence files name informants or criminal suspects who are loyalists, Sinn Fein will accept such information as gospel truth. But where intelligence files name republican informants or suspects, this will no doubt be dismissed as disinformation and dirty tricks. “As with their attitude to the EU, Sinn Fein appear to have made a complete U-turn regarding information and files. They have certainly come a long way from September  when the IRA detonated a ,lb bomb outside the Northern Ireland Forensic Science Laboratory near Belvoir Park, in a bid to destroy evidence in terrorist cases. In response to Mr Chambers’ comments, Sinn Fein MLA Linda Dillon said: “I think it’s disgraceful for Alan Chambers to attempt to pit the needs of victims against other victims.“Sinn Fein made an agreement with the two governments and the political parties at Stormont House to give all victims a level playing field in their efforts to get maximum disclosure about the killings of their loved ones. “More than four years on the British government has refused to implement those agreed structures and victims continue to be faced by cover ups and denied truth and justice.Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald objects to George Hamiltons replacement coming from within the PSNI Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The PSNI has admitted that it failed to give the police ombudsman ‘signicant and sensitive’ information related to under cover policing in investigations into up to  UDA murders in south and west Belfast and in the north west.“The real question here is what is Alan Chambers’ position on the PSNI’s failure to make available relevant evidence to investigations by the police ombudsman into  murders ”try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES: The  locations across N.I. where speed camera vans operateTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolMan caught with  lsquopackagesrsquo of cocaine in his body at Belfast City AirportBallymena manager David Jeffrey praised his side after their - defeat to Linfield in the BetMcLean League Cup Final.LIVE BLOG: League Cup final  - Ballymena United v Linfield          ..

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions. As part of this Lisa is a member of the RICS Registered Valuers Scheme.Lisa also provides rent review and lease renewal advice to landlords and tenants throughout Northern Ireland.Additionally, Lisa was involved in the  non-domestic rating revaluation providing advice to a wide range of clients and negotiating the valuations with Land  Property Services on the clients behalf at application and appeal stages. Following the  revaluation Osborne King saved clients in excess of £.m. Lisa is working on the upcoming  non-domestic revaluation on behalf of a iety of clients.“I am fortunate to be involved in a wide range of work, some of which involves regular reporting to key clients such as one of Northern Ireland’s largest car showroom operators and well-known supermarket, convenience store businesses and global coffee brand.”  For more information contact Osborne King on   , email property@osborneking or visit the website at www.osbornekingView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/harbour_1221.jpg","title":"belfast harbour sets new cargo record","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Belfast Harbour has handled more than  million tonnes of cargo for the first time in its history.
