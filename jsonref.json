It\u0027s enough to tip you over the edge.\u0027It was initially thought that the letters had gone to around five families who had lost children, most of them premature babies.         Hollie Nightingale of Stalham, Norfolk, whose daughter Alissia lived just 20 minutes after being born 19 weeks premature, said she was shocked to receive the letter addressed to \u0027the parent or guardian of Alissia Chaplin\u0027But the council has now admitted that 42 letters were sent out to 41 bereaved families, including one who had lost two children.The council\u0027s leader Andrew Proctor and Sara Tough, director of children\u0027s services, are now writing to the 41 families to apologise for the blunder.Mr Proctor said: \u0027We are truly sorry for the pain and distress caused to the families who were mistakenly sent a schools admissions letter about their child who had sadly passed away.\u0027At the moment, our priority is contacting the families concerned so we can apologise to them directly.\u0027In terms of what happened, as soon as we found out the letters had been sent we launched an investigation through our internal audit department to ensure that such a mistake does not happen again.\u0027This should never have happened in the first place and we offer our most sincere apologies to all the families involved.\u0027Ms Tough added: \u0027I sincerely apologise to anyone who has received this letter in error. I understand how distressing this must be for families who have lost a loved one.Norman Lamb, North Norfolk Liberal Democrat MP, said it was crucial that the council found out what had gone wrong with its systems.He said: \u0027Obviously, my heart goes out to these families. It\u0027s unimaginable how traumatic it must be to be confronted by such a letter amidst their own personal tragedy.\u0027Hollie Nightingale of Stalham, Norfolk, whose daughter Alissia lived just 20 minutes after being born 19 weeks premature, said she was shocked to receive the letter addressed to \u0027the parent or guardian of Alissia Chaplin\u0027.         The letters were erroneously sent (Ms Nightingale who has battled Post Traumatic Stress Disorder since her daughter\u0027s death initially assumed it was a typing error and was about her oldest daughter, Anastasia before she realised it was about her dead baby.She said: \u0027Seeing the letter made me remember I\u0027m not with my child. I\u0027ll never have those birthdays, Christmases, or get that first day at school like I did with my other kids. All I could think was why would they want to remind me of all that?\u0027She reported the incident to the council, speaking to a switchboard operator who apologised, but was unable to help further.Lizzy Jones claims she collapsed on her kitchen floor after receiving the letter about her son Kai Jno Baptiste who was born premature and died six months later of chronic lung disease in April 2016.Miss Jones, 28, of Rockland St Mary, Norfolk, said: \u0027It was awful. I just fell down and couldn\u0027t stop crying. I felt like I hadn\u0027t felt like this since the day that Kai died.\u0027Kai starting school is one of those milestones that I\u0027m never going to have with him.\u0027Miss Jones called to complain and was told that data about children came from NHS records, which were sometimes up to a year out of date.But she said: \u0027Kai has been gone for three-and-a-half years, not a year. The NHS did everything for Kai in his six months.\u0027It was the council I had to go to and register Kai\u0027s death, so how can they not have that information?\u0027Gina Prentice said she and her partner Shaun Horth felt \u0027tormented\u0027 when they received the letter asking them to register their son Kian for a school place.Kian died in their arms when he was just six-days-old after being born prematurely in February 2016 weighing just 888gA problem with his oesophagus meant he was unable to swallow, and he had a heart attack after major surgery to widen his airway.Ms Prentice said: \u0027I am hurt and angry. It reminded me of the milestones we won\u0027t reach.\u0027There was no need for that letter to be sent and achieved nothing but making us who have lost children go through the pain again and again.\u0027How does this happen in 2019, when the people sending the letter are the people who registered his death? They need to sort this system out so nobody else has to go through this heartbreak?\u0027Lisa Weller of Diss, Norfolk, whose daughter Francesca Rose who died of an infection just four hours after being born in September 2015, said: \u0027It\u0027s a painful letter to receive as bereaved parents are already quite aware of all the milestones they miss.Ms Weller said she had also been wrongly sent a letter in 2015 reminding her to register her daughter\u0027s birth.The blunder in Norfolk is similar to one in Manchester last year when nearly 100 letters were sent to bereaved parents. "},{"url":null,"title":"PIERS MORGAN Harry Meghan brought negative press yourselves","story":"Share this article I suspect this staggeringly privileged multi-millionaire prince\u0027s main worry each morning is instructing his servants in his palatial home as to how he wants his breakfast eggs cooked.But when you marry a Hollywood actress, then unfortunately, this kind of pathetic woe-is-me-me-me attitude often comes with the territory.In the next part of his statement, Harry really upped the pity ante, invoking the memory of his late mother Princess Diana.\u0027My deepest fear is history repeating itself,\u0027 he fumed, \u0027I\u0027ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u0027Wow.I understand why Harry dislikes the press after what happened to his mother, truly I do.Her death must have been incredibly hard for him to take as a 12-year-old boy.But let\u0027s be very clear - the press didn\u0027t kill Diana, a speeding drunk-driver killed Diana.And if she hadn\u0027t recklessly abandoned her usual royal protection officers and drivers, she\u0027d probably still be alive today.         Prince Harry, and Meghan pose with their newborn son Archie on May 8 this year. The Duke of Sussex accused the press of \u0027bullying\u0027 and \u0027relentless propaganda\u0027Yes, she was the subject of huge press attention, but speaking from personal experience as a newspaper editor at the time, I can assure you she played the media game just as ruthlessly as we played it with her.She was the biggest star in the world, and would happily and regularly collude with the papers when it suited her – just as Meghan happily and regularly colludes with magazines like People and Vogue when it suits her.But with all due respect to Ms Markle, she\u0027s not in the same league as Diana in terms of fame.So for Harry to compare them in this way is both wrong and slightly distasteful. (And before the inevitable howls of \u0027you\u0027ve no idea what it\u0027s like to lose a parent young\u0027 pour in, let me just point out that my father died when I was very young.)         Meghan was guest editor of September\u0027s Vogue, dedicating it to 15 \u0027fearless women,\u0027 including Jane Fonda, Jacinda Ardern and Greta ThunbergHe added that he has been \u0027witness to her private suffering for too long\u0027 and \u0027to stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.\u0027Hmmm.It was only a few weeks ago that Meghan was telling people at a function that she never reads any press about herself. So how would she know what the press is saying, let alone suffer from it?As I\u0027ve often said, I have little time for Meghan after she ghosted me as a friend the moment she first met Harry. It signified a worrying social-climbing character trait that has seen her ditch many friends and almost all her family if she feels they may threaten her ferociously ambitious rise up the celebrity ladder.But what I think of her personally is irrelevant to the situation that actually sparked this battle with the media, and that is the breakdown of her relationship with her father.There\u0027s no doubt that Thomas Markle made a big mistake in stunting photos with the paparazzi before his daughter\u0027s wedding, as he has admitted himself.But did that really warrant him being banished forever in such a heartless manner?It\u0027s utterly extraordinary that Harry has never met his father-in-law, and that Meghan has now cut him out of her life.         Harry referenced his mother Princess Diana in his statement: \u0027My deepest fear is history repeating itself,\u0027 he fumed, \u0027I\u0027ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u0027 He is seen above with her and Prince William I\u0027ve interviewed Thomas several times and found him to be a very normal and nice, if naïve, guy who just had no idea how to handle the massive vicarious fame that instantly came his way after Meghan announced she was engaged to a British Prince.Rather then help him, they savagely punished him for a silly mistake, and his erratic behaviour ever since suggests a father deeply hurt and bemused by losing any contact with the daughter he brought up with such love and care.Thomas Markle gave Meghan\u0027s letter to the Mail on Sunday because he wanted to correct what he believed was misleading criticism of him in People magazine from Meghan\u0027s friends.Judge him all you like for it, but imagine how tough the past few years have been for him too? He has never even met his own grandchild.Thomas has been no angel in this family wrangle, but nor is he the devil.And he should be allowed the freedom of speech to defend himself.Rather than going to war with the press in this absurd manner, Harry should clamber down off his hysterical hothead high horse and repair the real running sore causing Meghan\u0027s distress – by making peace with her father. "},{"url":null,"title":"Filthy house covered rubbish faeces starving cats resorted cannibalism survive","story":"Share this article          It is thought up to 10 cats had been left so hungry they resorted to eating the bodies of their companions to survive         Beales and High, who now live in Barrow-in-Furness, avoided jail after admitting two animal welfare offences at Liverpool Magistrates\u0027 CourtBeales and High had reportedly moved out in the days prior, and their landlord was so stunned by the state of the house he called Merseyside Police on May 1. RSPCA Inspector Claire Fisher visited the disgusting property and was told the pair had taken the surviving cats with them to a new home.

It is a beautiful fit and of the finest of wool.’Mum wore the suit when she accompanied David to Buckingham Palace to receive his Companion of Honour from the Queen. She could have had champagne but chose tea instead.On another occasion she was given pearls from the Emperor of Japan but they were too heavy to wear on her ageing, thin frame.         Kenneth Hockney, David and John\u0027s father wa a telegraph boy, pictured Visits to meet the famous kept her alive, with something to look forward to. The actor Vincent Price, an avid art collector, was among those who came to Bradford and had tea with her at what she called her ‘humble house’.And in Los Angeles, where David has long had a home, she met stars including Michael Caine, who asked her how she liked Hollywood. Her answer was: ‘Nobody seems to hang their washing out, Michael.’My parents would once only have dreamed of meeting such people and visiting such places, and it seems a pity that Dad, who died in 1977, wasn’t there to share it all too, especially as his philosophy of life did so much to inspire David.Born in Bradford in 1904, Dad grew up in a family open to life as it came. Grandpa Hockney was a former farm labourer who ran a tripe shop and later became a pharmacist’s assistant.For him and my grandmother there was no religion, no regular attendance at church and, unlike my mother’s teetotal parents, both members of the Salvation Army, they partook of alcohol regularly.By the time they finally married in 1903 they already had three children and Dad, who arrived the following year, was the first to be born in wedlock.From his mother, he acquired both the genetic deafness which he has passed on to all of us, and a lovable eccentricity.When unannounced visitors called, Grandma Hockney excused herself, saying ‘I’ll just change my dress’, returning in a new dress pulled over the one she already had on.Dad, who loved Laurel and Hardy and Charlie Chaplin, liked wearing a clip-on bow tie to which he affixed brightly coloured stationery dots to add colour to his world.‘Never worry what the neighbours think,’ was his favourite advice and David took it to heart.As an art student in the 1950s he was oblivious to the comments made when, wearing a bowler hat, long red scarf and duffle coat, and spats over his shoes, he transported his canvases and easels around our neighbourhood in an old pram. My brother Paul refused to walk with him, but I loved how he dressed.Proclaiming his homosexuality in 1962, long before the word ‘gay’ was used in that context, David isn’t afraid to stand up for what he thinks is right, as our father did before him.         David Hockney, pictured with his mother Laura, often used his parents as inspiration for his workAs a young man, Dad was persuaded by a friend to attend a talk given by an evangelist preacher. His words moved Dad to accept Jesus that day, and he met my mother when he began helping out with her Sunday School classes at Eastbrook Methodist Mission.After marrying in 1929, they set up home at 61 Steadman Terracea two-bedroom terrace house with an outside lavatory. It stood at the top of a steep hill that was murder to climb while pushing a pram, as my mother soon was, with five children arriving at two-yearly intervals: Paul in 1931, Philip in 1933, Margaret in 1935 and David and I in 1937 and 1939.Dad had been bright enough to go on to further education but, with his older brother Willie away fighting in World War I, creating a void in the family budget, Grandma Hockney had insisted he leave school.His quick mind for figures and handwriting skills soon won him a job as accounts clerk at a large grocery store, sitting on a high stool in a Dickensian one-man office, huddled over a sloping desk and scribing daily figures.We always thought him so important having an office to himself, but his talents were best put to use outside work.Long before high-viz jackets were commonly worn, he made armbands out of orange fluorescent material so he could be seen at night when crossing the road. He was often laughed at but never worried what people thought.Always late for everything, he resorted to wearing two watches, one set fast, but still he was never on time because he forgot which watch was correct.Eventually he decided to wear only one watch and wrote to Fattorini’s, the Bradford jewellers, asking them to set it ‘to gain rather than be accurate’. They refused.This was one of myriad letters he penned. Another was to the local Morrison’s supermarket manager, praising the perforation marks of Izal toilet rolls.‘They always tear to perfection,’ he enthused.         Hockney\u0027s 1957 study of Tunwell Lane, in Eccleshill, pictured, where the family moved in 1943He also corresponded with world leaders on humanitarian matters. In a letter to the Pope, Dad asked him to sell the solid-gold telephone on his bedside table and give the money to the poor of Mexico. And he fought so long and hard against capital punishment that in 1965 he was invited to Parliament to see the act to abolish hanging go through in person.According to David’s fellow students at art college, he talked proudly about that honour and the replies and Christmas cards Dad received from statesmen such as Gandhi, Khrushchev, Nixon and the Archbishop of Canterbury.Dad’s letters often expressed his pacifist views, formed after seeing his brother return from World War I retching and coughing continually from the effects of gas poisoning.After seeing combat in the trenches and mates dying in front of him, Willie was a shell of his old jovial self and from then on my father was an avowed peace campaigner.When World War II broke out, he registered as a conscientious objector. In years to come, David would do the same, completing his National Service by working in hospitals instead of in the Forces.For Dad, the result was that he was tormented verbally and physically by work colleagues and also faced bitterness at home, a neighbour painting the word ‘Coward’ on our wall every night. Every morning, Dad rose early to wash it off before going to work.         In 1977 Hockney completed this work, My Parents, featuring Laura and Kenneth HockneyIn 1943, to avoid further confrontations, we moved to a three- storey house with a cellar at 18 Hutton Terrace, Eccleshill, a village on the outskirts of Bradford. It is now 77 years since David and I began sharing our attic bedroom there, sleeping in two hospital-type beds placed one against each wall. The floral lino was cold on our feet in winter but a couple of grey army blankets kept us warm.Dad’s loving goodnight was complemented with ‘chin pie’, a rub of his stubbly chin on our soft cheeks, and he painted sunrises on the doors to brighten our lives during the long summer evenings when a blackout curtain blocked the light from outside.OF course, back then, I had no perception that David was to become one of the greatest artists of the 21st century. To satisfy his need to draw during wartime, when paper was unaffordable at least for our family, he woke first, quietly creeping downstairs and drawing on the white edge of Dad’s newspaper, Mum’s magazine or whatever else arrived that day.For family members, there was gentle irritation that their newspaper or comic had been interfered with, and once read it was thrown away or used to light the fire — complete with David’s sketches.Eager to draw at any time, he carried a pencil in his pocket when we went to chapel and used the blank pages at the back and front of hymn books to draw on.When he won a scholarship to Bradford Grammar School in 1948, he had to wear a second-hand blazer, the Hockneys’ financial situation having become disastrous when, soon after VE Day, Dad was fired for his pacifist beliefs. These had been tolerated only while he was needed and he no longer was, made surplus to requirements by returning soldiers needing jobs, and the invention of the mechanical calculator.To make ends meet, Dad had begun refurbishing babies’ prams and making new dolls’ prams, and as we had no home telephone, the advertisements he placed in the local newspaper required interested clients to ring a local phone box between 9am and 11am on Saturdays.Each week, Dad heaved an armchair onto his back, carried it up to the phone box and sat outside waiting for calls, nonchalantly reading the newspaper and directing any approaching member of the public to the next box a short way away.Each of the prams featured decorative lines painted by Dad with a long sable brush, and David was mesmerised by how straight they were and how, with a twist of his hand, Dad created a perfect serif.At the grammar school, art, being regarded as purely recreational, was restricted to one-and-a-half hours a week.Promising students were forced to drop it altogether, so David deliberately failed academic subjects, once refusing to hand in an essay as his English homework and vowing not to waste time on sports.He allegedly won a cross-country race, to general surprise, but was disqualified when a master travelling on a bus spotted him riding a bicycle part of the way. He wasn’t ashamed, his opposition to sport giving him more time to draw.Only in his final year at school did David begin intense study of English, History and other subjects. This stood him in good stead for his transfer to Bradford College of Art — and while there he found an early critic in my father, whose portrait he wanted to submit to an exhibition in Leeds.During the sitting, Dad had positioned a mirror so he could see what David was painting and he commented on his choice of colours as he went along. ‘I don’t think that’s right, not for the cheeks,’ he would say, but David assured him it was how they were taught at art school and he was vindicated when, on the first day of the exhibition, My Father sold for £10 — a fortnight’s wages for its subject.Later awarded the rare distinction of a gold medal at the Royal College of Art, he was soon regarded as someone to watch, getting his first one-man show in 1963. That was at a gallery in London which promised him sales of £600 a year, twice what our father earned, but David has never pursued wealth for wealth’s sake. He pursues art and only a selfish person can be so devoted to it.By ‘selfish’ I mean that for David to achieve what he needs to explore at any given time, he must nurture every minute in that pursuit. Nothing else matters.On a visit to America in 1964 he bought a second-hand Ford Falcon convertible in New York, filled it with petrol and drove to California.He loved the sunshine, swimming pools, minimal clothing and warm, balmy days. With light and a brightness that made colours vibrate, California was the exact opposite of Bradford’s overcast gloom and an ecstatic David had soon bought a house in the Hollywood Hills.The first time I visited him there, he took our mother and me to Christmas lunch at the home of director John Schlesinger, and we shared New Year with actordirector Tony Richardson and his daughter Natasha.On subsequent visits, singer Tony Bennett and his daughter Antonia joined us for Christmas Day at David’s beach house in Malibu. But although he knew exciting people, I sensed a sadness in his invitations to join him for Christmas in LA in the late Seventies and early Eighties.‘I wish my arms stretched to Los Angeles, you need a hug,’ I would say, knowing he was sometimes lonely.Although he still had homes in both LA and London, the 1990s found him spending increasing amounts of time in the seaside town of Bridlington, Yorkshire, where our mother had moved to live with our sister Margaret.Margaret had a large house across from the promenade and David would drive from London to visit them.Each visit he would stay a bit longer, and after Mum’s death in 1999 he moved into Margaret’s house and she moved to a small bungalow near by.In December 2012 I rang from my home in Australia to wish him Happy Christmas and realised I couldn’t make out what he was saying. As he had been teetotal since having a heart attack in 1990, I knew he wasn’t drunk so I emailed Margaret to ask if he was well. She told me he’d had a stroke in November and she wasn’t to tell anyone.I flew back to see for myself. By the time I arrived, David had begun drawing again.It was a blessing. He has always said that life will be finished for him if he cannot use his hands, and he’ll no doubt be drawing and painting until his final day.

Rae Ritchie looks at why getting the right answer is so addictive, and why getting the wrong answer can be so funnyWhat Q is one of the nation’s favourite pastimes? Nope, it’s not quidditch. It’s quizzes. We love racking our brains for that obscure bit of knowledge that we’re sure we once heard somewhere. Whether we are in the pub with our mates or at home shouting at the television, the feeling of getting an answer right is addictive. But why do we find quizzes so compelling?A buzz from the buzzerThe very nature of a quiz lures us in. As veteran question writer David Bodycombe observes: “If a question is posed, you can’t help but wonder what the answer is.”When we get the answer correct, various factors make us want to go back for more. Michelle Tolfrey, a clinical psychologist and member of the Welldoing.org community of therapists, explains: “Physiologically, when we win something, we experience a nice hit of dopamine, which can be quite a euphoric and ‘buzzy’ feeling to have. As a result, we may want to replicate this again and again to get the same sensation.”Tolfrey also points out the psychological rewards involved in quizzes. “They can be particularly enjoyable if we are doing them in the context of socialising with peers, where it can help us to feel connected with others and part of something special.“And there are, of course, lots of other social rewards involved with quizzes, such as receiving praise from others or being given a certain title, prize or accolade that boosts our self esteem.”Fellow clinical psychologist and Welldoing.org therapist Patapia Tzotzoli agrees that quizzes can meet basic human needs. “People are creatures of emotion and are motivated by pride and vanity,” she says. “Quizzes offer a platform where our knowledge is being assessed by our ability to retrieve information quickly while others are watching. Doing so offers us quick gratification and a sense of achievement that nourishes our self-esteem and gains us immediate recognition.“In other words, quizzes offer a setting with the right conditions to feed our need to be important and appreciated for it.”But if quizzes are so rewarding, why do our brains seem to crack under the pressure of needing to come up with the right answer – and quickly?“Sometimes anxiety kicks in and interferes with our memory – and consequently our performance,” states Tzotzoli. “The more anxious we become, the harder it is to remember the information we are after and we experience what we commonly describe as our ‘mind going blank’.”Not quite the answerTimes when a contestant’s mind goes awry make for comedy gold on quiz programmes. On the iconic 80s and 90s show Blockbusters, for instance, participants still had “mind going blank” moments despite being given the first letter of the answer. When asked by legendary host Bob Holness “What D, rhyming with a synonym for defraud, means to decrease in number or grow smaller in size?”, quizzer Susie somehow managed to come up with shrink (correct answer: dwindle, rhymes with swindle).At other times, contestants stuck to the right letter, but under the pressure of studio lights, got the wrong word. After answering “What O is the generic word for any living animal or plant, including bacteria or viruses?”, a young man cringed when he realised that he’d replied orgasm not organism. Contestant Pauline looked even more mortified when the penny dropped that the response to “What K is a Chinese ceremony of abasement?” was kowtow – not Kama Sutra.More such moments follow on the new series of Blockbusters that’s about to hit our screens on Comedy Central. Host Dara Ó Briain is met with laughable responses to questions including “What Q is a type of pen that is made from a bird’s feather” and “What N are potatoes when they first come into season?” No, the answers are not quail and nugget.As in the original, this latest incarnation features student contestants, although a celebrity special with Strictly Come Dancing’s Stacey Dooley and Oti Mabuse against comedian Josh Widdecombe starts the series off.For us armchair quizzers joining in from our sofas, the Blockbusters style of question has major appeal. As Bodycombe puts it: “It’s a clever format because there’s a clue inherently built into the question, which automatically makes you think you might have a chance of getting it right.”Bodycombe is spot-on. No matter how smart, we all need a little help. Just try to distinguish between organism and orgasm.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3169ecc41d3ec20850bbf74c75bb61522702e6cc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e20e9b2e1ddadc4b6ae43646f32c744e","title":"question are two heads really better than one","story":"Blockbusters, the classic gameshow that pits two players against one, is returning for a second series. So in quizzes – and indeed life – do you get the best results working in a team or flying solo? Abi Smith unpicks the scienceHow good are you at quizzes? Go on, you can be honest. You think you’re pretty good, right? Well, you might have a superior intellect – but then again, you might just be overconfident. “This is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, which states that the majority of people tend to overestimate their abilities,” says Matt Shaw, a performance psychologist at coaching company InnerDrive.“Interestingly, this is more pronounced in those with the lowest ability, such as inexperienced players,” says Shaw. “Experts tend to underestimate their abilities, which is sometimes called ‘the burden of expertise’.”Knowing whether you are the type of person who is burdened with expert knowledge or likely to overegg your skills is the kind of insight that would come in handy when playing Blockbusters – the classic TV gameshow that pits a single player against a team of two students.Recently relaunched on Comedy Central with comedian Dara Ó Briain presiding, the game sees contestants making their way across the iconic hexagon-filled game board, answering questions that begin with a particular letter of the alphabet. The format rewards general knowledge, lateral thinking, quick reactions and – in the case of the paired-up players – teamwork.“It’s really important that you choose your thinking partner wisely,” says Robert Ritchie, who’s made a career by cultivating positive mindsets and behaviours across different types of teams.Currently head of organisational development at the University of Salford, Ritchie says “one head is better than two” in the idea-creation stages. After that, he says, you can deliberately decide who to bring in and when. “In a quiz format, that process is accelerated. You have to have that initial moment of reaction and decision on your own, otherwise you’ll only ever be going around consensus or groupthink,” he adds. Get the right teammate and gameplay can be dazzlingly swift: just check out this pair of Cambridge students trouncing their single opponent.Intriguingly, however, two heads are likely to be better than one even if you’re not both Blockbusting naturals. “There is a quirky phenomenon called the Köhler effect,” says Shaw. “This is when working with other people, the weaker teammate tends to elevate their performance. Not only do people work harder if their partner is outperforming them, they are also more motivated when they know that the team’s performance relies on them. This is more prominent when team members’ abilities are similar, like in a quiz.” It’s perhaps no surprise, therefore, that across the two Comedy Central series of Blockbusters, 11 out of 20 have been won by the pair – despite pairs requiring one more correct answer each round than the solo players.Question setter Charlotte Hazzard, who runs the quiz at the historic Grapes pub in Limehouse, London, also believes that two heads are better than one. “When you’ve got two brains, you’re able to pull on a greater bank of knowledge, and pub quizzes often need quite a wide spread of general knowledge,” she says.Knowing the information and having it ready at the right moment are two very different skills, however. Team player Philip fell foul of this when asked: “What U is something designed for both men and women?” His immediate response – underwear – was factually correct but not what the question was looking for. The word Ó Briain wanted, of course, was unisex.There’s a reason that the first answer that comes into your head won’t necessarily win you points, according to Shaw. “Gut responses are essentially shortcuts that help us make decisions quickly and when under pressure. However, they’re not always accurate. Under stress or pressure (like in a quiz), our focus can become too narrow, meaning we stop searching for alternative answers, which can lead to mistakes,” he says.Comedian Josh Widdicombe learned this to his cost on the celebrity edition when he buzzed in too soon on a question about West End musicals, proffering West Side Story as his W answer. This allowed professional dancer and presenter Oti Mabuse to swoop in with the correct response – Wicked – and salvage the point for herself and her presenter teammate, Stacey Dooley.Sometimes though, one head is all it takes. “At the end of the day, if you go with your gut instinct and get it incorrect, you’re more forgiving of yourself than if you hadn’t gone with your gut,” says Hazzard, whose quiz is often frequented by the leaseholder of the Grapes pub, Sir Ian McKellen. The other benefit of going it alone is that you don’t need to negotiate the politics of playing in a team. In one of many Blockbuster bust-ups, teammates Manreet and Nyah disagreed on the choice of letter and subsequently lost a point, with Manreet jokingly defecting to their opponent’s side. So, are two heads really better than one? It depends on the problem and the people – and whether you can keep playing nice.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893da5cdc3ec1deff5552379302619933196e9ca/0_0_10417_6250/master/10417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5912083babaa3d15b02a00c5a18ba515","title":"quiz revival of the fittest","story":"Blockbusters is back.

Jess Phillips, fresh from taking on the “bullies” in the House of Commons, reveals how to speak Truth to Power, while Philip Pullman shows us how Lyra handles adulthood in The Secret Commonwealth. With 426 hardbacks published today, the number is down on last year’s 544.

Here are 10 of the titles booksellers are betting on to bring them a happy Christmas.This standalone novel from the author of Me Before You is inspired by a true story. Englishwoman Alice Wright marries a wealthy American and moves to the stuffy world of 1930s Baileyville, Kentucky. There, she meets the daughter of a felon who is on a mission to spread the wonder of books, and needs Alice’s help.The first collection of short stories from the award-winning author of White Teeth moves from the tale of an Antiguan immigrant in north-west London in the summer of 1959 to a moral panic in the upper echelons of New York.The second volume of Pullman’s Book of Dust trilogy is set 20 years after the first. Lyra is now an adult, and she and Malcolm travel from Oxford to Asia as they search for a city haunted by daemons and try to solve the mystery of Dust.This memoir moves from the comedian’s early years as one of seven siblings in the midlands, where his parents moved from Jamaica, to his appearances on stage in working men’s clubs and Black Country discotheques – and then an invitation to a television audition.In a book subtitled “Seven Ways to Call Time on BS”, the Labour MP writes about her own experiences of speaking up and making a difference, and interviews the “accidental heroes” who have risked everything to fight back.The Poirot actor looks back over his 50-year career in this mix of photobook and memoir, chronicled by Suchet with his ever-present camera. “Look at me: I’m short, stocky, slightly overweight, deep of voice, passionate, darkhaired, olive skinned, hardly your typical Englishman. What chance did I have, going into the world of British theatre?”The other half of Wham! tells the story of how he and George Michael first met as teenagers in Watford in 1975, and formed the band that created the soundtrack of the 80s.In a book subtitled “A Guide for Occupants”, Bryson explores how the human body functions and how it heals itself. “We spend our whole lives in one body and yet most of us have practically no idea how it works and what goes on inside it. The idea of the book is simply to try to understand the extraordinary contraption that is us,” he writes.William Trundle and the extraordinary Christmasaurus are back. Here, they meet the magical Winter Witch, who controls time in order to allow Santa to travel around the world on Christmas Eve.The Suede frontman tells the story of the band, as well as exploring his relationship with addiction, when as a young man he “oscillated between morbid self-reflection and vainglorious narcissism”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cd367d01969c72cfd6b5d1fda0c9e4e03dd0ff2/0_186_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a86698a0c64a6fc72d700ba5ae765883","title":"the language of politics is shallow and threadbare says poet laureate simon armitage","story":"Simon Armitage criticised politicians’ use of cliches in a discussion about ‘truth’, this year’s theme for National Poetry DayThe language of politics is so “shallow and threadbare” that it has stopped “feeling like it has any truthfulness at all”, the newly minted poet laureate Simon Armitage has said.Armitage, speaking on a new podcast from National Poetry Day and Michael O’Mara Books to celebrate the event’s 25th anniversary, said that when politicians use cliches it feels like “some kind of screen being erected in front of you”.“One thing we tend to think about politicians is that they use language to get their own way,” he said. “The language of politics becomes very tired very quickly and it stops feeling like it has any truthfulness at all because it is just so shallow and threadbare.”If politicians start speaking personal truths they may find themselves “outside the party line”, he continued, “so they erect these monuments of speech which are very boring … Language becomes a defence mechanism.”Poets, by contrast, said Armitage, “have always felt a responsibility to not use cliches for that very reason they’re emptied of potential. They’re exhausted. You invite fresh thinking by inventing new formulations, new patterns of language.” Armitage was elected poet laureate in May, taking over from previous incumbent Carol Ann Duffy.The theme for the thousands of events due to take place today for National Poetry Day is “truth”. Earlier this year, broadcaster Cerys Matthews put out a call via her BBC radio shows for poems “which touch on a truth that matters to you”. Nominations came in from figures including Ed Balls, who chose WB Yeats’s The Second Coming for the line “things fall apart, the centre cannot hold”, and poet Imtiaz Dharker, who picked Elizabeth Bishop’s villanelle One Art, describing it as a “cleverly constructed lie”. They have now been collected in the anthology, Tell Me the Truth About Life.Susannah Herbert of Forward Arts Foundation, the charity that coordinates National Poetry Day, said the theme was selected “because these days there’s a great hunger for truth – in both public and personal lives – and a great scepticism, too”.“Truth is an apt choice given the devaluation of an objective stance from people in authority, whether it be politicians or multinationals,” said award-winning poet Daljit Nagra. “Poetry helps to cleanse the language after its vowels and syntax have been corrupted for personal gain.”For British-Cypriot poet Anthony Anaxagorou, poetry offers a route beyond the media soundbites that dominate our daily lives. “A poem is happy not knowing anything for certain, whereas news needs to be premised on ‘truth’,” Anaxagorou said. “Poems argue their own logic, they call on their own truth, which needn’t be an empirical one, so in this respect their reach is far more universal.”But the Trinidadian-Scottish poet Vahni Capildeo cautioned that the most urgent concern for poets is “to become instruments of their craft, or to open themselves so that like radios they will pick up blasts, stutters, music, static and (sometimes) news”.“There is no aspect of everyday life that is not at least a little political,” Capildeo added.BBC local radio stations will broadcast 13 new poems inspired by the truths that “illuminate the places we call home”. From a love poem to Sheffield by Warda Yassin, to Oxford poet Timi Amusan’s poem about the safety he found in the city as a child immigrant from Nigeria, poet Ian McMillan said the idea of the initiative was “vital to poetry, because one of the things a poem can do best is give us a sense of place, an idea of home”.“A poem can hone truths until the home truths it tells get to the very essence of the different places we call home. After all, there’s truth and then there’s poetic truth, and that’s the kind of truth our poets are exploring,” he said.“National Poetry Day is a chance to put a collective ear to the ground, hear what really matters to people and share it in a form that everyone can enjoy – verse,” said Herbert. “They say it takes a village to raise a child: maybe the same is true of poetry. It takes a county, a city, an entire country to create a poem.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39b34473fd12bf1ab943a6847a77ad56b818e366/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e30d92de0a8c4c35d5b8ccc5f546639","title":"tesco chief dave lewis ken murphy","story":"Ken Murphy from Walgreens Boots Alliance will take over as retailer’s boss next summerTesco’s chief executive, Dave Lewis, is quitting the retailer after overseeing a five-year turnaround from a financial crisis and accounting scandal that almost shredded the grocer’s blue chip reputation.Lewis, 54, was parachuted in to run the UK’s biggest retailer in 2014 and his departure has come out of the blue. “My decision to step down is a personal one,” said Lewis, who made it clear he did not have another job lined up. “It is all consuming. The business never sleeps. It is 365 days, 247. I want to take some proper time out with my family and recharge my batteries. You pass this way only once.”The former Unilever executive said he had completed a turnaround plan mapped out at the height of the crisis, when the supermarket issued five profits warnings in a year.Lewis said he was leaving the company in a “position of strength”. He will be succeeded next summer by Ken Murphy, a Boots veteran who until recently was the chief commercial officer of its US parent, Walgreens Boots Alliance.Tesco’s chairman, John Allan, said he had accepted Lewis’s resignation with regret. “Dave has done an outstanding job in rebuilding Tesco since 2014 and he continues to have unwavering support from the board,” Allan said.Murphy, an Irishman, studied at University College Cork and qualified as an accountant. Allan described him as a seasoned leader with “deep commercial, marketing and brand experience within retail and wholesale businesses”. He will be paid a basic salary of £1.35m a year. Lewis earned £4.6m last year, with a basic salary of £1.25m and the rest from bonuses and incentive schemes. When Lewis – who earned the nickname “drastic Dave” for cutting jobs as part of his overhaul of Unilever’s UK business – took control the appointment was viewed as a risk because he had no retail experience. But he set about dismantling the old Tesco model, ending its combative dealings with suppliers, lowering prices and improving store standards. He also took the group into wholesale with the controversial £3.7bn take over of cash-and-carry group Booker. Thousands of jobs have also gone at head office and in store management, including a recent cull at Tesco .Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said Lewis had achieved a remarkable turnaround. “Put quite simply he is the bloke that saved Tesco,” said Black.However, the independent retail analyst Nick Bubb questioned why Tesco had chosen another outsider. “What Dave Lewis will do next is unclear but the bigger question is why Tesco overlooked an array of internal candidates and have gone outside and appointed Ken Murphy from Boots (aka ‘Ken who?’) as the new boss,” said Bubb.Lewis told the board he wanted to leave last year and Allan said internal candidates were considered but no one was experienced enough. Charles Wilson, the boss of Booker who was once regarded as the heir apparent, did not want to be considered. Wilson received treatment for throat cancer last year and has since recovered.Murphy would inherit a company with “firm foundations and a competitive, sustainable growth strategy”, Lewis said.Over the next three years, it intends to double the size of its £3.2bn grocery delivery arms by creating automated distribution centres in the back of stores. It will also open another 150 convenience stores. A subscription service for members of its Clubcard loyalty scheme, which gives them discounts in return for a monthly fee, is also being launched."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9ffbb912bba68d15fcf4b4e6f95ae5d11c65ece/0_0_941_582/master/941.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8df4c71e8d330b324a016d90276d8da1 1290w","title":"pop culture tastes democratic candidates","story":"After Pete Buttigieg revealed his affection for Rebel Wilson comedies, what can we learn from the film, music and TV choices of the other presidential possibilities?This is a crucial time for the 2020 Democratic candidates. It’s a crowded field full of big names, and it’s going to take real work and creativity if anyone wants to stand out from the melee. But luckily Pete Buttigieg knows exactly how to do this: by targeting his campaign hard towards fans of Rebel Wilson.In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Buttigieg laid out his pop culture favourites for all the world to see. He watches Rick and Morty to fall asleep, for example, and he’s trying to get on board with Succession, except “I haven’t decided if any of them are good people”. But when asked about the last film he saw theatrically, he stalled before eventually admitting it was Isn’t It Romantic or, as he called it, “That movie where the lady wakes up and she’s in a romantic comedy”.See, Rebel Wilson fans? Pete Buttigieg is just like you. Sure, he might not have known Rebel Wilson’s name, or the film’s name. And he may not have expressed any sort of opinion about the content of the film. But, really, who has? By half-remembering that he went to see a mediocre Rebel Wilson film eight months ago, Buttigieg has only managed to align with himself with the general public. Maybe we all saw Isn’t It Romantic in February and can’t really remember anything about it? How would he know?So know that we know as much about Pete Buttigieg as we could ever hope to know, what about the other candidates? What do their pop culture preferences tell us about them? Let’s find out.In 2016, Joe Biden dropped a Spotify playlist that is full of exactly the sort of music you’d pick if you didn’t actually like music but wanted the world to think that you did. Bruce Springsteen is on there. The Beatles are on there. The Best by Tina Turner is on there. My Way is on there. It’s less a curated playlist and more the results you’d get if you spent half an hour Shazaming in the world’s most dismal karaoke bar. He also once told reporters that he tried to keep up with Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, so clearly the man is not to be trusted.Cory Booker describes himself as “a movie addict”, so it only goes without saying that two of his favourite films are little-known gems Rocky and Star Wars. In other media, Booker earns points for expressing his fondness for Black Mirror – which he watched with Rosario Dawson – but then loses twice as many for putting Michael Jackson songs on a publicly available Spotify playlist in the year 2019.In January, Harris made a web-only video for Stephen Colbert’s late night show, where she claimed that she loved to dance to Check the Rhime by A Tribe called Quest. To prove this, she then danced even though the song wasn’t actually playing, which is something a sociopath would do. She also once claimed that she listened to Tupac at college, and says that My Cousin Vinny is her favourite film. All her choices, in all media, come from between 1991 and 1993. The woman lives in the past. She’s the Uncle Rico of the 2020 presidential race.Beto’s music we all know about, because he never shuts up about it. He was in a band with one of At the Drive-In, and once made a widely respected DC Hardcore playlist. But what of his other pop culture touchstones? This is much harder to ascertain. In a TV interview in June, he said that he preferred Ryan Gosling to Ryan Reynolds, so let’s assume he’s a big fan of The Notebook.The good thing about Bernie having progressed to the latter stages of a leadership race once before is that he’s already been run through the pop culture mill. There isn’t a thing about his tastes that we don’t already know. Favourite music? He has all of Beethoven’s symphonies on his iPad, but he also likes Abba. He claims that he likes Modern Family and in 2016 called The Big Short an “excellent film” which isn’t much of a surprise, at least.Elizabeth Warren likes Ballers. Doesn’t matter about anything else – doesn’t matter about the music she listens to or the books she reads or the policies she endorses – because she likes Ballers. She’s spoken on podcasts about her love of Ballers. She commented on the 2017 WGA negotiations by telling everyone how much she likes Ballers. She tweets to The Rock about her love of Ballers. Warren has no political motivation to say that she likes Ballers. There isn’t a hidden army of Ballers fans who’ll carry her to the White House if she panders to them enough. She just likes Ballers. She’s the only person in the world who likes Ballers. A woman who can stick up for something as patently rubbish as Ballers deserves to be given the world on a plate.

If fashion channels the mood of the times, it is striking when a house whose exclusive logo-stamped luggage has made it a global byword for aspirational living declares the past a more appealing reference than the future.Especially when the designer is Nicolas Ghesquière, whose mood boards are usually a blend of science fiction costumes, Japanese anime motifs and landmarks of modernist architecture.The collection was a love letter to a postcard version of Paris: the age of Folies Bergère and the Eiffel Tower, curlicued lamps on the banks of the Seine and art nouveau metro signs.Ghesquière said he wanted to explore “dandyism, and those particular snobberies that would later become what is known as French elegance”. The clothes channelled the mood music of Paris at its most charming, rather than being literal in their retro-reference.Ghesquière’s futuristic clothes tend to be what is referred to politely, in fashion-speak, as “costume-adjacent”, but this collection was extremely wearable and immediately desirable.High-waisted, wide-legged trousers were worn with silk blouses layered under tailored blazers. Belted trench coats and clean-lined shifts were worn with block-heeled loafers or moccasins.Handbags were timelessly elegant – and even sensibly sized, rather than minuscule – with graceful top handles. The show took place in a courtyard of the Louvre, where a vast video screen showed Scottish musician Sophie, who chooses not to disclose a gender identity, performing It’s Okay to Cry, a song described in a  review as “a power ballad about an identity-based struggle … hideous and heartrending, an overacted meditation on self-acceptance that could easily prompt real tears”.In a blockbuster commercial evening, this was the only nod to the alternative aesthetic leanings for which Ghesquière is usually known. Louis Vuitton was valued in May at $39.3bn (£32bn), putting it well ahead of Chanel, its closest competitor – and it is getting bigger.This year, the brand has had a series of major perfume launches, while ambitious plans for a greater slice of the “hard luxury” market, in watches and fine jewellery, are next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7765e034c028571b7b2d51309af27215253e7b40/0_0_1862_1197/master/1862.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3b969e6b6c89210686e2c419ef3ba265 2020w","title":"how to cook the perfect apple and blackberry pie recipe felicity cloake","story":"Apples bulk up the berries in this quintessentially British pie that sings of autumnIf there’s anything more seasonal than an apple pie, it’s an apple and blackberry pie, described by Tamasin Day-Lewis as the autumn pie, while Nigel Slater reckons it’s “almost impossible to think of a dish that so accurately expresses the glories of the British countryside in autumn”. Few can fail to have bittersweet memories of past tangles with thorny brambles – one for the mouth, one for the bag – and though it takes a dedicated picker to amass enough to feed a family, they make a happy pair with their seasonal bedfellow, the apple, helping even the most meagre of harvests to stretch a little further. If you’re lucky enough to have a glut, freeze them to enjoy this recipe throughout the winter.The perennially sensible Jane Grigson writes in her Fruit Book that, “when you pick blackberries in the autumn, and gather windfall apples to make this pie, quantity and variety of fruit do not much come into it. You make the best of what you have. This is the way it should be.”Though flavours do indeed differ, this can easily be adjusted with sugar and lemon juice, but the texture of cooking apples is very different from that of dessert varieties. While bramleys break down into a jammy paste when heated, eating apples tend to keep their shape, especially when added to the pie raw, as Day-Lewis suggests. Perfectly pleasant, if time is of the essence, but McMorland Hunter and Hughes cook theirs first, so that the bramleys disintegrate and the dessert apples stay whole but slightly softened. This feels like the best of both worlds: the pureed apples adding moisture while filling the cavity of the pie, and the chunks of dessert apple offering a contrast in texture to the soft berries and bramleys.Grigson, interestingly, takes a very different approach, cooking down half the blackberries with the apple peels, cores and a generous helping of sugar to produce a fruity syrup that she then pours over the remaining raw fruit. It’s delicious, but only suitable for a plate pie, rather than one encased in pastry, because it makes the filling very liquid.If you do have time to cook the apples, my testers and I all like Leigh’s approach of frying them in butter and sugar, which adds richness to the filling, and McMorland Hunter and Hughes’ splash of brandy. Neither rather decadent addition is strictly necessary, but both are delicious if you happen to have them to hand.Slater dusts his apples with a mere sprinkling of sugar, because he likes them “fairly tart”, but he tells readers with a sweeter tooth to heap on “anything up to a tablespoon per apple”. This is a sensible approach – after all, apples, as well as tastes, vary greatly – but however much you add, I’d recommend going for a brown sugar. We find McMorland Hunter and Hughes’ dark muscovado too intensely treacley, but the caramel flavour of Day-Lewis’ demerara or light muscovado works wonderfully with the sharpness of the apple.Everyone uses shortcrust of some variety, and mostly plain, though seeing as Grigson is non-specific, I go for crisp paté sucrée on her pie. A sweet filling, however, seems to me to demand a more savoury enclosure – Slater keeps it light and crumbly with a lard and butter mixture, but we’re sold on Leigh’s softer, yolk-enriched recipe. This is a pudding, after all.Surprisingly, only a couple of the recipes line the dish with pastry before adding the fruit. In my opinion, a plate pie doesn’t offer a robust enough ratio of pastry to fruit here, but as Leigh notes, “it is a challenge to cook the bottom crust properly: it needs a lot of heat from below, and a fair bit of time”, so it’s worth heating a baking sheet in the oven first to help with this. Sprinkle the top with sugar for extra crunch and, like Slater, you may find yourself moved to wave a little flag in honour of this national treasure.2 cooking apples4 crisp, sharp eating apples Juice of 1 lemon25g butter3 tbsp demerara sugar, or to taste1 tbsp brandy or rum (optional)300g blackberries, or however many you have1 splash milkFor the pastry350g plain flour, plus extra for dusting1 pinch salt200g cold butter2 eggsFirst make the pastry. Mix the flour and salt in a large bowl. Grate in the butter, then rub it in with your fingertips until it looks like damp sand.Separate the eggs, and set aside one white for later (give the other one to the dog, make a tiny meringue, or freeze it for bigger meringues another day), stir in the yolks, followed by just enough cold water to bring the mixture together into a smooth dough four tablespoons should do it, but add it gradually.Pinch off about a third and form both lots of pastry into a disc or rectangle, depending on the shape of your dish. Wrap well and chill for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, peel, core and thickly slice the apples and sprinkle with lemon juice.Heat the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat and add the apples, two tablespoons of the sugar and the alcohol, if using, then fry for about five minutes, until they’ve started to soften. Add the blackberries, turn off the heat and leave to cool completely.Heat the oven and a baking sheet to 200C (fan 180C)390F390Fgas 6 and on a lightly floured surface roll, out the larger piece of pastry to about 5mm thick. Use this to line the base and side of a greased pie dish about 24cm wide, leaving an overhang around the edge, then spoon in the cooled filling.Roll out the second piece of pastry. Beat the reserved egg white with the splash of milk, brush this all around the rim of the pastry lining the dish, then lay the lid on top, pressing together the two pieces of pastry all around the rim to seal trim off any excess (if you like, you can roll this again and cut into shapes to stick on top).Brush the top with more of the egg white and milk mixture, sprinkle with the remaining sugar and cut two holes in the top to allow the steam to escape. Bake on the heated baking sheet for 25 minutes, then turn down the heat to 180C (fan 160C)350F350Fgas 4 and bake for another 20-25 minutes, until golden. Leave to cool slightly before serving with thick cream or hot custard.• Is apple and blackberry pie the king of autumnal desserts, or do you have another contender for the crown?

Telford is confident they will perform better than they did in their post-World Cup, but pre-season, friendlies against Belgium and Norway – where they salvaged a 3-3 draw and suffered a 2-1 defeat respectively.“When we came back from the World Cup we were all doom and gloom, we totally messed up,” said the 32-year-old on Wednesday. “When I got back, I was getting my hair done and the woman next to me was like: ‘Me and my husband and the boys stayed up and watched every game. You were brilliant. I don’t like football but I watched you girls, you were fantastic.’“It was so weird. For us we had failed. But everyone else was like ‘yous were amazing’. I just couldn’t get my head around it. Everyone was so complimentary. I think it’s because for the first time 11.7 million have seen what the Lionesses were about and that was the difference. It’s not a small minority, it’s people that have never watched us before, really stood up and said ‘actually, I like the way this team plays’. Not the way the girls play, the way the team plays, that’s nice, people bought into the team regardless of our gender.“We can make excuses, it was a bit of a World Cup hangover, I think we haven’t got a great track record after major tournaments, it’s always really bitty. But I think the difference now is that everyone is a few weeks into their seasons, everyone’s got that competitive edge back.“You put three years of effort into six weeks and the mental overload of ‘we’re going to win, we’re going to win’, and OK, you don’t fall at the first hurdle, you’re out in the semis, but then it’s ‘OK we’re going to get bronze’, and then you come out with nothing. I think you don’t realise how much that hits you.”As well as being better mentally prepared for this camp, the physical difference is “huge”, according to Telford. “They send us on about 100 tours so you’re not even in the country for pre-season … and then you get sent on your national camp and pack your bags again and you’re off travelling. When does it stop? You’re just in this cycle, you feel like you’re a hamster on a wheel and then you get off and you’re on a wheel again.”“I think that taste at the World Cup was like a drug, you don’t want to give it up. You thrive off it, the crowd, the moment the feeling. Stood there it’s just brilliant. I think for me that was my big mindset change, that’s an experience I don’t want to give up and it makes you fight harder and puts you in a new space and a new place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edf871b5998594b82078c321314405c8dd0f4cd4/0_147_3554_2132/master/3554.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=978bc7985f4c05839526ceb179fdf1b7","title":"liverpool rb salzburg champions league match report","story":"Jürgen Klopp had predicted a wild night and found little pleasure in being proved right. By the end, the victorious Liverpool manager sported a face like thunder while his beaten counterpart, Jesse Marsch, indulged in fist-pump celebrations in front of the Salzburg supporters. At least Mohamed Salah stuck to the script.The Egypt international struck the 17th and 18th European goals of his Liverpool career as the European champions survived a stirring Salzburg comeback to kickstart the defence of their title. Salah’s first of the night swept Liverpool into a three-goal lead after 36 minutes. Klopp’s warning about the threat and adventure of the Austrian champions appeared the product of an overactive imagination at that stage. Liverpool were dominant, then unhinged by Marsch’s switch to a midfield diamond. Their defence was easily overrun by a visiting attack led with finesse and guile by Hwang Hee-chan. By the hour the lead had gone. Erling Haaland emerged from the bench to draw Salzburg level. Marsch cavorted down the touchline like a young José Mourinho at Old Trafford. Salah’s second restored a sense of European order and Liverpool’s superiority, though not Salzburg’s exuberant post-match celebrations.Klopp’s introduction of James Milner for Jordan Henderson, and into a more defensive midfield role than the captain, helped Liverpool halt the recovery and the flow of Salzburg attacks. The mature reaction to blowing a three-goal cushion underlined the expertise of a European champion and the final stages passed without trouble. Salzburg’s fightback and the unease it spread throughout the Liverpool defence, however, will have concerned the winning manager.“It was far away from being a perfect game but it was a typical Liverpool game, very exciting and never over until the final whistle,” said Klopp. “I thought after the final whistle that I was angry but then I realised I wasn’t angry. I respect the performance of the opponent and we did some good things in the game. We can do better and we will do better.”Liverpool looked confidently on course for a 23rd consecutive home game without defeat in Europe following their first incisive attack. Salzburg’s four-man midfield was prised apart ruthlessly in the opening half hour with the hosts revelling in the space down both flanks. The appearance would prove deceptive but there was no doubting the quality and control of the Liverpool performance as they sauntered into a commanding lead.Sadio Mané began the scoring when Andy Robertson found him unmarked on the left, a recurring theme, and the striker drifted inside Rasmus Kristensen before exchanging passes with Roberto Firmino. The return ball from the Brazilian was, as usual, perfectly weighted and the former Salzburg player slipped a confident finish past the advancing Cican Stankovic. Mané’s celebrations were restrained against the club where he scored 45 goals in 87 appearances. Not so Robertson’s when he scored for only the second time in a Liverpool shirt. The Scotland captain was the one Liverpool defender to meet his usual standards and rewarded with an excellent goal at the end of a move he instigated. Robertson, like Mane for the opener, drifted inside the Salzburg midfield without resistance. Henderson released Trent Alexander-Arnold and the left-back continued his run to the near post where he met the right-back’s low delivery with a precise side-foot finish. It was his first Liverpool goal since May 2018 and the presence of a left-back inside Salzburg’s six-yard box demonstrated the range of attacking threats unleashed by Klopp.Liverpool were in the comfort zone when Salah made it three with just over a third of the game gone, converting from close range after Stankovic dealt weakly with Firmino’s close-range header. Too comfortable for their own good, it transpired.Napoli, the Group E leaders, were held to a goalless draw at\u0026nbspGenk. Carlo Ancelotti’s side –\u0026nbspwho beat Liverpool 2-0 at home\u0026nbspin their opening match – had started brightly in Belgium, but were not able to find a breakthrough as Genk recovered from their 6-2 thrashing in Salzburg.Borussia Dortmund\u0026nbspwon 2-0 at\u0026nbspSlavia Prague, with two goals from the full-back Achraf Hakimi, to put Dortmund top of Group F on goal difference. Stanislav Tecl had squandered the chance to equalise in the second half when through on goal, only to shoot into the side netting before Hakimi sealed victory with another well-taken late effort.In Group G,\u0026nbspZenit St Petersburg\u0026nbspbeat\u0026nbspBenfica\u0026nbsp3-1 at home to top the table. Artem Dzyuba put them ahead in the 22nd minute, with an own goal from Rúben Dias given following a VAR review and Sardar Azmoun’s solo effort wrapping things up. Raúl De Tomás scored a late consolation.Memphis Depay was on target as\u0026nbspLyon\u0026nbspwon 2-0 at\u0026nbspRB Leipzig, with Martin Terrier also scoring in the second half.\u0026nbspPA MediaSalzburg had threatened in flashes but unnerved the Liverpool defence and Joe Gomez in particular whenever they broke in numbers. The comeback commenced shortly before the interval when Henderson’s pass was intercepted and Enock Mwepu released the highly impressive Hwang into the area. The striker’s first touch took him away from Gomez, then he cut back inside Virgil van Dijk and beat Adrián with an emphatic finish. Liverpool, and Anfield, grew increasingly edgy.They squandered several inviting openings before Hwang crossed for the equally impressive Takumi Minamino to steer a fine volley past the Liverpool keeper. Salzburg’s celebrations were enhanced by the introduction of Haaland, the prolific young striker who was left out of the starting lineup due to illness. Three minutes later, to the shock of Klopp and delight of the striker’s father Alfie, looking on, he drew the Austrians level. Hwang and Mwepu combined to release Minamino and his low cross sailed beyond Van Dijk and Gomez. The unmarked Haaland tapped into an empty net.It fell to Salah to dig Liverpool out of trouble. Dominik Szoboszlai, too hesitant throughout, was beaten to a clearance by Fabinho and Firmino teed up his fellow striker with an intelligent header into the area. Salah exploded on to the opportunity and gave Stankovic no chance with the finish. Liverpool departed relieved and reprieved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d45b16f83f5330da19e4a51b2f549b1bf1e275b9/0_0_5568_3712/master/5568.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb73e18e2ceca398bd30d7d9a5d15b60 880w","title":"conservative party conference five things we learned","story":"Boris Johnson makes a play for the NHS but confusion reigns over Brexit planIn recent weeks Boris Johnson has ramped up his hospital visits and is making a naked play for it to be his top domestic policy beyond Brexit. It is also a way to directly encroach on Labour’s turf should there be an election. He began conference claiming 40 new hospitals would be built in the next 10 years and ended the four-day event by dedicating a sizeable chunk of his speech to the NHS. He described it as “holy to the people of this country” and got cheers from the conference floor when he said: “It is time for us to say loud and clear we are the party of the NHS.”His play to become the face of Tory investment in health, despite Theresa May being responsible for the increase in funding, is wrapped up in his renewed push to present himself as a one nation Conservative. Meanwhile, the party chairman, James Cleverly, twice infuriated Labour politicians when he claimed at fringe events that it was in fact the Tories who founded the NHS, via the efforts of Sir Henry Willnick, a Tory MP who made suggestions for a form of nationalised health service in 1944.The home secretary, Priti Patel, delivered the most hardline and rightwing of all the speeches during conference as she careered through pledges on tougher jail sentences for sex offenders, more Tasers for officers, stamping out “evil” county lines drug gangs with a fresh £20m investment and pausing for dramatic effect with her warning to criminals: “We are coming after you.” The biggest applause was reserved for her pledge to end free movement once and for all and repeating the pre-announced introduction of an Australian-style immigration system. She also appeared to be enjoying her much seized-upon line: “This daughter of immigrants needs no lectures from the north London liberal elite.” This felt odd considering the prime minister, Boris Johnson, lived in Islington until a few years ago and his strategist Dominic Cummings is still a resident.The secrecy around the prime minister’s Brexit plan was painfully clear when even his cabinet ministers were unable to field questions on the subject in a series of awkward interviews. The security minister and former party chairman Brandon Lewis was ripped apart by BBC Newsnight’s Emily Maitlis for not being able to give details on Johnson’s final offer to the EU, or explain how the government might deliver Brexit on 31 October. The leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, was uncharacteristically coy on Channel 4 News on Tuesday when asked about Johnson’s Brexit offer to the EU, saying: “I am yet to hear the final details.”The international trade secretary, Liz Truss, made the shrewdest move when asked about how the government could get around the Benn Act, the legislation that blocks a no-deal Brexit. She said she was sure the prime minister, Rees-Mogg and Michael Gove, the cabinet minister for no-deal planning, had “got it covered”.The DUP was once again the centre of attention and its conference event, a reception entitled Together for the United Kingdom, was the hottest ticket in town on Tuesday night. The lively event had all the hubris of the DUP’s 2017 Tory conference party event, held just months after it signed the confidence and supply agreement to prop up Theresa May’s government. Its sudden announcement that it backed the prime minister’s final offer to the EU on replacing the backstop set tongues wagging.After heavily resisting any alignment with the EU on customs, the DUP now appears willing to accept Johnson’s complex-sounding border solution that would keep Northern Ireland tied to Brussels regulation until 2025. The leader, Arlene Foster, said it was time to get a deal done, prompting speculation that it is the DUP’s own fear of a potential Jeremy Corbyn government that has secured fresh cooperation with the Tories.Johnson made great efforts to present himself as a softer, kinder, one nation Tory throughout the conference. We were to frame his hardline Brexit stance as an aberration to get Brexit done, he suggested. He even told the BBC’s Nick Robinson that he was still the same “generous-hearted, loving, caring” person he had been when he was mayor of London.However, the Brexit-backing, free-market Thatcherite wing was heavily in attendance at this year’s conference with scores of younger members – mostly besuited and with heavy use of Instagram and Twitter – a noticeable presence at fringe events and parties. The Institute for Economic Affairs events were packed and standing room only, while the IEA’s joint party with the Taxpayers Alliance was a giddy affair with guests including Rees-Mogg and the pro-Brexit former minister Penny Mordaunt. The free-marketeer Truss was stopped for selfies everywhere she went."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9b5ac300f9fadec2a33f9c1e87be04648976813/0_72_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e377d522f87b730b9a5c0906e6da93ed","title":"tell us if you have applied for welfare and benefit payments online","story":"We would like to hear about any difficulties you have experienced negotiating computer and IT systems while making a welfare or benefit claimPublic authorities are using robots, algorithms and machine learning to assess welfare and benefit claims, but the systems are often hidden inside a ‘black box’, away from public scrutiny.

Together they make up the only known intact library from antiquity, with the majority of the collection now preserved in a museum in Naples.The villa in which they were found is thought to have been owned by the father-in-law of Julius Caesar, the Roman dictator who was assassinated in 44BC.Experts have attempted to unroll about half of the scrolls through various methods over the years, although some have been destroyed in the process and experts say unrolling and exposing the writing to the air results in the ink fading.Seales and his team have previously used high-energy x-rays to “virtually unravel” a 1,700 year old Hebrew parchment found in the holy ark of a synagogue in En-Gedi in Israel, revealing it to contain text from the biblical book of Leviticus.However, while the En-Gedi scroll contained a metal-based ink which shows up in x-ray data, the inks used on the Herculaneum scrolls are thought to be carbon-based, made using charcoal or soot, meaning there is no obvious contrast between the writing and the papyrus in x-ray scans.While ink in some Herculaneum fragments has been found to contain lead, Seales says it is only trace amounts and does not allow the inside of the scrolls to be read using x-ray data alone. Seales says it has also proved impossible to replicate findings that letters within Herculaneum scrolls can be deciphered by the naked eye from scans captured by a slightly different x-ray technique. As a result the team have come up with a new approach that uses high-energy x-rays together with a type of artificial intelligence known as machine learning. The method uses photographs of scroll fragments with writing visible to the naked eye. These are used to teach machine learning algorithms where ink is expected to be in x-ray scans of the same fragments, collected using a number of techniques.The idea is that the system will pick out and learn subtle differences between inked and blank areas in the x-ray scans, such as differences in the structure of papyrus fibres. Once trained on the fragments, it is hoped the system can be used with data from the intact scrolls to reveal the text within.Seales said the team have just finished collecting the x-ray data and are training their algorithms, adding that they will apply the system on the scrolls in the coming months.As for what the scrolls contain, the researchers say they are excited.Another possibility is that the scrolls might contain Latin text. While classical libraries are believed to have had a Greek section and a Latin section, only a small proportion of scrolls from Herculaneum have so far been found to be in Latin, with the possibility there is a Latin section within the villa yet to be excavated.Dr Dirk Obbink, a papyrologist and classicist at the University of Oxford who has been involved in training the team’s algorithms, said the project was immensely exciting and agreed it is possible the text might turn out to be Latin. “A new historical work by Seneca the Elder was discovered among the unidentified Herculaneum papyri only last year, thus showing what uncontemplated rarities remain to be discovered there,” he said,But Obbink is hoping the scrolls might even contain lost works, such as poems by Sappho or the treatise Mark Antony wrote on his own drunkenness. “I would very much like to be able to read that one,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e37963faafe693bd6fbf63ab7d985c12542f2dc9/0_167_5204_3122/master/5204.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd9118a2948628f1348db563e88408dd","title":"best laid plans flexible rugby world cup","story":"Jamie Joseph, Japan’s head coach, talked about planning for the Ireland game over two years ago. Eddie Jones took England on tour to Italy in July and August to have a dry run for the big show in Japan and the red rose also played short turnaround fixtures to replicate what they would face in the real thing. Planning doesn’t often get the headlines but it is crucial to deliver the foundations of the performances you want and with the four semi-finalists, by the end of the World Cup, playing a total of seven games in various destinations at various times of the day, you need to have done more than just your due diligence.Now we are beginning to get to the pointy end of the group stage, comfort gained from confidence that the route planned is the right one is crucial. It is an area of high performance I love.You rarely hear coaches after a great victory talking poetically about how they managed their weekly schedule but they, along with the ever expanding backroom staff, will have spent an inordinate amount of time on the detail. It is an expanding field within elite sport and while we often read how British Cycling and other Olympic sports have used this side of medal hunting, in rugby it has become a fast accelerating tool to maximise.You need to get big and mini peaks right both for teams and players. The change in the Premiership – with play-offs replacing first past the post – began to embed this deeper in the English game. Peaking all the time isn’t possible but at the right time – that’s the art with the science.Sports medicine and science departments are all common in the top teams and even 10 years ago that was not the case. Normally a keen physio with an eye on technology or a conditioner ahead of the curve covered it but now it is deep and detailed.Big-ticket understanding of flights, accommodation and recovery facilities as well as tournament venues will all have been recced in detail. Underneath that the jet lag protocols will be in place and by now, normal circadian service should have been resumed.Travel within a country, especially in Japan, needs to be orchestrated perfectly. Leave training a few minutes later than you wanted in the floating world of Tokyo and you could easily double your travel time, causing a domino effect for the rest of your day. A game week needs to have the right balance of exertion and workload for everyone to match the goals for a particular game.Within all that are the smaller parts of planning around the types of meals and nutrition to aid sleep, energy and recovery, the balance between coach and player-led meetings and time together and time off as well as the local nuances that could significantly knock you off the road you have planned to travel.Research and then application of humidity strategy will have been put into action. Sweat can be analysed as well as players regularly given osmolarity testing and weighing in and out to make sure they are hydrated. Saline drips would give all players the best chance of getting their essential minerals back and hydration up but that would be breaking Wada rules, so a slower method is needed to get the players back to their best.Games still seem to be affected by humidity and slippery match balls. As an aside I genuinely wonder how much of that is the use of new match balls. Unused balls will have a waxy layer and most groundstaff around the world know that, so normally those balls are thrown in the washing machine and then kicked and passed around a bit before they reach the match. In planning, you always assume nothing but I do wonder if this simple practice has slipped the net thus far.A phrase coined by a 19th-century Prussian military commander – “no plan survives first contact with the enemy” – is true to the extent that a planning structure that can bend in the breeze has to be in place but not to the point that you level it all after an unexpected loss or a performance that dipped to depths you didn’t see coming. Unless the major supporting beams of your planning are wrong or even not present then the mantra “plan your work and work your plan” still needs to be applied.Of course teams along their road to winning have had some potholes to navigate around in those stratagems.The All Blacks’ 2011 fly-half decimation – where injury took their first three and led to their fourth choice being brought in and kicking the winning penalty in the final – was just one example. It provided threats to their goals but their overarching plans were in place and they stuck to their frameworks and protocols.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterOften teams throw the baby out with the bath water after a debilitating loss but Australia, South Africa and Ireland, if they are to buck that unbeaten trend, need to sway but not snap the blueprints they have put in place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fe7a238b12a70d17e3f1332ff0c3e44ee990b19/161_251_4141_2484/master/4141.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30144348893f2143e526d4a6585354cc","title":"dina asher smith wins world 200m golg world athletics championships","story":"Not so long ago Dina Asher-Smith studied history. Now, with each thunderous stride on the track, she makes it. And on a balmy desert night she summoned up a performance of shock and awe to become the first British female sprinter to win a world championship title.This was not so much a race as a 91-step exhibition of Asher-Smith’s staggering athletic talents. The usual rocketing start. Then a bend so geometrically perfect it could have been drawn by a compass. And, finally, grace and power right to the finish. Long before she crossed the line in 21.88 sec – a time that lowered her own national record – gold was in the bag.Then, after a little jig of joy, the scale of her accomplishment began to hit, and her eyes began to water. “Normally I am so chatty and full of energy, but I am lost for words,” she said. “Everybody keeps saying world champion, world title, but it hasn’t sunk in and honestly I don’t think it ever will. I have dreamed of this and now it’s real.”Such was Asher-Smith’s symphony of destruction that her nearest rivals, the US silver medallist Brittany Brown, who ran 22.22sec, and the Swiss athlete Mujinga Kambundji, who claimed bronze in 22.51, were barely in her slipstream. The champagne, however, will be put on ice until after the 4x100m relay final on Saturday.It is 15 years since Asher-Smith was persuaded to do her first cross-country race at primary school and hated it. Halfway round she nearly stopped – only for her parents to promise her an ice cream if she kept going. She ended up finishing fifth out of 400 and a glorious track and field career was born.After Wednesday night’s win she paid tribute to her coach, John Blackie, who has known her since she was eight – and knew, even then, that she was a little bit special. “I wasn’t the fastest when I was younger, but I worked so hard with my coach John,” she said, smiling. “That we’re champions together means so much to me.”There were also the warmest of words for her father, Winston, and her mother, Julie, who have proudly followed her journey through windswept local athletics tracks to arenas around the world. “My mum and dad have been to every single one. English schools. National athletics league. Junior competitions. All the way through to the world championships and Olympics.”She knows that next year’s Olympics will be tougher – especially as the world’s best 200m runner, Shaunae Miller-Uibo, was unable to compete here because of scheduling clashes with her favourite event, the 400m. But Asher-Smith’s achievements in Doha should not be played down. Her 200m time was so fast it would have won 13 of the 17 world championships.“Obviously you want to run in front of a stacked field but at the same time a world title is a world title,” said Asher-Smith, who looked back to her first moment on the world stage when she won 200m and 4x100m relay golds at the European Junior Championships in 2013.“I would say to that Dina, just go and do well because you’re never going to be as nervous as you are right then and now. I even thought about that tonight. When I started to get a bit nervous I reminded myself that I was never going to be that young, unprepared or inexperienced again.”And, whisper it, there could yet be a second British gold medal on Thursday as Katarina Johnson-Thompson leads the heptathlon by 96 points after four events. True, she is still a significant underdog against the reigning Olympic and world champion, Nafi Thiam. But the Briton has certainly done enough to make her great rival sweat overnight after posting her best-ever first-day score of 4,138 points.Johnson-Thompson made a superb start, running a personal best of 13.09sec in the 100m hurdles and following it up with a 1.95m high jump. But it was the shot put, so long her bete noire, where she really struck a significant blow. After two throws that barely scraped over 12 metres, suddenly all the moving parts clicked as she threw her final attempt 13.86m – an enormous personal best by 71cm. No wonder there was a fist pump and a smile. A season’s best 23.08sec in the 200m ensured she ended day one with a healthy lead.The question now is can she maintain it in the long jump, javelin and 800m? If she can match her personal bests in those events she will score over 7,000 – and that might be too much even for the great Thiam. “That’s a great day,” Johnson-Thompson said. “I’ve got another day to negotiate tomorrow but I’m in a good position.”Elsewhere Laura Muir got her 1500m off to a reliably solid start, with no sign of the calf tear that had kept her off the track from late July to early September, as she cruised through her opening heat. However the reigning world indoor hurdle champion, Andrew Pozzi, was unable to put an injury-hit season behind him as he crashed out of the 110m hurdles after finishing fifth in his semi-final. He could only watch as the American Grant Holloway produced a shock in the final, winning gold in 13.10sec after the Jamaican Omar McLeod tripped."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55398479dcb2134f7d016a70eb229608fae50be8/132_127_2127_1276/master/2127.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b76e99e90bf90333c8be763a7ca67dc6","title":"england rugby world cup wisemantel george argentina boring","story":"No Rugby World Cup would be complete without an opponent taking a potshot at England’s “boring” style at some stage. Like the first cuckoo of spring it is simply a matter of who and when and the Argentinian hooker Agustín Creevy’s pre-match comments about the “dull” English must have amused, among others, the former Wallaby winger David Campese.Never mind that Eddie Jones’s side have so far scored 11 tries in two games and are less reliant on their rolling maul as a strike weapon than the Pumas. While parts of Creevy’s thesis seem to have been lost in translation, his remarks have not impressed England’s attack coach, Scott Wisemantel, who suggests this particular “cliche” and the truth are two different things.Wisemantel knows from personal experience how easy it is to make casual assumptions, having joined the red rose camp expecting the squad to be “predominantly public-school based” and far less erse than is actually the case. While England do favour a structured game, he points out that a third of their tries at this World Cup have come from unstructured situations.“I know we have good players and multiple threats so maybe it is a way for other people to pigeonhole us,” said the Australian. “I think it is a cliche. Look at the chances we probably let slip in the Tonga game. If we had taken those everyone would say: ‘Wow, that is exciting.’ Against the US I thought there were some brilliant bits of open-field rugby but it’s always a balance. Look at every team in this competition that is going OK and their set piece is solid.”•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterCreevy does have some first-hand experience of English preferences having spent two seasons at Worcester, where Wisemantel – “He might just have been at a boring club” – may now have to buy all his own drinks for the foreseeable future. Wisemantel, though, reckons Creevy’s unflattering opinion is based on evidence which is now past its use-by date. “He obviously hasn’t been watching much of the Premiership. There are some excellent teams with so many different styles.”England’s first-choice hooker, Jamie George, also feels there is more to this current side than some of their critics give them credit for. “I don’t think we do play boring rugby,” said George. “I’m not overly surprised he’s tried to say that but he’s entitled to his opinion and hopefully we will prove him wrong on Saturday. I’m sure he’s just trying to rattle us a bit. He’s more than welcome to try.”It all helps to stoke the fire in the buildup to Saturday’s game, to which England are eagerly looking forward. Beat Argentina and they will be guaranteed a place in the last eight, which Wisemantel says would be fair reward for their months of training-ground graft this year. “These guys, to a man, are the hardest-working group I have ever worked with,” said Wisemantel, who has coached all over the world. “Jeez, they come in and work hard.”Among those keen to help his side do their talking on the field is Maro Itoje, who has so far come up against every major nation in the world bar Argentina. “They are very passionate, a very proud nation, they have a strong forward pack, a strong lineout, a strong scrum, and very dynamic backs. It is the type of game I love playing.”This will also be the first time England have played outdoors at this tournament, having previously operated under a closed roof in both Sapporo and Kobe. While the ball is still likely to be slippery, George has taken good-humoured issue with his scrum-half Willi Heinz for claiming England’s big sweaty forwards are making the situation worse. “Just look at how shiny his head gets,” countered George.”He sweats as well, it’s not just us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d3fafd3d937b0739ffdb13df6cd7f57ce25b55b/0_64_2134_1280/master/2134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=649c7c34bd66d193b9ea77e424199eb7","title":"uk athletics pressure alberto salazar","story":"• Usada has concerns about use of prescription medications• Salazar given four-year ban for doping violationsUK Athletics is facing calls for an inquiry into how much influence the banned coach Alberto Salazar, who mentored Mo Farah for more than six years, has had on athletes in its endurance programme.The move comes after the US Anti-Doping Agency, who sanctioned Salazar on Tuesday for “orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct” while working with the Nike Oregon Project, said it also had serious concerns about his use of prescription medications on otherwise healthy athletes.One of those is thyroxin, which UK Anti-Doping believes should be banned in elite sport because it has concerns over potential health risks for heart, skeletal muscle, bones, and metabolic pathways, and is now the subject of a Wada critical review.According to the Times, one leading British coach in Doha has written to the UKA hierarchy calling for an investigation into whether such methods were ever employed by staff in charge of the British Athletics team. On Wednesday the  spoke to two elite GB athletes who shared the coach’s concerns.UKA has declined to comment, but before Salazar’s ban its performance director, Neil Black, called him a “genius” and described his relationship with him as one of “total trust, total belief, total respect”.Travis Tygart, the Usada chief executive, has said that athletes under Salazar’s wing were often kept in the dark about the substances they were given and used as “laboratory animals”. Tygart told the German TV channel ZDF: “You must understand that the athletes really had no idea what was going on with them, what was being given to them. What dosage, whether the methods were forbidden or not, they didn’t even know.Tygart confirmed that 10 athletes from the Oregon Project had helped Usada investigators. “All of them provided us with their medical evaluations. We found out they were fake and false information was added after we officially requested it.“I hope Nike now sees this as a wake-up call. They can’t find any excuses any more, they have to admit that experiments were done on athletes in their name and on their premises, and that was just wrong.”Salazar, who was stripped of his world championships accreditation, continues to deny any wrongdoing and has vowed to appeal. Nike has also backed the coach and said that his four-year ban “had nothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6db119948a98da141d04a1bc166f035b71c3fd8/0_134_2925_1755/master/2925.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dda63d204d9726578517dfe318c076a9","title":"georgia v fiji rugby world cup 2019 live","story":"15 min: No mistake from Matiashvili - although from some angles he really did look to have missed that! Who can say. And remarkably - after the kick judges initially raised their flags we’ve had a conference and the decision is penalty missed! The TMO got involved. Have you ever seen that at World Cup rugby?! We’re back to 0-0 - a big let off from a handy area. He fooled the flaggies, Matiashvili, but not the man upstairs.13 min: They win the jump, but can’t set up the maul. Fiji defend well and get the Georgians on the back foot, but there’s a slightly high tackle from Fiji, and the men in mauve think about a shot at the sticks.12 min: A huge secondary push from Georgia, and the Fijian front row slumps. Penalty, Georgia - and they kick to touch. Big drive opportunity once again.11 min: A loose ball, but ripped by a Fijian hand in the attempted one-on-one strip. A pause with a Georgian down in backplay - it’s been a bruising first opening stanza.We set for the scrum, Georgia’s feed.9 min: The maul is initially stymied, so they swing wide, Georgia. But they run out of real estate and the move is squandered. And now a penalty against Georgia.That rain has now really stepped up - and Fiji try a quick lineout 10m out from their own line, in the wet. You gotta love that.7 min: Penalty to Georgia - no arms in the tackle from Waqaniburuto the skipper. They kick for touch and have the chance at an offensive lineout.5 min: Some gentle rain falling in Osaka, as both sides set for a scrum. This will be interesting - they’ve improved a lot in recent time, the Fijians, but here’s a big test.Georgia feed, win and clear, but no signs of dominance at the set piece from either side. The kick is measured perfectedly, and the chase bundles the Fijian winger into touch to regain possession. Fine play.3 min: It’s Fiji with sustained possession as Botia partially breaks the line, before Yato gets some good metres. They’re about 25m out, Fiji, but it’s been tough defence so far, as you’d expect, from the Georgians.1 min: It’s a first sign of those slippery conditions, but it’s ball backwards for the Fijians, and play on. They spread wide on their first foray ball in hand. A portent of things to come, no doubt.It’s Ben Volavola who boots us off - he sends it deep, and the Georgians, in a fetching mauve jersey, claim comfortably and clear. We set up for an early lineout.So - to live action: our two sides have come out the tunnel, hit the ground, and it’s the Fijians who lead with their Cibi war dance. Lovely stuff.Sheesh, there’s some beards in this Georgian line up. Some battle-worn faces too. They look tough. An interesting quote pre-game about the slippery balls due to the Japanese humidity. Apparently the Georgians have been practising with soap on the balls. Clever.But to team news - all in two handy info-graphics:It’s a return to “full strength” teams from both sides, after both fielded weakened outfits against Uruguay (to differing success).Georgia revert to 12 of the 15 that played Wales, with Lasha Khmaladze, Alexander Todua and the aforementioned Sharikadze returning Fiji return with 13 of the 15 that faced Australia, with Manasa Saulo (who starts instead of Peni Ravai) and Semi Kunatani getting the nod.The big in for the Fijians though is Peceli Yato - the man who gave Australia a torrid time for 50 or so minutes before he was stopped in full flight but a contentious Reece Hodge tackle. Let’s hope he’s firing on all cylinders tonight - what a big in he’ll be for Fiji. Also, if you’ve got the gang together - I’m thinking streamers, decorated rooms, some kind of BBQed meat sizzling away - please let us know. I’d love to hear what you’re all doing today for this crucial Pool D clash. Is is kava o’clock in Suva? Chacha in Tbilisi?For anyone not already in party mood (this is me showing a pre-emptive bias towards the glittering fast feet of Fiji’s backline), I humbly offer the following party-starter.Hi all! The best of greetings to you, from wherever you’re following our coverage today. Are you a Georgian working remotely in the Baltic north trying to warm your heart with good news from Osaka? Or a Fijian backpacking through South America? We love to hear from you - fire us an email or tweet to join the conversation. I’d especially love to hear some brazen pre-game predictions on this one. My heart says Fiji, but my head can’t rule out the strength of the Georgian forwards.After some of the mismatches elsewhere, its fair to say there are no straightforward games in Pool D. Georgia v Fiji may not have earned the headlines of a South Africa v New Zealand or a Australia v Wales, but it could prove to be one of the most decisive pool games. After their shock loss to Uruguay, this is do-or-die time for the hugely talented Fijian squad and their seasoned coaching staff. A 0-3 start is inconceivable - especially after how near they ran Australia. And with a place at the 2023 Rugby World Cup on the line Fiji can’t afford another slip up.For Georgia, conversely back on the winners list after dispatching Los Telos, the dream to aim even higher remains alive - a win could momentarily at least, send them top of the pool. What a final game against Australia that would set up. And their inspirational skipper Merab Sharikadze returns for his first appearance of the tournament.It looms as a drastic clash of styles. Forward v backs. Running rugby v grinding rugby. In rankings, these two are just a scratch below Argentina, and we saw how well Los Pumas pushed France. 11 v 12 - the tier two’s top two, outside hosts Japan. There’s inidual skill to burn and no doubt heart to match. Do. Not. Miss. A. Beat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24743531a1d6b61a170fcf3c033402c45296b2cc/220_50_3756_2254/master/3756.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb3a328d422fe4b69579243d0f887da8","title":"microsoft launches surface pro x and previews folding phone","story":"Product bonanza includes bigger Surface Laptop 3, Surface Earbuds and updated Surface Pro 7Microsoft has launched the Surface Pro X, a redesigned thin and light two-in-one Windows 10 PC running on custom ARM chips rather than traditional Intel processors, plus the Surface Pro 7 and Surface Laptop 3, and previewed a folding phone and dual-screen tablet.The products were unveiled at an event in New York on Wednesday, where Microsoft sought to grab attention from rivals including Apple and Samsung.The Surface Pro X is Microsoft’s next-generation mobile tablet-laptop hybrid. It fits a larger high-resolution 13in screen into the 12in frame of the existing Surface Pro, is only 5.3mm thick at its thinnest point and weighs 762g. It retains the detachable Type Cover keyboard from Microsoft’s existing line, but introduces a new Surface Slim Pen stylus that fits between keyboard and tablet for charging and storage.The biggest change is the use of the Microsoft SQ1 chip instead of Intel chips. The new custom ARM-based processor has an integrated AI engine and was developed with Qualcomm based on mobile device technology but running full Windows 10. Microsoft said the chip is three times more powerful per watt than the processor in the existing Surface Pro 6.“What does that mean? Better battery life, faster, thinner, lighter with unprecedented performance, all while running the full power of Windows, Office, Edge and Chrome,” said Panos Panay, the chief product officer of Microsoft.The new tablet PC also has always-connected 4G, similar to a smartphone, and promises battery life far in excess of traditional Intel computers.The Surface Pro X will start at £999 in the UK and $999 in the US, where it will ship in early November.The Surface Pro 7 will cost from $749 in the US and will ship on 22 October. It will cost £799 in the UK.Microsoft also unveiled updated traditional laptops with a refreshed 13.5in and brand new 15in Surface Laptop 3.The larger 15in Surface Laptop 3 bucks the trend with options for an Ryzen Surface Edition processor made by Intel’s longtime rival AMD, which Microsoft said has the fastest graphics of any laptop in its class.Geoff Blaber of analysts CCS Insight said: “Broadening its silicon partners to include AMD and Qualcomm will inevitably raise eyebrows and cause Intel to look over its shoulder.“The reality is that this is about choice, control and flexibility as Microsoft widens the Surface portfolio to address a growing range of devices and use cases.”Both laptops feature all-day battery life and Microsoft’s new fast-charging technology. They are also repairable, with removable hard drives and other components designed to be easily taken apart.In a clear dig at rival Apple, which has had problems with its laptop keyboards that are difficult to repair, Panay said: “Being able to repair and service a product without impacting the beauty and elegance is critical. Serviceability, repairability, we did things so we can replace the screen or the keyboard without affecting the beauty.”The 13in Surface Laptop 3 costs from $999 and the 15in version costs $1,199 in the US, shipping on 22 October. In the UK it will cost £999 and £1,199.Microsoft also announced a new set of true wireless earbuds, called the Surface Earbuds, which are direct competitors to Apple’s AirPods and Samsung’s Galaxy Buds and join its existing Surface Headphones.The Bluetooth earbuds feature one-clip pairing, multi-device compatibility – meaning they can be used with PCs, phones and tablets from all brands – and have up to 24-hour battery life with a charging case. A dual-mic array in each ear is designed to pick up the user’s voice and cancel the background noise, which was demoed though voice dictation in Office for real-time captions and translation.They also have direct Spotify integration for starting playback without having to reach for the phone on Android, and gesture controls for playback and volume – something missing on many wireless earbuds.The Surface Earbuds will cost $249 later this year in the US.Alongside products due to go on sale this year, Microsoft also took the wraps off two products it is working on for Christmas 2020.The Surface Duo is a two-screen folding phone, which has two 5.6in screens bolted together with a hinge that folds a full 360 degrees. The phone opens like a book then folds all the way round.Microsoft pitched the Surface Duo as having the benefits of a phone, but also a computer on which you can do more because it has two screens. However, with folding devices such as Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, which have one continuous flexible screen that opens like a book instead of two screens bolted together, the Duo may be out of date before it ships.Panay said the firm had partnered with Google to bring Android apps and the Play Store to the Duo, “bringing the absolute best of Microsoft with the absolute best of Google”.“You’re more productive on two screens, much more than one screen can ever be, but it has to be elegant, it has to be robust,” he said, in a vague reference to Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, which has had problems with the robustness of its flexible screen.Microsoft also unveiled the Surface Neo, which it said would be the evolution of its Surface computer line. It too has dual screens, with a hinge in the middle, but will run a new version of Microsoft’s operating system called Windows 10X.The firm said the new device will have a detachable keyboard and can be opened like a book, used as two screens or one, used like a laptop with a virtual trackpad on one screen, or folded all the way over. It also supports the Surface Thin Pen, which attaches to the back of the device, and uses a new Intel chip designed to support dual-screen devices. The Surface Neo will be 5.6mm thick and weigh 655g.“I believe this is the next category to adapt to you in form and function, creating unlimited and interrupted flow,” said Panay.However, neither the Surface Duo or Neo will be available until Christmas 2020. More than a year is a long time in technology.Blaber said: “Surface Duo is a bold new category of device and will take time to build developer and carrier support.“The launch of Surface Duo will inevitably draw comparison with its doomed Windows Phone investments. Duo is not without risk, but Microsoft isn’t trying to repeat history and reinvent the wheel. It’s using an established platform to deliver a new category that is optimised for a Microsoft experience.“This is the start of a journey for Microsoft and expectations should be set accordingly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9be78af2ab0a5366bd504fff57575a17ffe71ddc/147_0_4369_2623/master/4369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca7794067bb7182e5d9690611f9b689d","title":"rupauls drag race uk promises to be grittier than us version","story":"Long-running reality show gets a dirtier, edgier makeover without the US pageantry Fans of RuPaul’s Drag Race should prepare themselves for a British version that is “grittier” than its polished US counterpart, according to the contestants who will try to “shante and sashay” their way to victory when the show starts on Thursday night.RuPaul’s Drag Race, which has run for 11 series in the US and become one of the most successful reality shows of the last decade, has found a home on BBC 3 – where its 10 contestants promise to showcase their unique brand of British drag.Scaredy Kat, a 20-year-old drag queen from Wiltshire, said fans should expect a “dirtier, grittier and edgier version”, while Gothy Kendoll from Leicester said none of the American pageantry would be on display. “We come from a more campy background and it’s all about having a laugh. In the US they’re from a pageant background where it’s more about presenting yourself in a very polished way,” he said.Michelle Visage – one of the show’s judges alongside Alan Carr and Graham Norton – said it had taken five years of negotiations to get Drag Race UK to the screen, with the British version launching before an Australian edition due in 2020.In the build up to the show’s launch its line up has been criticised for not being erse enough – with eight of the 10 drag queens in the show being white. “I’ve had a lot of messages saying ‘it’s not erse, it’s not erse’,” says Vinegar Strokes, who along with Sum Ting Wong are the two drag queens of colour on the show.“I think actually you need to come out of the mindset of skin colour and think, is the cast erse in terms of drag? The UK’s drag scene is smaller compared with the US, so you’re not going to get as many queens of colour. So let’s all chill out and enjoy it,” he said.Wong said the fact there will be some representation on the show should be celebrated. “I feel like it shouldn’t be looked down on it should be celebrated. I don’t want to be on the show because of my Chinese-Vietnamese heritage,” he said.Winning the competition can lead to lucrative careers with previous winners Sasha Velour and Bianca Del Rio, going on to build their own brands. “It’s like Dragon’s Den for drag queens. You go in, show what you can do, and then – hopefully – your fee goes up,” said The Vivienne, a drag queen from Liverpool.A key difference between the US and UK shows will be a lack of arguments between contestants that punctuate the original. Divina De Campo, a veteran drag queen from West Yorkshire, said the best series of Drag Race have been where the contestants have embraced “sisterhood and support”. “It’s not all fighting and cutting up each other’s wigs,” he said.Strokes believes the show is a way for drag to infiltrate the British mainstream again. “I think it has always been in the mainstream, if you look back to Dame Edna and Lily Savage, it’s always been there. But having actual drag queens from the scene pushing it on TV is going to take it to another level.”Asked whether the show should be on a primetime slot, the contestants said Drag Race was still too subversive for 7pm on a Saturday. “It’s one of those shows where you can’t do an Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway version of it. You can’t X Factor drag. It has to be in place where you show what you do rather than being judged by the general public,” said Strokes. “People need to watch and learn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/663859cfb0eadcb3b4d7dda8af6ee6944027c273/0_530_7952_4774/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e21d82148017992f92369160538c4728","title":"tv tonight helen mirren catherine the great four part drama","story":"This four-part drama presents the reign of the 18th-century Russian empress as opulent escapism.

This will lead to wave overtopping, some coastal flooding and damage, especially along western and southern coasts.”Lorenzo is the largest recorded storm to have made it so far east in the north Atlantic.Authorities on Portugal’s Azores islands closed roads, schools and non-emergency public services on Wednesday morning in preparation for winds of up to 100mph (161kmh) and waves of up to 25 metres (82ft).“The situation will worsen in the next few hours,” the head of the regional government, Vasco Cordeiro, told the Portuguese broadcaster SIC.Lorenzo is expected to weaken to an extratropical storm as it moves north towards Ireland and the UK.At a meeting of Ireland’s National Emergency Co-ordination Group, Eoghan Murphy, the housing and planning minister, expressed concern over the storm’s potential impact in coastal areas and the damage from falling trees.The orange warning for Galway, Mayo, Clare, Cork, Kerry and Limerick will be in place from 6pm on Thursday to 3am on Friday. South-westerly winds will reach mean speeds 40 to 50mph, with gusts of 60 to 80mph. A yellow rainfall warning for Ireland will be in place between 9am on Thursday and 9am on Friday.Dan Suri, the chief meteorologist at the UK’s Met Office, said rain and heavy winds would hit western parts of the UK from Thursday, with a risk of coastal gales in Northern Ireland and western Scotland on Thursday, and Wales and south-west England on Friday.In Ireland, a status red warning is the strongest alert, while orange is for conditions that can “impact significantly” on people in affected areas. Yellow is for conditions that do pose threats “only to those exposed to risk by nature of their location andor activity”.Hurricane Lorenzo broke records over the weekend after being elevated to a category 5 storm, which the National Hurricane Center in the US said was the strongest for that far north and east in the Atlantic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80b04851f3f535bfc294bf26e7b7b78e30566220/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40f48d209b4fe688e1d78096810e4e15","title":"christchurch massacre defence lawyers drop request to move trial away from city","story":"Trial of man accused of killing 51 people at two mosques set to begin in June next year The man accused of killing 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand in March has withdrawn an application to have the trial moved away from Christchurch, the city where the attacks occurred.The decision was announced at the high court in Christchurch, where the accused man, Australian Brenton Tarrant, appeared via a video link from a high-security prison in Auckland.Around 80 members of the Muslim community were in attendance, Stuff reported, with many concerned they would not be able to attend the trial if it was moved to another city.Tarrant’s defence lawyer Shane Tait unexpectedly withdrew the application to have the trial venue moved, at a hearing that lasted 10 minutes.Tarrant’s next court appearance is scheduled for 12 December.Tarrant, a suspected white supremacist, pleaded not guilty in June to 92 charges against him, including of murder and terrorism.

According to figures released on Thursday by the North’s department of agriculture, environment and rural affairs, the number of certificates required per year could rise from 18,000 to 1.9 million or more. “The resources and solutions available to us are finite,” said Dr Robert Huey, “and the demand for EHCs may well exceed the supply in a no-deal scenario.” An EHC is an official document signed by a vet or other qualified person to verify a food or animal export meets the health and safety requirements of the importing country. Such a certificate would be required for each food or animal export to the Republic of Ireland or the rest of the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Any inability to process such certificates would lead to delays, increased costs, a reduction in cross-Border trade and job losses in the agri-food sector. “There would be an immediate, severe, negative impact on exports to the Republic of Ireland and the EU,” said Séamus Leheny of the Freight Transport Association. There simply isn’t the personnel to do this, and if trade suddenly stops there is a knock-on effect and job losses not just in agri-food, but among processors, the manufacturing industry, logistics, the service sector. Every single sector will take a hit.” The department of agriculture, environment and rural affairs aims to be able to provide 400,000 certificates per year for meat and dairy exports, and said it was working with the private veterinary sector to help it meet the remaining demand. According to the department, the rise is due to the emergence of a new sector requiring EHCs, food retail and distribution, which will account for approximately 75 per cent of this certification requirement. It said the actual demand “will depend on the ability of businesses to maintain existing patterns of trade given the broad range of third-country requirements they will need to meet if they wish to continue to trade with the EU”. Patterns Dr Huey said “while trading patterns and practices will adjust and the need for all 1.9 million certificates is unlikely to fully materialise, we have planned for the reasonable worst-case scenario in a no-deal scenario. We have scaled up as much as possible but, still, demand may exceed capacity.” In order to cope with the demand, the department said it had reprioritised the work of up to 100 vets, trained around 300 existing staff to operate as trade certification support officers, and has recruited 100 additional administrative staff. It has also provided additional training to enable local councils to increase their capacity to provide EHCs for fish and eggs, and allocated £2 million to support this. “This is an unprecedented time for Northern Ireland’s agri-food sector and a time of great uncertainty,” Dr Huey said. “We have explored, and will continue to explore, every possible avenue to scale up our capacity and that of the private sector, but the resources and solutions available to us are finite and the demand for EHCs may well exceed the supply in a no-deal scenario.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The Government and the European Commission have said they will engage with the British government over the coming days on proposals unveiled by British prime minister Boris Johnson to replace the backstop.However, there is little expectation in either Brussels or Dublin that a deal on the basis of new proposals is remotely possible in the weeks before the Brexit date of October 31st.While the commission and Government here did not want to dismiss the British initiative, highly placed sources agreed it is unrealistic to expect that a new agreement could be struck on the basis of the British submission. Most are of the view that an extension to the October 31st date is likely. Mr Johnson spoke to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker by phone on Wednesday and both men later said they would study the British proposals and continue to talk to London about them. He also spoke to German chancellor Angela Merkel.Dublin is equally keen not to reject the proposals outright. And Government sources said they are a basis for discussions, though not, in their present form, for an agreement. After a phone conversation between Mr Varadkar and Mr Johnson on Wednesday night, sources said the Taoiseach had told the British prime minister the proposals “do not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop”.However, Mr Varadkar undertook to “study them in further detail, and consult with the EU institutions, including the task force and our EU partners”. Customs checksMr Johnson’s proposals, sent to Brussels on Wednesday afternoon, would mean Northern Ireland leaving the EU customs union – the bloc’s tariff-free trading area – but remaining aligned with the EU’s single market rules, the bloc’s uniform set of standards, for all goods including manufactured as well as agricultural and food products.This would mean some checks on products and goods moving between Northern Ireland and the EU, but also customs checks on goods moving across the Border. London says the checks can be mostly conducted electronically, but some checks will still be required – a red line for Dublin. Earlier in the day, Mr Varadkar repeated his pledge not to accept any deal that entailed checks on goods moving between North and South. He also disputed the assertion by Mr Johnson that such checks would be a “technical” matter.“I think it’s much more than a technical issue,” he said. “It’s deeply political, it’s legal and the technical aspects are only a small part of it.”In his closing speech to the Conservative party conference in Manchester, Mr Johnson described his proposal as a compromise for both sides that respects the Belfast Agreement. And he said Britain would leave with no deal if the EU rejects them.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph:  Laura HuttonLeader’s Questions came and went without a reference to Boris or Brexit.Keeping their powder dry on all sides.It was a question of timing. The British prime minister was still on his feet performing his keynote stand-up routine at the Tory Party conference when Leo Varadkar and his opposition counterparts commenced their midday joust in the Dáil chamber.The Taoiseach’s presence was required. But it was interesting to see his Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs present too, as opposed to glued to the television upstairs watching Boris Johnson’s speech. Simon Coveney sat by Leo’s side for well over an hour. For much of the time they were the only cabinet members on the front bench. As the Taoiseach took questions on housing, healthcare and bailed-out banks, a pensive-looking Coveney, fidgety fingers interlocking and steepling, seemed miles away. Would anybody mention the B words? The PM’s knockabout act in Manchester was well finished by the time Leo escaped the chamber. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was already in the canteen, leisurely perusing the hot counter and having the chats.There was an air of calm about the two men in Leinster House. It was as if they weren’t expecting any surprises from across the water, during or after Johnson’s address. Meanwhile, an announcement by Richard Bruton about a major renewable energy collaboration between Ireland and France, which had been scheduled for the Italian Room in Government Buildings, moved up the news agenda. Enterprise Minister Heather Humphreys was now going “to deliver an important message for businesses on financial supports available for Brexit” at this media opportunity.‘Subject to his availability’And then the bit which had the television news crews and political correspondents erting to Merrion Street. “The Taoiseach may also attend subject to his availability.”Who knew there would be such interest – national and international – in the news that the Irish government has been given a big EU grant towards the billion euro “Celtic Interconnector” electricity link? Whatever that might be.The Italian Room went out the window. The Taoiseach’s big-ticket lecterns – three of them – were rolled out in a line at the bottom of the steps in front of Government Buildings, signifying this was not a Richard Bruton gig anymore. Soon after 2pm, ministers Bruton and Humphreys swept down the red-carpeted stairs and through the main doors, flanking the fortuitously available Taoiseach. He took the middle lectern and made the announcement Richard would have made without the drama or audience.Leo declared there is to be a monumental exchange of wind between Ireland and France. Far more wind than has ever been exchanged between Ireland and Britain, which will be very important post-Brexit. “By connecting Ireland’s electricity grid to that of France and continental Europe, it means that when the wind is blowing in Ireland we can export it to the continent and when it is not blowing in Ireland but is blowing in other parts of continental Europe it can be exported to us,” the Taoiseach explained. This Celtic Interconnector is a very expensive piece of engineering. Around a billion, give or take. That’s more than half the cost of the interconnector, he pointed out unnecessarily. Isn’t Europe great all the same? Why, Mr Junker, with all these millions you are spoiling us.Richard Bruton filled in some more detail. At the moment, our energy standby capacity is reliant on the existing interconnection with England. “And it’s smaller – it’s only 500 megawatts and this will be 700 megawatts.” The underwater electricity connection will link Ireland with France and, all going to plan, could be ready in around six years’ time. Once the UK leaves the EU, the interconnector goes too. This Franco-Irish link will hook up Ireland with the EU’s energy market post-Brexit. It represents “solidarity with the rest of the European Union”, said Richard, and will result in cheaper and greener electricity. “I would like to thank all of you who have played such an important part,” said the Minister, including “RTÉ”. What? No wonder they’re talking about having to sell Lyric. He hastily explained the billion-euro project is a joint venture between EirGrid and its French energy counterpart, Réseau de Transport d’Électricité (RTÉ).Get cracking Heather Humphreys then reminded businesses to get cracking before the effects of Brexit take hold, by applying for support funding through the Brexit Loan Scheme – there’s hundreds of millions available in Brexit insulation. Speaking of which (it was the reason the Taoiseach crashed the Richard’s interconnector party), Leo was still coming to terms with the leak of the “non-papers” at the beginning of the week, purporting to outline the UK’s final negotiating position on the Backstop. “Not very promising,” he said.Was there anything in Boris Johnson’s conference speech signalling possible movement? “I actually didn’t have a chance to hear Prime Minister Johnson’s speech. I was in the chamber taking questions myself.” In the chamber with his Foreign Minister beside him. It meant neither of them could comment on the latest Brexit musings emanating from Boris in Manchester. As for the leaks in those non-papers, Leo couldn’t really comment on them either as he didn’t see the non-papers concerned. However, the Fianna Fáil leader winkled out an interesting nugget of information from the Taoiseach during later questions, when few where paying attention. As Leo was sticking by his lack of knowledge of the British position and publicly remaining aloof from the current state of play between the EU and the UK, it transpired he knew a lot more than he was letting on. Had he been given a briefing from Number 10 on the leaked non-papers?“I can confirm that two of prime minister Johnson’s aides visited Dublin and came yesterday morning to Government Buildings, where they gave my officials and advisers a verbal briefing on the UK Government’s proposals,” replied the Taoiseach. He never said that on Tuesday afternoon when the subject was broached in the Dáil. Leo didn’t want to comment on any proposals due from the British “until I have had a chance to see them and study them”.“You know what they are, though,” surmised Micheál.This caper is far from over."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4038253.1570055301!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us to target key irish food and drink brands with 25 tariff","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe tariffs on butter will likely hit Kerrygold, which is the second-most popular butter brand in the United States. More than 34,000 tonnes of the Irish product was exported there in 2018.  File photograph: Getty Irish food and beverage products including Kerrygold and Baileys are to be hit by a new 25 per cent tariff by the United States.The Trump administration unveiled plans to tax EU imports following a WTO ruling on Wednesday.In a blow to Irish and European food exporters, the Office of the US Trade Representative announced it would impose tariffs of 25 per cent on a range of food products including butter, cheese, pork and several drink products, including liqueurs such as Baileys.However, while whiskey from Scotland and Northern Ireland – including Bushmills – will be hit, it appears that Irish whiskey has been exempted from the tariffs.The decision was announced hours after the United States was given the green light to impose $7.5 billion (€6.84 billion) worth of tariffs on European exports.The Geneva-based WTO issued its judgment in the long-running trade dispute, ruling that the United States could impose trade measures worth up to $7.5 billion over what it has said are unfair subsidies given to Airbus.It marks the largest ever ruling by the international trade body.Ireland’s butter and liqueur exporters will be among the businesses affected by the ruling, with the new tariffs due to come into effect on October 18th.Apparent exemptionHowever, the apparent exemption for whiskey from the Republic of Ireland will be welcomed, given that the US is Ireland’s primary export market for whiskey.The tariffs on butter will likely hit Kerrygold, which is the second-most popular butter brand in the United States. More than 34,000 tonnes of the Irish product was exported there in 2018.An analysis by Ibec earlier this year found that Irish goods would be the most exposed, on a per capita basis, to the proposed US tariffs on EU goods, noting that €818 million worth of products would be hit. “Given that the food and drink sector makes up two-thirds of the exports of indigenous firms, there is potential here for significant knock-on impacts on the domestic economy,” the association writes in its most recent economic outlook.‘Big win’Speaking at a press conference in the White House on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said that the WTO ruling was a “big win for the United States”.“The WTO has been much better to us since I’ve been president because they understand they can’t get away with what they’ve been getting away with for so many years, which is ripping off the United States,” he said of the decades-long dispute.The WTO is due to rule on a parallel case brought by the EU against US support for Boeing early next year. The EU has warned that it will be forced to retaliate over the new tariffs.Incoming EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan said during his confirmation hearing in Brussels this week that Europe “has to stand up for itself” and should identify American products that could be hit in retaliatory action if the US imposed the sanctions.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brother of man shot dead by ex-Dallas police officer forgives and hugs her in court - watchElectric cars could pave the way for 80mph limit, Grant Shapps saysPriti Patel to launch new probe into \u0026#39VIP sex ring\u0026#39 investigationUniversity rich list revealed as figures show over 4,000 staff are paid more than £100,000 a year Breastfeed to save the planet, scientists say as study exposes infant formula damage to environmentComment: At last, a PM making the case for capitalism, restoring party pride and reconnecting with votersBoris Johnson\u0026#39s Tory conference speech: one message to party faithful – let\u0026#39s get Brexit doneFrench government struggles to allay health fears after huge chemical factory blaze causes stenchDoc Martin, episode 2 review: this grumpy GP\u0026#39s diagnostic skills are unlike any otherVaping patients had acute lung damage similar to gas poisoningDonald Trump calls impeachment a \u0026#39coup\u0026#39 as Democrats demand documents from White HouseColombian politician jailed for buying votes escapes during dental appointmentPressure on Ireland to back Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Brexit deal as Labour MPs suggest they will help it pass through CommonsStakeknife: files on IRA agent prepared for Public Prosecution ServiceSeven dead, dozens injured as anti-government protests in Iraq turn violent\u0026#39Little progress\u0026#39 for NHS patient safety over past 20 years, says chief inspector of hospitalsComment: Boris\u0026#39s Brexit plan is the real deal: it would be a fatal mistake for the EU to underestimate him nowComment: The EU should not ignore the mutual benefits of the PM’s Brexit offerEngland should follow Scotland and ban smacking of children, says NSPCC chiefDaughter of James Brown defends Sir Desmond Swayne over blackface photographBoris Johnson\u0026#39s Brexit deal does little to break the deathly political slow-dance we are locked in with the EUWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/12/bitcoin-mining-russia.jpg","title":"bitcoin mining russia nuclear scientists cryptocurrency","story":"Subscribe nowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Premium free for 1 monthSee the optionsSarov facility is home to one of Russia\u0027s most powerful computersA nuclear scientist\u0026nbsphas been fined 450,000 rubles (£6,000)\u0026nbspfor illegally mining bitcoin at a top secret facility in Russia, according to local reports.Denis Baykov was one of three scientists at a nuclear laboratory in Sarov – a closed Russian town 400 kilometres from Moscow – who were arrested after they allegedly used an ultra-powerful supercomputer to mine the cryptocurrency.The two other employees are currently awaiting sentencing,\u0026nbspThe Moscow Times\u0026nbspreported, citing the state-run RIA Novosti news agency.Bitcoin mining requires vast amounts of computer processing power in order to solve the complex mathematical problems that are needed to generate new units of the cryptocurrency.The supercomputer used by the scientists has one petaflop of processing power, meaning it is\u0026nbspcapable of conducting up to 1,000 trillion operations per second.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

The fork of bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology spawned a new cryptocurrency: Bitcoin cashTowards the end of 2017, the price of bitcoin surged to almost $20,000. This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearIt is not clear how many bitcoins the scientists were able to mine before being caught, though one of the defendant\u0027s lawyers said they used specialist software to avoid being detected.I can say one thing for sure: they were not detained on the first day they began to mine, he said.They regret what they did, but I think they went for it out of professional interest, not for the purpose of profit.It is not the first time that supercomputers have been illicitly hijacked to mine cryptocurrency.In 2014, a Harvard student used one of the university\u0027s supercomputers to mine dogecoin, while a National Science Foundation researcher also misused US government equipment that year to mine bitcoin.Nuclear scientists were also arrested in Ukraine earlier this year after allegedly using computers to mine for cryptocurrency.In doing so, the Security Service of Ukraine claimed that the scientists had compromised the lab\u0027s secret location by connecting the computers to the internet.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It appears to have been doing so as far as back as 10 billion years ago, when it was just forming, and those faint traces of smaller galaxies can still be seen to this day.Astronomers hope that the research can shed light on how our own galaxy will eventually be swallowed, and how it will come to its end. But it also opens up new mysteries about why and how Andromeda is destroying the galaxies that surround it.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe Milky Way is on a collision course with Andromeda in about four billion years. So knowing what kind of a monster our galaxy is up against is useful in finding out the Milky Way\u0027s ultimate fate, said Dr\u0026nbspMackey\u0026nbspfrom the\u0026nbspAustralian National University\u0027s\u0026nbspResearch School of Astronomy and Astrophysics.Andromeda has a much bigger and more complex stellar halo than the Milky Way, which indicates that it has cannibalised many more galaxies, possibly larger ones.Huge ‘structures’ found floating in spaceTo piece together that ancient story, which is published in the journal\u0026nbspNature, researchers looked at dense clumps of stars that are known as\u0026nbspglobular clusters. Those show the signs of the ancient feasts, during which Andromeda would swallow its closer neighbours.That allowed them to see the fossils of long-dead galaxies, using them to understand the galaxies as they were when they lived, in the same way that fossils on Earth could shed light on ancient lives and deaths.By tracing the faint remains of these smaller galaxies with embedded star clusters, we\u0027ve been able to recreate the way Andromeda drew them in and ultimately enveloped them at the different times, Dr\u0026nbspMackey\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile the study helps answer important questions about the fate of our galaxy, it also opens up new questions and mysteries. Scientists say that Andromeda\u0027s two rounds of feeding came from entirely different directions.This is very weird and suggests that the extragalactic meals are fed from what\u0027s known as the \u0027cosmic web\u0027 of matter that threads the universe, said Professor Lewis from the Sydney Institute for Astronomy and University of Sydney School of Physics, who co-led the study with Dr Mackey.More surprising is the discovery that the direction of the ancient feeding is the same as the bizarre \u0027plane of satellites\u0027, an unexpected alignment of dwarf galaxies orbiting Andromeda.Those planes can be torn up by Andromeda\u0027s own gravity within the space of a few billion years, according to previous research by the same scientists.This deepens the mystery as the plane must be young, but it appears to be aligned with ancient feeding of dwarf galaxies. Maybe this is because of the cosmic web, but really, this is only speculation, Professor Lewis said.We\u0027re going to have to think quite hard to unravel what this is telling us.Astronomers also hope that the discovery could help us to learn more about our own galaxy, and how it will continue to evolve.One of our main motivations in studying astronomy is to understand our place in the Universe. A way of learning about our galaxy is to study others that are similar to it, and try to understand how these systems formed and evolved.\u0026nbspSometimes this can actually be easier than looking at the Milky Way, because we live inside it and that can make certain types of observations quite difficult.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And then it helped him rebuild his image after the journalist’s murder, reports Richard HallThe murder of Jamal Khashoggi was supposed to be quiet. The Saudi officials behind the brutal slaying had planned everything meticulously. He would disappear without a trace.\u0026nbspThe killers wanted nothing to disturb their boss’s ambitious reform drive at home. The young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was trying to transform his country. He had spent the past two years courting the international community as part of his grand vision to modernise the kingdom and attract foreign investment. He gave Saudis new freedoms, but he also cracked down harder than ever on dissent.\u0026nbspHundreds of millions of dollars were spent on promoting the crown prince\u0026nbspand his reforms. A vast global public relations offensive courted world leaders and celebrities.\u0026nbspAnd it appeared to be working – up until Khashoggi disappeared. When it emerged that the dissident journalist had been murdered inside the Saudi consulate, likely on behalf of the crown prince, that carefully crafted image was ruined, and the royal\u0026nbspfound himself in the centre of a global scandal that threatened to derail all of his plans.An army of public relations firms was\u0026nbspnow faced with an impossible task: to save the image of a man whom many now regarded as a brutal murderer. One year on from Khashoggi’s killing, they may just have done it. \u0026nbspThe fallout from the Khashoggi killing was unexpected, but the crown prince’s\u0026nbspvast PR network was already on a war footing when the scandal broke.\u0026nbspA year earlier, the Saudi information ministry announced a global campaign “to promote the changing face of KSA to the rest of the world”. This network of lobbyists and public relations experts had been working furiously to counter bad press from Saudi Arabia’s devastating war in Yemen and its blockade of Qatar. Most of it, however, was working to promote the crown prince.\u0026nbspIn early 2018, the royal embarked on a high-profile media tour of the US –\u0026nbspbilled as a coming out party after assuming de-facto leadership of Saudi Arabia from his father. He held meetings with President Donald Trump, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, Hollywood stars, Wall Street financiers and Oprah Winfrey, to name a few. He appeared on the flagship news programme 60 Minutes\u0026nbspfor a sit-down interview, and attracted faint praise from columnists in\u0026nbspThe New York Times.\u0026nbspThat trip was followed by a similarly loud visit to London. PR agencies took out full-page adverts in national newspapers, and paid for giant billboards across the city announcing the visit. Industry insiders said that campaign could have cost as much as £1m.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

The kingdom also hired a host of London firms, including Consulum, largely staffed by former employees of Bell Pottinger, and Freuds.\u0026nbspThe aim was “to present an image of KSA as striding towards reform, detoxify the government to reduce international political pressure, attract investment for economic growth, and open up foreign tourism”, says Professor Hardy.\u0026nbspBut not everyone was convinced. Many saw the PR push as just that, including Khashoggi himself. Nikita Bernardi, a PR consultant who works on human rights cases in the Middle East, remembers discussing the prince’s plans with Khashoggi. \u0026nbsp“He and I were having this conversation in the days before his killing,” she says. “Almost exactly a year ago I was in Washington DC organising a conference, the aim of which was to question this new face of Saudi Arabia they were trying to promote. Jamal Khashoggi was one of the speakers.”“The PR campaign felt so extremely superficial. It was almost designed for western countries that needed him to look more palatable so that they can continue the status quo and sell arms and the rest of it. They needed him to look like he was changing things in the right direction.”\u0026nbspJamal Khashoggi during a press conference in\u0026nbsp2014. Saudi Arabian officials murdered Khashoggi, a dissident and journalist (AFP)At the very moment Khashoggi was airing his doubts about whether the crown prince was really a true reformer\u0026nbsp– in private and in public – the royal’s top advisers were plotting to kill the journalist.Khashoggi went missing on 2 October after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. He had gone there to collect papers so that he could marry his fiancee, who waited for him outside. He was never seen again.\u0026nbspSaudi Arabia initially insisted that Khashoggi had left the consulate, but after a steady stream of leaks by Turkish investigators, it changed the story, saying the 59-year-old was killed there in a “fist fight”.Turkish and international investigators later said that Khashoggi was murdered inside the consulate and his body disposed of. Agnes Callamard, the UN special rapporteur leading an independent human rights inquiry into the killing, said the murder was “planned and perpetrated by Saudi officials”.\u0026nbspBut the trail of evidence led all the way to the crown prince himself. The CIA and some western countries believe the crown prince ordered the killing – something he has continued to deny.\u0026nbspIn trying to silence Khashoggi, his murderers had the opposite effect. The journalist’s disappearance sparked a firestorm that engulfed the crown prince. Donald Trump, who had been close to the Saudi royal, described the attempts to deny the killing as the “worst in the history of cover-ups.”MBS speaks about his role in the murder of Jamal KhashoggiThe murder derailed the crown prince’s carefully crafted rebrand. In the weeks that followed, as the crown prince was directly accused of involvement, a number of companies and leaders distanced themselves from the kingdom. London-based Freuds and Pagefield Global Counsel announced they were no longer working with the country, in addition to Milltown Partners, which was run by a former head of communications for Prince Charles.PR Week reported that Gladstone Place Partners, Glover Park Group, BGR, Portland Communications, and Gibson, Dunn \u0026amp Crutcher all ended their work for the Saudi government.But though the kingdom lost much of its PR strength, the firms that stuck around “went into overdrive”, Ben Freeman, who tracks foreign influence for the Centre\u0026nbspfor International Policy, told\u0026nbspThe Washington Post.\u0026nbspThose firms included Qorvis Communications, a US-based crisis communications company, and its parent company, MSL, which has worked with the Saudi government for nearly two decades. According to The Washington Post, MSL has received more than $18m from the Saudi government since October 2018.\u0026nbspThe Saudi government also signed a new $120,000-a-month contract with Karv Communications earlier this year, according to the Financial Times, to “enhance the reputation and image” of the country’s Public Investment Fund, which is headed by the crown prince.With the royal under suspicion for the killing, the strategy of the PR firms changed, according to Professor Hardy. The incessant focus on the crown prince\u0026nbspwas replaced by more targeted persuasion.“The Saudi government sent out senior envoys to persuade key figures in media, politics and business of the sincerity of the investigation into the killing, and to carry out slow, discrete work to stabilise and rebuild confidence,” he says. \u0026nbsp“We are currently seeing a multi-pronged effort. KSA is investing in ‘soft power’ influence such as sports and tourism. Efforts to influence wider public perceptions through such things as sports investment have led to the charge of sportswashing,” he says.\u0026nbspProfessor Hardy points to the upcoming boxing rematch between Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz for the world heavyweight title that will be held in the kingdom.\u0026nbspKhashoggi (AFPGetty)On Friday, just days ahead of the anniversary of Khashoggi’s killing, the government announced a new tourist visa programme for 49 countries.\u0026nbspAnd, one year after Khashoggi’s murder, the crown prince is making a return to the spotlight. On Saturday, he\u0026nbspappeared on 60 Minutes again. In the interview, he denied any personal involvement in the killing.\u0026nbsp“This was a heinous crime,” he said. “But I take full responsibility as a leader in Saudi Arabia, especially since it was committed by iniduals working for the Saudi government.”\u0026nbsp“I get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch,” he said.\u0026nbspBernardi, the PR consultant, says the interview marks a new strategy.\u0026nbsp“There is only so much that could have been done to protect his reputation. The damage was so great. In the whole year since Jamal has died you can see how the Saudi story has changed. First it was deny, deny, deny, then they said it was rogue agents, now we have the crown prince saying ‘it happened under my watch’.”That is a very PR line. To me that sounds like something that was thought about and rehearsed. It’s just empty words. What are you taking responsibility for? Absolutely nothing\u0026nbsp“That is a very PR line. To me that sounds like something that was thought about and rehearsed. It’s just empty words. What are you taking responsibility for? Absolutely nothing.”\u0026nbspAgnes Callamard, the UN’s expert on summary executions whose investigation found “credible evidence” linking the crown prince to the murder, told Reuters that his remarks amount to a “strategy of rehabilitation in the face of public outrage around the world”.“He is creating a distance between himself, he is exonerating himself from direct criminal responsibility in the killing. He is creating layers, and layers and layers of actors and institutions, which are protecting him from his direct accountability for the killing.”There are signs, however, that the international community has already moved on from the killing and is perfectly happy to let the crown prince back into the fold. After initially linking the royal to the murder, the Trump administration has made it clear that it would not affect\u0026nbspthe US-Saudi relationship in any meaningful way.\u0026nbspNext year, Saudi Arabia will host the G20 summit in Riyadh, where the crown prince\u0026nbspis likely to take centre stage. But while states will likely continue to do business with Saudi Arabia, it is unlikely that the the royal’s image will ever fully recover.\u0026nbspAFPGetty)“But such attempts have largely been undercut by Saudi Arabia’s ever-worsening human rights record, including the detention and targeting of dissidents, systematic torture, mass executions, and a lack of accountability for Jamal Khashoggi.”“We have seen increasing international pressure on Saudi Arabia, including two landmark joint statements at the UN, a US house resolution and a UK court ruling.“While these measures have not always been sufficiently followed up by respective governments, and clearly much further pressure is needed, the time for business as usual is over.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

She was very clearly expressing she didn’t consent to certain things.“The second real concern is that the court didn’t hear from the woman, partner or her family. There is a serious question ofenough was done to help the woman understand the question.“But the real, real worrying fact in this case is the level of deception they approved in this care plan - it really concerns me.“We can all imagine how distressing and traumatising this would have been for her. The risk seems so high.“Birthrights are really concerned whether the Court of Protection is representing women’s rights.“The judge talks about weighing up risks and probabilities but one of the worrying things is how late in the day this is being discussed, he himself asks why it is coming to court so late.“The level of deception in how to achieve a forced caesarean seems disproportionate, given she then gave birth naturally.“We believe all women have the right to decide what happens in childbirth. This point is really well established in UK law.”At the start of the pregnancy she was in a relationship but living at her home with her mum and spending time at her boyfriends family home.By May she had moved out of her mothers home into a supported living placement.The fact there were no problems stunned the judge, who admitted later it had “confounded” assessments.Making the original ruling Mr Justice Williams admitted: “She is likely to experience distress, distrust, anger, frustration at both the deception that may be necessary and the carrying out of a surgical procedure against her will in respect of such a profoundly important matter.This is likely to be all the greater because it is proposed that the baby will be removed from her care.“The evidence demonstrates she lacks capacity to make decisions as to her antenatal care and the delivery of her baby.“That lack of capacity arises from a learning disability which renders her unable to make a decision because she is unable to understand the information relevant to the decision and to use or weigh that information as part of a process of making a decision.“The overall balance in the evaluation of her best interests is thus in favour of the proposed treatment plan provided it is supplemented to address the psychological or psychiatric consequences of giving birth in this way.“I therefore declare that it is in her best interests to undergo a planned caesarean and the proposed transfer and proposed postnatal care plan.”The papers, which refer to the woman as JP, laid out in full the steps of the proposed treatment by the NHS Trust, whose identity was also hidden.Experts said it was needed because she has learning dficulties and did not have the mental capacity or ability to make decisions about her delivery or her care.She had actually said she did not want a Caesarean and had become agitated during a visit to an antenatal clinic, calling one medic a “b******”.The woman had said she had wanted to do the birth her way and punched a chair when an anaesthetist came to see her.Court documents laid out the drugging plan in full: “JP will be asked to attend hospital in order to conduct monitoring in respect of the baby.This will be a pretext for the carrying out of a planned caesarean section.“I JP agrees to travel to hospital for the monitoring on arrival she will be provided with a sedative, oral midazolam, contained covertly in a drink.When that takes effect she will be taken to theatre where she will be provided with a gas administered general anaesthetic.This might involve some degree of physical restraint. If JP was cooperative a general anaesthetic by IV would be considered.“If JP was not willing to travel to hospital for monitoring she would be given midazolam covertly in a drink at a residential unit.If she was then cooperative she would be transferred to the hospital. If she was not cooperative she would be given an intramuscular injection of ketamine.If necessary she might be physically restrained in order to achieve her transfer to hospital. If necessary a general anaesthetic would be administered at that time in order to effect her transfer.“In theatre the Caesarean section would be performed.”But the day after the Court of Protection hearing, when the ruling was made, she went into labour without any of the disturbing actions having to take place.In fact she had given birth naturally without any issues, according to a postscript to the papers.Mr Justice Williams admitted: “The capacity for iniduals to confound judges assessments is a reminder - to me at least - of the gap between probability and actuality.“I hope JP and the baby are well.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That was Bindi the Jungle Girl.“Then I decided it was time to do other things.“As the family were going to do their own thing, I was doing my thing. We were just on dferent paths.”A year after Steve’s death it was even rumoured that John had a fling with the Crocodile Hunter’s widow Terri.Both have always dismissed the rumours as completely .At the time Terri told New Idea “good luck with that,” adding that her hubby was a hard act to follow.But things within the family have apparently descended into a bitter feud with Steves sister claiming they no longer speak.The close-knit clan once worked alongside the Crocodile Hunter star at the familys Australia Zoo but it all changed after he was killed by a stingray in September .Steves father Bob abruptly left the animal sanctuary shortly two years after the telly star died, but other family members continued working together.Now older sister Joy Muscillo claims Steves widow Terri forced them out three years ago and they are estranged.She claims Terri and her kids, Robert and Bindi, began to distance themselves shortly after Steves death in .Joy says she would have spoken about the rt earlier, but there was a confidentiality agreement forcing her to stay quiet.Since it has now lapsed, Joy spoke out to Daily Mail Australia saying the state of her familys current relationship is very sad.She said: I keep away from all that.

Joy and her adult children, who also worked there, left soon after.Bob, who left the zoo in , has been estranged from Terri and his grandchildren ever since and now lives as a recluse, the Mail reports.Bindi, now , has become a TV star herself, winning Dancing With The Stars in the US in .She has previously shared her views on the family feud and claims her grieving grandad cut himself off from her and her brother.She reportedly said: Everyone deals with grief dferently.When my dad passed away hechose to distance himself from everything that dad loved the most.At the moment were really just respecting his wishes because he hasnt had anything to do with us for a long time and he decided his own path.Bindi even claimed Bob rejected birthday presents from them on one occasion.She said: He opened them up and he sent them back.Meanwhile Steves lookalike son Robert, , has followed his father as a fearless crocodile handler and wildle expert."},{"url":null,"title":"university chiefs paid 100k student debt","story":"The University of Edinburgh was the worst offender, dishing out six figure pay and pension packets to some  members of staff.Across the UK, a whopping , uni execs were paid £, or more, according to the TaxPayer’s Alliance rich list.Out of these, , staff pocketed a massive £, or more.Kieran Neild, from the TaxPayers’ Alliance , blasted vice chancellors for moaning about being poor while doling out big bucks salaries.He raged: These rankings shine a light on the thousands of university administrators taking home very plush pay packets.Taxpayers and students will be left with a degree of uncertainty over whether this is money being well spent, particularly when left-wing professors are so keen to lecture them about the evils of inequality.Instead of constantly complaining about faculty budget cuts, uni bosses need to get their bumper wage bills under control and focus on providing their students with the very best higher education they can.

But in the case of the traditional media, he mustn’t wield the loss of his mother as a weapon to try to shut down valid criticism that questions why, for example, he preaches about climate change one day then climbs aboard a private jet the next.Princess Diana was media savvy and close friends with several influential journalists.In his recent memoir, former Vogue publisher Nicholas Coleridge relayed the story of a lunch they shared that he had gone to great s to keep secret.But as she left, he says four photographers, “sprang forward, taking a thousand snaps”.Another example of “Diana, the hunted” perhaps Later, Coleridge rang a newspaper friend to ask how the picture desk had known and got the reply: “Diana rang herself from her car, on her way to lunch. She often tips them off about where she’ll be.”Equally, on the night of her death, she was safely ensconced in the Paris Ritz but chose, at midnight, to leave in a car being driven by a man three times over the French drink-driving limit.That is not to say the media — and, in particular, the paparazzi — didn’t sometimes step out of line, but unlike her youngest son, Diana knew not to judge all by the actions of a few.Presumably, the Sussexes hope The Mail on Sunday will cave in before it gets to court, but the paper is insisting it will defend the action “vigorously”.If so, Thomas Markle will be the star witness, and potentially Meghan herself — an event that will draw far more publicity to the Duchess’s turbulent family background than any article we have all long forgotten about.During the South Africa tour, Harry told -year-old student Peter Oki he was so overwhelmed by the world’s problems that it was sometimes hard to get out of bed in the mornings.Perhaps he should try embarking on a tour of the UK, where millions of his subjects are coping with issues without the cushion of wealth and privilege he enjoys.Hard-working people who, after the daily grind of keeping their head above water, simply don’t have time to obsess over perceived slights.Of course, there is one sure-fire route to greater privacyHarry and Meghan desire it.Give up the royal title , get a full-time job and pay for your own house renovations, like the rest of us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I want the best for you because I know that’s exactly what Botham would do,” Brandt said on the stand.He added: I love you as a person. I dont wish anything bad on you.Brandt then asked the judge: I dont knowthis is possible, but can I give her a hug The judge said he could, and the pair stood up, met in front of the bench and embraced while Guyger cried.The victims mother Allison said outside court: That  years in prison is  years for her reflection and for her to change her le but there is much more to be done by the city of Dallas,The corruption that we saw during this process must stop and it must stop for you. After now, I leave Dallas but you live in Dallas. and it must stop for everyone.The sentencing was earlier met with boos and jeers by a crowd gathered outside the courtroom.Its a slap in the face, one woman told reporters.As the victims family walked out of the courtroom after the hearing, the group in the hallway began a chant of No justice! No peace!Sherfs deputies then cleared the hallway outside the courtroom before more officers escorted Guygers family out and down a side staircase.The shooting drew widespread attention in the US because of the strange circumstances and as it was one in a string of shootings of unarmed black men by white cops.In emotional testimony last week, Guyger said she blasted the -year-old because she thought he was a burglar and feared for her le.Jurors had to decideGuyger had a valid defence under Texas’ so-called “castle doctrine - which gives people the right to defend their own home.The -year-old had claimed she parked on the wrong floor of the complex by mistake and entered Jean’s flat, thinking it was hers.She was fired from the Dallas police department and indicted on a murder charge shortly after the shooting.The aftermath of the killing was captured on bodycam footage after fellow officers were called.Jurors were shown the disturbing scenes at the ongoing murder trial of the former Dallas cop.Armed officers are seen sprinting up four flights of stairs to the scene of the shooting.When the cops enter the flat, Guyger says: I thought it was my apartment...I thought it was my apartment.The officers then start performing CPR on the shooting victim saying come on Jean, come on Jean.For more than seven minutes they fought to save his le as he lay bleeding on his lounge floor.Jeans mother, sister and other family members left the courtroom just before the video was played.Guyger was tired after working  hours in four days and was on autopilot, her defence attorney Robert Rogers told jurors.The prosecution, however, alleged Guyger, a five-year veteran of the force, missed numerous signs she was on the wrong floor and in the wrong apartment - including a red doormat and clutter in the kitchen.They also claimed she then failed to adequately try to save Jean after shooting him.Despite being in the hallway when officers arrived, Guyger has said she provided first aid to Jean, according to an affidavit.It was also claimed Guyger was more concerned with her own le and career than she was with the dying Jean, reports CNN.When you listen critically to what she is saying, you are going to hear that she is as concerned or more concerned about how this is going to affect her than this poor guy on the floor next to her, prosecutor Jason Hermus told jurors.While she was on the phone with a  operator, she also sent texts to her partner on the force, with whom she was intimate, saying: I need you hurry and I f***ed up, Hermus said.Hermus also sought to show that Guyger violated police protocol by opening fire on her neighbour in the first place.Jean was on his couch in his shorts, watching TV and eating vanilla ice cream when Guyger walked through the front door, Hermus said.Under the circumstances, he said, protocol demanded that she take cover and call for backup instead of opening fire.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, he explains why...TO anyone under the age of around , the lost world of the s probably looks like a very strange place.Indeed, to millennials the Falklands War, Greenham Common women, Les Dawson’s Blankety Blank, Ghostbusters and Michael J Fox on a hoverboard in Back To The Future  — the era must seem like ancient history.But for those of us who are a bit older, these were our formative — and gloriously escapist — years. From the stirring old-fashioned patriotism of Chariots Of Fire to the tear-jerking alien melodrama of ET — though for my six-year-old self, nothing matched the jaw-dropping moment in The Empire Strikes Back when Darth Vader tells Luke Skywalker: “I am your father.”Perhaps only now, as the childhood memories begin to fade, can we see what the s did for us, from the shops on the high street to the contents of the typical family fridge.The first years of the decade, in particular, were a tipping point. The old industrial Britain, where men worked at the local factory, spent their evenings down the pub while women spent their days cooking, cleaning and looking after the kids, collapsed in ruins.Meanwhile a conservative, inward-looking, old-fashioned society was rushing towards a new world of fast food, exotic holidays, outrageous clothes and gleaming new computers.In the public imagination, the woman responsible for all this was Margaret Thatcher. And there’s no doubt that she changed the record after years of stagnation. Instead of flinching from change, as her male predecessors had done in the s and s, she threw open the doors, for both good and ill.But did the Iron Lady really change Britain’ single-handedly  I don’t think so. Look around your home, your workplace or high street, and you realise many of the biggest changes had nothing to do with her at all.Indeed, as Britain’s first female Prime Minister she was simply part of a trend. By the early s, six out of ten British women were going out to work — a higher proportion than in almost every other European country — with businesswomen such as the Body Shop’s Anita Roddick capturing the national imagination.But what would these new working women wear  Some dared to go to work in trousers, though not Mrs Thatcher, who told the papers that her Cabinet colleagues wouldn’t like it.When nine women teachers turned up to their Reading comprehensive in trousers, the headmaster locked them in a classroom so their young pupils’ minds would remain unsullied. And in , a memorial counsellor at Golders Green crematorium in North London was even sacked for wearing a “lady’s business trouser suit”, on the grounds it would offend grieving families.But with so many women working — in trousers or not — who would do the cooking when they got home  The answer, it turned out, was the microwave. By the mid-s there were more microwaves in Britain than in the rest of Europe combined.Thanks partly to TV cooks including Delia Smith and Keith Floyd, the British kitchen was going through a revolution. Out went the steamed puddings and spotted dicks of old. In came pizzas, curries and the ground-breaking Marks  Spencer Chicken Kiev, which cost £. for a pack of two, the equivalent of about £ today.The other big culinary winner of the decade was McDonald’s, which opened hundreds of British outlets during the decade. Like many s kids, I remember my first visit — for my friend Robert Greenwood’s birthday party in about  — as though it was yesterday.We all had cheeseburgers, a grinning Ronald McDonald handed out balloons and afterwards we were given a guided tour of the kitchen. I found the whole thing almost intolerably exciting.McDonald’s isn’t the only s relic still standing on high streets across the country. Next and Waterstones opened in  and Pret a Manger in , all three aimed at young, upwardly mobile professionals, or yuppies.Yet even at this early stage you could see the first shadows of the high street’s decline. In  the most modern shopping centre ever seen in Britain opened in Milton Keynes, Bucks, a vision in steel and glass.And three years later Sainsbury’s opened a pioneering, colossal new supermarket in Nine Elms, South London, with “ ieties of fresh fish”, “ dferent types of bread” and even “fresh orange juice . . . squeezed and bottled under customers’ eyes”.The chain’s plan was to become “the country’s biggest wine merchant, biggest butcher, biggest greengrocer”, all under one roof. Andsmall, family-run shops went to the wall, that was just too bad.What people were buying, too, was changing. Records, for example, gave way to cassettes, then cassettes to CDs.In music, disco and punk were old hat. Thanks partly to the rise of the synthesizer — and also to a new vogue for dressing up and showing off — the baton had passed to the New Romantic generation, spearheaded by groups such as Spandau Ballet, Duran Duran and The Human League.Not since the Sixties had British pop seemed so imaginative, so alive. Indeed, even today the great singles of the era, such as Enola Gay, Don’t You Want Me, Just Can’t Get Enough and Vienna, still have a thrilling sense of technological optimism, captured by their ground-breaking videos.Older music critics hated the New Romantics. But most youngsters loved their new spirit of fun-loving ambition.“I don’t feel guilty because I’ve made enough money to own my own home,” remarked Spandau Ballet’s Gary Kemp. “It’s only the middle classes who feel that kind of guilt.” And Duran Duran’s Simon Le Bon made no secret of his materialistic aspirations. “We want to be substantially wealthy,” he said. “I mean ridiculously wealthy, rolling in it.”There spoke the spirit of the s. But the most dramatic musical innovation, launched in Britain in  , was the Sony Walkman, costing up to £ .Some people were horried by the idea of a personal music player — yet Sony went on to sell millions.  But the innovation that really changed things and for which the s will always be remembered was the computer.At the start of the decade most kids’ idea of fun was completing their Rubik’s Cubes. However, when the Cambridge entrepreneur Clive Sinclair unveiled the ZX in January  — at £. , the world’s first cheap home computer — he unleashed a revolution.By  Mrs Thatcher had committed to putting computers into every school, while the BBC launched its own national computer project, focusing on the new BBC Micro.Britain led the world in computer ownership by the mid-s, and youngsters were mad on games such as Elite, Manic Miner and Jet Set Willy.  At the time, some people recognised that computers would bring a gigantic social and economic transformation.Sinclair predicted the rise of driverless cars and “wireless devices that would allow us to telephone and be telephoned wherever we choose” — then blew his credibility with the C electric car in .Given that the early s saw the worst recession in our post-war history, with unemployment at almost four million, how did people find the money for all this  They borrowed it. Since people felt entitled to the good le, their new microwaves, video recorders and ZX Spectrum computers iniably went on Access or Barclaycard.At the height of the recession in , personal borrowing went up by a fth. Over the decade, it went up seven times. Today, when we’re some of the worst savers and most enthusiastic borrowers in the Western world, I can’t help thinking this is one s habit we really ought to break.The Spectrum may have disappeared into the dustbin of history, but as millions of us know to our cost, those credit card bills never stop coming.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Now its Ukraine.Last night Trump announced he may bring lawsuits against some of the people involved in pushing the controversial Mueller investigation.The White House last week released a transcript of the call between Trump and newly elected Zelensky.It showed Trump asked him to probe Biden and the Democrats are looking into whether Trump used a delayed  million aid package as leverage."},{"url":null,"title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"Soyoure after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further. to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun  - Receive the  biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-le stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TVShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.now! px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" And dont forget to check out the all-new Sun Mobile app - with an amazing facelt, the new app allows you to follow your favourite topics and build your very own homepage.Updated round the clock, its packed full of pictures, videos, and breaking news and showbiz exclusives you really cant find anywhere .  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Five minutes, max, and that was me done.Then the Channel  continuity woman announced: “Richard Madeley’s going in”, and that was effectively me for the next three weeks.Glued to a series called The Circle, which could scarcely be a bigger waste of my own and everyone ’s time.As wastes of time go, though, this one’s pretty much unbeatable.It’s got a good host, for starters, Emma Willis, who has that happy knack of improving every show she guest-presents or, in this case, takes over from Maya Jama and Alice Levine.Emma, of course, hosted another famous Channel  reality show, which, above and beyond the fact the network has sold this format across the world, is the real reason it is so idiotically excited about The Circle.Finally, nine years after junking the show, it has a viable replacement for Big Brother and all that comes with it.A large building, nominations, evictions and a lot of bone-brained contestants who can message each other, inside The Circle, but never meet, meaning they are free to be whoever they want to be.Among those competing to win £,, we’ve got cat-fishing Scouser James, who’s pretending to be a single mum called Sammieand Katie, who’s taken on the identity of her own son, Jay.Hardly ambitious.The sheer effort of the pretence, though, means the most interesting contestants tend to be the ones who are just being themselves and come with a iety of sob stories and boasts, like “Crohn’s survivor” Georgina bisexual dyslexic Woody, who cannot wait to tell everyone he’s Zoe Ball and Norman Cook’s son and Brooke who refers to her breasts as “the goodies”, because they’re the exact same size as Bill Oddie’s head.Smartest and most interesting of the lot, however, is theology professor Tim, who’s keen to foster the idea he looks uncannily like Robin Williams, presumably to distract attention from the fact he looks uncannily like Harold Shipman. Which may also be the reason they didn’t stick Judy Finnigan in that house. Bad visuals.You already know who the real star is, though. It’s Madeley, who entered the show, babbling like a madman, day one, with an acoustic guitar and a keyboard.Deal was, he couldn’t win but had to take on a dferent identity.Richard fancied “an -year-old woman”but the viewers decided he should be a hot -year-old blonde called Judy.The results have been brilliant, not least ’cos Woody has flirted outrageously with “Judy” Richard, who’s had to respond in kind.It’s tinged with regret, though. The show where Richard Madeley really should be uniting a fractured nation in joy and laughter is Strictly.The Circle understands this only too well, so they had him togged up in a motion-capture avatar suit for an unforgettable game of “guess the dance” on Friday, moshing, dabbing and doing a tango that looked like Groucho Marx’s death stagger.“Forty years in journalism and broadcasting,” he sighed sarcastically, “And the pinnacle has arrived.”Yes, yes it finally has, Richard. Now seize the moment and get yourself on Strictly . A nation demands it.David Craig: “Jack Grealish does exactly what he says on the tin.”David Croft: “Vettel punched through a gap that wasn’t there.”And Matt Le Tissier: “I love scoring goals but equally almost liked creating goals as much.”BBC’S latest Far East celebrity travelogue really should’ve been called Sue Perkins Condescends To Meet Some Foreigners.But it wasn’t. They settled instead on Japan With Sue Perkins, who went “in search of the country’s soul” by dressing up as a few cultural stereotypes and probably sending children to bed with nightmares in her geisha girl outfit.If WE did that, of course, “cultural appropriation” would be the least of the accusations made against us. But it seems to be all right here, I think, ’cos Sue’s a middle-class Cambridge graduate who reads the .No matter where she travels, Sue also remains ever-vigilant for the slightest hint of sexism and clearly thought she was guaranteed plenty of that at a government-sponsored speed-dating night, along with lots of other stuff tosspots like to describe as “problematic”.Soyou want to see irony squared, watch the moment towards the end of episode two when Sue grandly tells a whole room of uncomprehending dorks: “Formality permeates every part of Japanese culture. Everything’s driven by boundaries, rules and regulations. They’ve lost the fundamentals.”And then think: “Yeah, what this country really needs is a naked dating show where contestants are judged on the state of their genitals, hosted by Sue Perkins’ missus.”That’ll drag ’em into the st Century.The consistently brilliant Good Morning Britain finding the only Piers Morgan impersonator in Japan who wasn’t wearing a wrestling nappy.Richard Madeley’s cameo in The Circle.Celebrity MasterChef contestant Joey Essex inventing the “stirotto” , which looked about as appetising as a pandopsy .And Strictly’s Mike Bushell attempting the American smooth, with Katya Jones, to that all-time Glen Campbell classic Like A Blind Stoned Cowboy.AMERICAN trailer-trash comedian Vicki Barbolak accidentally locked herself in a pink caravan at the start of her routine on Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions. Then someone from production let her out and the problems really started.Two minutes into her act, Vicki came to a grinding halt and stuttered: “I . . . I . . . I changed everything I was going to do.” And decided to shove any good material down the caravan’s chemical toilet A horribly awkward moment for everyone, though not the first sign the booking process had seriously maled with this episode.That was the previous act – Gennady Tkachenko-Papizh, from Kazakhstan, whose “ceremony of sound” went where your iPhone alarm fears to tread, making the sort of random animal noises usually accompanied by the caption “footage courtesy of PETA”.British politeness rescued him from the silence that should have followed – along with David Walliams, who said: “People are not going to forget the name . . . sorry, I’ve forgotten your name.”What I definitely will remember about Saturday’s episode, though, is the timely question Simon Cowell posed to the act that followed Gennady and Vicki, Twist  Pulse: “The people who didn’t want to compete again.

For the Tories, it is a clear goal of policy.In his ambitious speech to the conference, the Chancellor Sajid Javid – who is the son of a bus driver – declared that the Living Wage would rise over the next five years from the present rate of £.-an-hour to £.-an-hour - and the age limit lowered from  to .Altogether, it is estimated that at least four million people will benefit from these far-reaching changes.The Chancellor’s scheme exposes all the left-wing nonsense about Tory toffs.This is not the action of a Government that is driven by concern only for the wealthy or is indferent to the struggles of those on limited earnings.A modern, thriving economy cannot be built on the back of exploitation and poverty pay.Anyone who goes out to work is entitled to a level of pay that can sustain a reasonable standard of living.Those who object to Sajid Javid’s proposal should be askedthey would be willing to work for less than £.-an-hour.In fact, it is depressing that so many people who do invaluable jobs in the community, like care home workers, hospitality staff and retailers are currently paid less than this.Looking after the elderly or disabled should be well-rewarded positions, not jobs hovering at the level of the minimum wage.Indeed, ever since they came to power in , the Conservatives have prioritised the quest to improve living standards and reward those who hold down jobs.That is why the Government has dramatically cut income tax for the low paid by raising the personal allowance from £,-a-year in  to £, this year.As a result, more than four million people who earn beneath this threshold no longer have to pay income tax at all.Meanwhile, contrary to all the rancid hysteria about alleged Tory bias to the rich, the top one per cent of earners now pay  per cent of all income tax.The Conservatives’ claim to be the party of the workers is further reinforced by their jobs miracle, which far exceeds anything achieved where in Europe.When the Tories took office in , there were widespread predictions that they would preside over soaring dole queues.Just the opposite happened. In the last nine years, no fewer than .million new jobs have been created, most of them full-time.Today, unemployment stands at just . per cent, the lowest level since . Over  per cent of the population is now in work, a historic record, with more women in the workplace than ever before and wages are now growing at their fastest rate in a decade.Inflation is low, while credit and mortgages have never been cheaper, which – along with tax cuts – boosts household budgets.Similarly, a consumer study out this week showed that expenditure on dining out is at its highest level for three years.Tory economic success, in the face of Labour’s hysterical gloom-mongering, points to a fundamental dference between the parties.The Conservatives believe in providing incentives towards diligence and enterprise.In contrast, Labour is ideologically obsessed with levelling down, trying to achieve a dogmatic form of equality through higher taxes, massive redistribution of wealth and lavish social security benefits.As history has continually taught us, it is a disastrous recipe for economic sclerosis and welfare dependency.Raising pay rather than benefits is the best way to bolster living standards.A generous welfare system is a heavy drag on the economy, not only because it imposes a huge burden on the taxpayer but also because it discourages work.On the other hand, a reasonable minimum wage raises productivity in the workplace, puts more money in the pockets of employees and expands the economy.The main objection to a higher minimum comes from employers, who argue that, because of rising costs, staff will be priced out of jobs - but there is little evidence to support such warnings.The same anxieties were voiced when Labour under Tony Blair first campaigned in  for the introduction of a minimum wage.At the time, the Tories said that policy would destroy jobs, particularly among young people. But such dire forecasts never materialised.Thankfully, the Conservatives have learnt that such messages of economic doom are hollow.It will turn our economy into a pioneer, with one of the highest statutory minimums in the world.Inevitably Labour has been carping this week, with the Shadow Chancellor bleating about the Tories’ pathetic attempt at catch-up.But such language just demonstrates Labour’s fear - as their mantle of the party of the workers is steadily pulled from their grasp."},{"url":null,"title":"labour mp rosie duffield reveals","story":"NewsLabour MP Rosie Duffield reveals she was a victim of domestic abuseMs Duffield, the MP for Canterbury, earned a standing ovation after recounting the abuse she was forced to endureShareCommentsByTom DavidsonSenior Reporter:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video mp-shares-commons-personal-experience-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics labour-mp-rosie-duffield-reveals-\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Ms Duffield said: So what is domestic violence or abuse and where do we get our ideas about it from  Often we see the same images and stereotypes on TV - housing estates, working-class families, drunk men coming home from the pub, women surrounded by children, and a sequence of shouting followed by immediate physical violence or assault.    But the soap opera scenes only tend to focus on one or two aspects of a much bigger and more complex picture. Domestic violence has many faces and the faces of those who survive are ied too. Ms Duffield added: Abuse isnapost just about those noticeable physical signs, sometimes there are no bruises. Abuse is very often all about control and power, itaposs about making themselves feel big or biggest, but thataposs not how abusers present themselves. Ms Duffield said that every day is emotionally exhausting for victims of coercive control, who often to have to put on a brave face at work. She added that there comes a point for victims where their abuseraposs mask has slipped for good and questions are starting.    Ms Duffield urged others to come forwardthey are suffering coercive control.

Soanyone is watching and needs a friend, please reach outit is safe to do so and please talk to any of us because we will be there and we will hold your hand. The domestic abuse bill seeks to give better protection to those fleeing violence by placing a new legal duty on councils to provide secure homes for them and their children. It would also introduce the first legal government definition of domestic abuse, which would include economic abuse and controlling and manipulative non-physical behaviour.

The highest earners in prison get more in six months than any prison governor can earn in two years, according to former inmate and restorative justice campaigner Peter Woolf. He said: “People are deliberately going into prison to make money. Contraband is re inside – drugs, mobile phones and tobacco earn the most money, and are constantly smuggled in. “Spice, the synthetic cannabis, is a good earner at the moment. For every £, of spice you can smuggle in, you can make around £,.    “A spice cigarette that costs  pence on the outside, goes for £ to £ on the inside. “It’s a very low-risk business. Let’s face it, the police aren’t going to smash your door down, as you’re already in prison.” An experienced governor will earn a maximum of £, a year, while a prison officer starting out earns £,. An inmate could allegedly earn £, in less than two years. One male prisoner, in HM Prison Bullingdon, in Bicester, Oxfordshire, claims to have made nearly £,. Mark Walker, a prison officer supervisor at the jail, with  years’ experience, confirmed: “He told us, while he’s been in custody, he’s made just over £, selling mobile phones and drugs – and he’s only been in eight months.” A new four-part, ITV series, Inside Prisons: Britain Behind Bars, on tonight, portrays a system that has lost control of contraband. While officers do their best to stop it, prisoners have time to devise more and more elaborate ways to smuggle in banned items.

The historic travel operator owned a worldwide collections of hotels and resorts and left some , Brit tourists stranded around the world when it went into liquidation last week. Incredible pictures show some of the latest hotel brands and re-brandings of existing resorts which the company had only just undertaken - but which came too late to save it. Resorts appeared to be moving away from hedonism and towards a focus on health, with tasteful, peaceful layouts, decor and interiors. Instagram-friendly hotel spaces and a sense of peace, relaxation and luxury became the order of the day as the -year-old firm sensed a change in the appetites of millennial holidaymakers.  Among the resorts and brands owned by Thomas Cook are Sentido, Sunwing, Sunprime and Smartline. The latest hotel brand to open under the same umbrella was Cookaposs Club, a design-led but affordable hotel group aimed at the millennial generation. Recognising a change among young people, Thomas Cook retired its Club - brand late last year and switched the focus. Gone are fishbowl cocktails and all-night parties, replaced with vegetable smoothies and properly crafted drinks. Hotel spaces are designed to be as beautul, and as social media-friendly, as possible, down to the unicorn inflatables scattered across the surface of the swimming pools. It was a huge overhaul and, on the surface of things, seemed to be successful, reports The Manchester Evening News. But all future flights and package holidays with Thomas Cook have been cancelled - and itaposs not looking good for the worldwide collection of hotels or the new brands.  The first to open under the new Cookaposs Club brand was Cook’s Club Hersonissos, on the Greek island of Crete, in June , with seven new hotels opening under the brand in little more than a year. Cookaposs Clubs can be found in Gambia, Turkey, Mallorca, Bulgaria, Greece and Egypt The latest was Cookaposs Club El Gouna, located on the wateraposs edge of a luxurious man-made lagoon just north of Hurghada. This hotel, on Egyptaposs Red Sea coast, only opened its doors in August, and only had its launch party two weeks ago - the Thomas Cook yellow heart above the door got to oversee that, but wonapost see the hotel filled with guests.  The muted grey and brown colours chosen for the hotel contrasted sharply against the piercing blue of the swimming pool, and the murky blue-green of the lagoon beyond. Grey sunbeds around the wateraposs edge were as comfortable as real beds, with matching bean bag chairs scattered beneath the shade of umbrellas. A iety of food stations, from wood-fired pizzas to fresh grilled meats to salads and burgers, were built into the aposCantinaapos to feed guests on either a bed and breakfast or half-board basis. Even the fitness facilities were gorgeous, dumbbells and benches carved from polished wood and presented beneath a bamboo canopy. Itaposs a real looker of a hotel, and as someone sitting nicely within the target demographic of  to  years old, the appeal was obvious. With virtually round-the-clock DJs stationed at the poolside, it was common on my trip to see the young and beautul people of Egyptdraped over fruit-shaped inflatables sipping on Aperol spritzes.  A huge sign at the poolside had light-hearted messages such as: Keep your fluids - in certain circumstances, the exchange of body fluids may be a good idea but... spit, snot and pee do not belong in the pool! El Gouna itself is a network of  twisting and interconnected islands, all made by hand only three decades ago by construction company Orascom. The desert was carved away to entice the ocean in, and now the resort boasts three huge marinas, two golf courses,  spas and around  hotel rooms - all under a blanket of year-round sunshine. Tuk tuks crawl over the resort like colourful bugs, whisking visitors around for a mere  Egyptian poundsper person per trip. Popular restaurants include Morganaposs Beach Restaurant, where all-you-can-eat seafood buffets showcase some of the best seafood in the region, and Captainaposs Inn Steak House, where dishes are presented sizzling.

The dilapidated countryside cottage in Gwynedd, Wales, is in need of a major renovation - but boasts some amazing perks, such as  acres of land. Pictures from inside show a mountain of rubbish and broken furniture in several of the rooms, while the bathroom is covered in mould, reports Wales Online. Paint and wallpaper can also be seen peeling off the walls.  In the listing, the estate agent advises potential buyers to aposmake sure they wear suitable footwear and clothing as the grounds are wet and there is some overgrowth accessing the propertyapos. The agents add that all viewers should, apostake extra care when visiting the siteapos. They have not ulged the circumstances behind how the property fell into such disrepair.  Andyou want to take a quick look at the bedrooms upstairs, youaposre out of luck as the staircase is considered too dangerous to use. A new staircase and floors upstairs are needed, plus electrics, plumbing, and damp work among other things. However, a viewing is recommended to get the atmosphere of the building and its gorgeous location.  It has the potential to be turned into a three or four bedroom family home. There are two adjoining single-storey barns, either of which could make a kitchen diner opening out onto the land, or these buildings could become an annexe or holiday let.  The main house has a number of period features to restore, including ceiling beams and an impressive inglenook fireplace with huge wooden beam mantle. The solid stone walls are currently predominantly white-washed and could look incredible once the paint has been removed, allowing the original stone to sing about its beauty again.

The owners of the house in Neath have applied a unique personal style inside. Now, Wales Online reports , normal walls and doors have been replaced by entrances framed with glass bricks. And throughout itaposs rooms there are several interesting visual touches that demand instant attention. This is probably most evident in the huge kitchen-diner at the rear of the property.  Instead of the expected small kitchen and rear dining room of a terraced house, there is a large extension that provides a very sociable and light space. In this room the art deco basics are pretty much covered. There are colour LEDs hidden away that provide accent colours typical of the s think Miami sea-front home or cool American diner.  The sunken ceiling provides the classic art deco lozenge shape as well as the space to hide the mint green accent lighting. There are subtle curves included in the interior design, mainly provided by the unusual semi-circular kitchen island which also has hidden pink LEDs for the continuation of the Miami feel.  There is symmetry provided by the black splash-back tiles, the triple set of French doors to the garden plus the inventive use of glass bricks again. Both ends of the room have a symmetrical set of glass blocks that not only provide extra light, they continue the art deco theme initially set in the hallway. The fireplace at one end of the kitchen is an amazing chrome log burner, reminiscent of the vintage, cigar-shaped art decor chrome caravans in shape and texture. The house has benefited from not only from losing some walls and widening some doorways, but also from a two-storey rear extension. The ground floor accommodation is vast compared to what any visitor might expect from the outside.  There is a separate sitting room and dining room that could both become bedrooms, turning the home from a surprising five bed into an incredible seven bed property. This would still leave the house with a separate lounge and the large kitchen-diner. The versatility of this unusual home continues upstairs, in fact up two flights of stairs as, although not obvious from the outside, this house also has a loft conversion which has a surprise. Instead of a standard dormer, there is a window that continues down the roof to the floor to provide easy access onto a terrace that is the roof of the extension. Genius. Of course the view from the roof terrace is unusual, this house is brilliant at being unique, and looks out onto Neath RFCaposs rugby pitch - so no need to buy a season ticket, although some scrums might be missed due to annoying hedges in the way.  Back to the first floor and the whole width of the rear of the property has been converted into a huge master suite. The master bedroom is so large it can easily accommodation a three-piece suite and has a walk-in wardrobe and dressing room bigger than most terrace homeaposs third bedroom. In fact, it probably used to be this terraceaposs aposbox roomapos. Again the homeaposs versatility is evident, as the master bedroom could be ided into two bedrooms to increase the sleeping accommodation,changing theof any of the living space downstairs is not appealing to a new owner. The main bathroom on the first floor does not disappoint on the aposwow factorapos either.

The latest victims are a woman from New Jersey and a person from Virginia. No other details - including the gender of the second person - have been given to protect the privacy of their families. State Health Commissioner M. Norman Oliver said: I am deeply saddened to announce the first death of a Virginia resident related to this outbreak. Our thoughts are with the family during this dficult time. The Virginia victim died on September . As of September , there were  lung injury cases, including the death, in Virginia.    Nationally, the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionreports  cases from  states and one U.S. territory. Last week,  other deaths had been confirmed in  states. Since then, three deaths have also been reported by state departments in Nebraska, North Carolina and Oregon.  The cause of the outbreak is unknown but has been described as an epidemic. Walmart has also said it will stop selling e-cigarettes at its stores. Health officials recommend that people who are concerned about lung injuries associated with e-cigarette use or vaping refrain from using e-cigarette products.  A spokesman added: Regardless of the ongoing investigation, people who use e-cigarette products should not buy these products off the street and should not mody e-cigarette products or add any substances that are not intended by the manufacturer. E-cigarette products should never be used by youth, young adults, pregnant women, or adults who do not currently use tobacco products. People who do use e-cigarette products should monitor themselves for symptomsand promptly seek medical attention or call a poison control center. As we previously reported, two people from Kansas also died recently from a vaping-related illness.In the UK, Public Health Englandstands by its claim that vaping is % less harmful than smoking. It has come under fire from some academics who say the organisation is wilfully ignoring mounting evidence that vaping is harmful. Martin Dockrell, tobacco control lead at PHE, said: A full investigation is not yet available but indications are that the US cases have been linked to people using illicit vaping fluid bought on the streets or home-made, some containing cannabis products like THC oil or synthetic cannabinoids like spice, and others Vitamin E acetate oil.

The alleged victims include an eight-year-old girl who reportedly annoyed the grandmother suspect by playing too noisily. The youngster was killed after she cheekily threw ice cream at the pensioner after being told to be quiet, it is claimed. Sofya Mikhailovna was arrested after janitor Vasily Shlyakhtich, , who had agreed to rent a room in her apartment in the village of Berezovka, located in Russiaaposs Khabarovsk Territory, vanished in January this year.    Police intensied the search operation when body parts found in bins around the city were suspected of belonging to the missing man, and they decided to issue a search warrant for her apartment. A spokesman at the Russian Investigative Directorate in the Khabarovsk Territory said: Criminologists discovered knives and saws on which they discovered traces of the blood of the victim. She was arrested for murder, and put in pre-trial detention as the investigation continued. Locals said the alleged cannibal killer was Sonya Sipataya because she had a deep masculine voice and cut her hair like a man, walking around the area in camouflage gear and often carrying an axe, and that she would regularly kill the cats in the neighbourhood, even though they bothered nobody . One local identied only by her first name Tatyana said: We always found it strange that despite being surly and unfriendly, she would often find the time to cook things for the local children. They were always meat dishes. Sometimes she gave them to the adults, she bought me and my husband plates with jellied meat . She added: I remember it well because my husband said letaposs not eat it, you never know what it was made from, and now it looks like he was right. Tatyana said police had confirmed that she used meat from the people she killed.    However, police declined to comment when contacted by Central European Newsbecause the investigation is still ongoing. Under interrogation, she reportedly admitted to killing her lodger, and as the police probed deeper, they were shocked when she then allegedly also admitted to killing an eight-year-old girl who disappeared on th December . She reportedly said the girl was a nuisance and had annoyed her by running around making noise, and that the final straw was when the child had thrown a piece of ice cream at her. After that her fate was sealed. Police still have the case open because a few fragments of human remains were found at the time that they identied as belonging to the child. But the mother, identied as Natalya Alekseenko, whose age was not given, insisted that the body could not have been her daughter, and still had hopes that she was alive and had been taken by somebody. According to local media, human entrails were found in the suspectaposs fridge. When she heard that the girl had been killed by the pensioner - dubbed a cannibal in Russian media. although it is unclearshe actually ate anyone herself - she broke down. She said: I believed against everything that she was still alive, I waited and I believe. People would tell me Natasha, this is your daughter, but I didnapost listen to anyone. After apparently confessing to the child murder, she then reportedly admitted to a third killing, this time in April  when she allegedly murdered a female friend, Nina Babenko, aged , after she moved in as a lodger.

Anybody looking at the league will say ‘those two should coast it’ but it’s never as simple as that.“I knew it wouldn’t be.“It’s a tough league – that’s why United have been in it so long, why Hibs took a while to get out – Hearts were the exception.“They had the chance to build for this league beforehand, though.“It is a tough job but I’ve said that from day one – I’m not just saying that because we have had an average start to the season.“I make no excuses for that and I know it will get tougher as the season goes on but I know we will get better.“The longer my team is together, we will start to see a real fluency very soon.”With almost an entire new squad brought in over the summer, James accepts Dundee are behind others in the ision when it comes to building a successful squad for the Championship.However, he says there are signs that is coming at Dens Park as they bid to overhaul the three teams above them – Dundee United, Ayr and Inverness Caley Thistle.“Ayr are a good side,” James added.“I saw a fair bit of them last year and it’s no surprise they are up at the top. They were really good when they came to Dens and they have a real consistency.“It’s been a very similar squad they’ve had for a few seasons now, a successful one that came up and Ian McCall added quality to them.“Inverness are the same and that shows the need for consistency in your approach in this league.“The teams that do well have that.“We had a big sht in terms of players and staff – it’s been a huge turnaround.“Everybody wants it to happen at the click of a button, everybody hits the ground running and you get off to a flyer but it’s not easy.“I think anybody you speak to will say it’s dficult to firstly get people in the door and then get everybody playing together.“We are getting there. It is tough but nothing we didn’t expect.“It’s up to me and my staff to find the right way of getting an effective team on the pitch to start turning the good play, which there has been a lot of, into goals.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"sports direct stay silent questions remain over the fate of overgate superstore","story":"The future of one of the Overgate’s most prominent stores is still unclear weeks after Sports Direct announced it was to open a new shop in Dundee.Last month the sports retailer revealed plans to create a store with a USC concession on the site of Tescoin the Murraygate.Sports Direct bought the site in November  and claims talks to renew Tesco’s lease broke down.But the firm has remained silent over the future of its Sports Direct and USC shops in the Overgate. vw, px\"  Malcolm Angus, boss at the shopping centre, said discussions about the shop’s future within the centre were ongoing.He said: “We are aware of Sports Direct’s Murraygate site plans and have been in discussions with them about their intentions.”Documents obtained by the Tele show the Murraygate unit – once a Woolworths and a John Menzies – was purchased by SDILtd for £. million – a subsidiary of Sports Direct’s property arm.The seven-figure investment is good news, according to Alison Henderson, chief executive of Dundee and Angus Chamber of Commerce.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

The main cause is the revised tarfs for out of area patients.#In addition, we have had a mental health long stay patient from out of our area which accounts for £, of the in-month movement which is unusual.#On the forecast year overspend, Ms Orr added: #The biggest single area of social work overspend is on learning disability, where there has been a failure to deliver anticipated savings so far, along with higher than budgeted demand.#This links closely with the year to date position. Again both are affected by the same factors. The next two largest areas of forecast overspend are physical disability and older people.#The biggest threat to the financial position of the IJB remains an ongoing dispute over service level agreement charges with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, with the overspend liable to rise should no deal be reached.Ms Orr added: #The IJB made a decision to reject the increase [in service level agreement charges] and the forecast outturn reflects this position. If this position is not accepted by Greater Glasgow and Clyde then there is a risk that the outturn overspend could increase by £m to £m.#"},{"url":null,"title":"salmon firm funds inveraray shinty equipment","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Shinty Club has been boosted by a donation from the Scottish Salmon Company#s community fund.The money will allow the club’s junior team to invest in new training kit and goal posts, enhancing their ability to compete in games and tournaments.

Police Scotland does not make any financial contribution to the town centre schemes.ldquoThe councilrsquos current position with regard to CCTV provision is not to install new CCTV equipment or replace le-expired systems but to continue to maintain the current asset within the existing revenue budget until they are beyond economic repair.ldquoFor information, previous work undertaken by officers in  indicated that the likely total capital cost of replacement, on a like for like basis, while utilising more modern digital technologies, could be in the region of circa pound,.ldquoThere would be potentially additional costs associated with related civils works and infrastructure in the region of pound,.ldquoA follow up report could update and validate this figure to present-day costs, however given the anticipated capital expenditure of circa poundm, plus a requirement for future on-going enhanced revenue expenditure, officers do not believe that this will provide value for money.ldquoIn addition, there is currently no identied budget, either capital or revenue.However, at a full council meeting in May, Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell put forward a motion calling on officers to explore options for keeping the CCTV network, and officers have suggested a public consultation be held.The motion was agreed, and so the council will consult with ious stakeholders in the CCTV network, including Police Scotland, community councils and area partnerships, as well as providers of CCTV network systems and infrastructure to determine potential costs.The consultation will then form the basis of a series of options for CCTV in the Borders which councillors will be asked to approve, most likely in December.The councilrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, councillor Gordon Edgar, said: ldquoWe know that CCTV can be a useful tool for the police and communities in terms of public safety.ldquoHowever, we also know that in order for the cameras to contribute to creating safe environments in our towns, the technology needs to be kept up-to-date.ldquoWith a growing demand for our services, and budget constraints, the Council must consider whether replacing the current system is value for money, and what other options are available.ldquoIn order for the council to make a fully informed decision, we need the views of the public and would encourage residents, businesses and community groups to take part in our consultation before the October  deadline.The survey is available at scotborders.citizenspace"},{"url":null,"title":"dream-wedding-dashed-thomas-cook-goes-bust","story":"A PEEBLES couple have had their dream wedding in Turkey shattered by the collapse of Thomas Cook.Groom Kevin Weir and his bride Kirsteen Barrett forked out pound, to fly their  guests to celebrate their wedding in the sun.But with only two weeks to go until they jetted off to say their vows, news that the travel firm had gone bust wrecked their plans.The distraught couplersquos wedding is now in ruins and they fear it could take months before they see a penny of their money refunded.Bride-to-be Kirsteen told us she broke down after hearing news that the travel operator had gone into liquidation this week.ldquoI just couldnrsquot believe it.

At .pm on Saturday night a flock of Pink-footed Geese passed over my house from north to south, probably heading for the Solway or Lancashire.On the same day, a trip was made to the middle Teviot to look for Whooper Swans as two were reported earlier in the week and six noted at Dowlaw Dam near Cockburnspath.However, the trip produced nothing, so they may have moved on.On September  the local branch of the Scottish Ornithologistrsquos Club organised a field trip to St Abbrsquos Head. Several members met up at the main car park at the visitor centre and shared transport to the car park just near the lighthouse.The sun was out but a strong wind was encountered. The group set off to explore the west side of Mire Loch but found the wind too strong to make the birds show.Birds were present but keeping a low profile and the noise of the wind rustling the leaves did not help to locate birds by their calls. A Blue Tit appeared along with Wren and Dunnock. Several Chfchaff uttered their contact calls and a Goldcrest was seen briefly.On the Mire Loch a pair of Mute Swans protected three well-grown cygnets. Tucked into the reeds was a Little Grebe and as we walked down to the dam end several Moorhen called.Mallard, Tufted Duck and Coot were added to the site list.As the group moved slowly along the track several Speckled Wood butterflies sunned themselves. At the dam end at the edge of the willows there were about  Red Admirals. But no unusual migrant birds.The group headed up the path back towards the carpark, but again few birds. In the bay and on the clfs near the car park were a few Fulmars and a steady passage of Gannets. The odd Guillemot passed but no signicant movement on the sea. At the lighthouse a pair of House Martins were still catching insects for a late brood. The lighthouse walled garden had been receiving migrants but on the visit only two Robin made an appearance. Interesting, however, was the discovery of male and female Small Copper butterflies and seven Pinkfeet coming in off the sea.After lunch at the lighthouse garden, the party headed down to Burnmouth to examine the shore for waders. After scanning the foreshore Curlew, Redshank, Oystercatcher and Turnstone were found. Around the harbour were several Great Blacked Gulls, one of which carried a yellow colour ring, the details of which have been registered on the British Trust for Ornithologist online form for reporting ringed birds.At the moment the result has still to be received as regards where it was ringed. A Mute Swan was feeding in one of the rock pools and a Goosander was asleep at the edge of a pool. The only other birds of interest were a Rock Pipit and Peregrine.From Burnmouth some of the party headed inland to Foulden to view a small pond for wildfowl and waders. On the way down to the site from the village two Tree Sparrows and some Collared Dove were noted. On the pond we found a couple of Greylag but a few days previously there had been several hundred. Some  Pink-feet were present but before we left another  arrived. The pond was scanned thoroughly but no waders present, only four Pied Wagtails. A few Wigeon and Teal were added bringing the total for the three sites to .After the members had finished up for the day, the warden at St Abbrsquos reported on a short sea watch which he had undertaken later in the day. During our visit there was nothing unusual moving over the sea but the warden accounted for an adult Pomarine Skua, a Manx Shearwater and four Red-breasted Merganser. Then at .am the next day another birder had a Sabinersquos Gull with Kittiwakes and an Artic Skua. Then on September  a Mediterranean Gull appeared over the wardenrsquos cottage and there was a fly-past by a Grey Plover.These sightings had obviously aroused interest and a two-hour sea watch first thing on September  saw three Arctic Skua flying north,  Red-throated Divers, nine north, five south and  Common Scoter flying north.Less common migrants began to appear towards the end of the week with Lesser White Throat, Yellow-browed Warbler, Wood Warbler, Pied Flycatcher, Barred Warbler, Yellow Wagtail, Redstart and Black Redstart.In the following week Barnacle Geese passed over. This illustrates that birdwatching at this time of year can be exciting.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

Sheep can be used in so many ways to benefit the environment and naivety from mainstream media risks increasing our environmental footprint.’Livestock is also widely criticised for its methane emissions which NSA say is, again, misleading.Mr Stocker added: ‘Methane shouldn’t be ignored it is an emitted gas that has an impact on global warming.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule. There is too much at stake, not just for me but for my children and this dear planet which is home for us all, but dying in our care."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-parking-plans-discussion-held-private","story":"East Lothian Council is working on designs that would see the parking provision changed in the town, including the possibility of a -plus-space long-stay car park on the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.However, town centre traders are concerned about the possibility of spaces being lost on High Street and Market Street, with it also being mooted that the long-stay car park at Tesco, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could become short-stay only.The issue was briefly mentioned at the townrsquos community council meeting last Tuesday evening.Usually, these meetings are open to the public and the press however, it was agreed to cut short next monthrsquos meeting to allow community councillors to discuss the controversial plans in private.Jan Wilson, the grouprsquos long-standing chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom not sure how much can be made public at the moment.ldquoI know community council meetings should be public but there are times when I have to say no because the proposals are not set in stone yet.

called lsquoCommunity Links Projectsrsquo but the team in North Berwick wanted to do something on a dferent model.Community Connections uses members of the community to introduce others to groups and

ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

We are told there is a two week wait when all the anecdotal evidence is that it is at least threenot four weeks.A spokesperson from Riverside said: ldquoIn East Lothian, as in many parts of Scotland, people are living longer with increasingly complex health and care needs.ldquoIn response to this growing challenge, Riverside Medical Practice has been working hard over the last few years to transform the way our patients are being cared for, working closely with a wider range of healthcare professionals to ensure the right care is provided by the right person at the time help is needed.ldquoThrough this, the practice has made signicant improvements in providing lsquosame dayrsquo appointments for those whose health concern may be urgent. In addition, through making these positive changes, Riverside has been able to provide more and longer advance bookable GP appointments.ldquoRiverside is growing our team of GPs and has successfully recruited seven new GPs over the last two years.ldquoThe practice is currently going through a period of signicant telephone and clinical systems upgrades that will not only address the limitations patients at the Riverside practice have experienced but will introduce a new low-charge  number.ldquoOnce complete, the upgrades, in line with the new way of working, will provide long-term benefits for all patients in the area.

For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Tories minimum wage shift shows politics is moving left","story":"And what better politician to apply the phrase to than Boris Johnson, accused of what has become known as ldquothigh-gate ndash that he placed his hand on a woman journalists leg  years ago. He denies it, of course. But for advocates of the personal is political, his casual conduct is of immense signicance.Similarly, language and the PMs use of military metaphors betray personal traits that are politically signicant. His resort to words like ldquohumbug and ldquoSurrender Act are supposedly windows into the corrupt soul of a misogynistic micro-fascist. I hereby claim , by the way, on the term ldquomicro-fascist, which is an extension of the idea of ldquomicro-aggressions, so popular on university campuses among people who believe tiny things matter a lot.But do they  The media is obsessed with language right now, and personal conduct, possibly because many of its practitioners grew up with the personal is political phrase ringing in their ears. Twitter cant get enough of this stuff, though its no slouch itself when it comes to aggressive language. ldquoRacist, Liar. Misogynist. Mendacious, philandering scumbag! were some of the more temperate reactions on social media to Boris Johnsons recent round of BBC interviews.But judging from the PMs relaxed and unruffled demeanour on Marr and the Today programme, hes not that bothered. His political advisers believe that most people are, rightly or wrongly, supremely indferent to the question of where the PMs hand strayed  years ago. And the preoccupation with language they find almost comical. People use military metaphors all the time, like ldquostick to your guns. Doesnt mean they want to kill you with cannons.Indeed,military metaphors are to be regarded as incitements to violence, then Sir John Curtice had better watch out when he next talks of the general election ldquocampaign being a ldquobattleground with ldquotarget seats, an ldquoair war and a ldquodecapitation strategy. Boris Johnson just makes jokes about all this synthetic outrage. Why  Because the politics of the PMs personal le and language plays well in the echo-chambers of Twitter, but not in focus groups, where people are bothered about pay, jobs, the NHS and Brexit, Brexit, Brexit.Im not so sure. Torsten Bell, of the low pay think tank the Resolution Foundation, takes it seriously and hailed it as ldquohugely ambitious. Sajid Javid says he is adopting their policy of a living wage set at % median earnings, to eliminate poverty pay in a decade.Now, they may not mean it. But it seems to me something pretty fundamental is going on undergrowth of British politicsthe Conservatives are even talking this way. The centre-ground has moved dramatically and suddenly to the left.Im not saying the PM has become a Marxist, but its striking that he has started to use the language of Keynesian economics. It is rare enough to hear a Tory advocate higher public spending. But Johnson is now echoing Labours argument that low interest rates are a unique opportunity for governments to make massive investments in infrastructure, new hospitals, gigabit broad-band etc.When did you last hear a Tory PM make the case for what is sometimes called ldquoPeoples Quantitative Easing  Margaret Thatcher would be appalled at this abandonment of fiscal prudence and Javids talk of the Tories being a ldquoworkers party. Even Tony Blair regarded redistribution and deficit financing as ldquoold Labour.Of course, a lot of what the PM says is probably electioneering: offering jam tomorrow and bagels after Brexit. But it also marks a big sht in the electoral ldquobattlegroundIm still allowed to use that term. Its a tribute to the work of parties like Labour and the SNP who have rehabilitated social democratic policies after three decades in the wilderness.Indeed, the Scottish National Partys policies, on the ldquosocial wage, borrowing and taxation, are beginning to look distinctly conservative, with a small ldquoc. Jeremy Corbyns policies on nationalisation, public spending, Universal Basic Services etc. no longer seem so extreme.The great moving left show is taking us into very interesting political territory, where many of the dogmas of the neoliberal era, which began with Margaret Thatchers monetarist experiments, are falling way. Im not sure where Brexit fits into all this, but it has clearly been a catalyst. Pressure from the ldquoleft behinds in provincial England has provoked a fracturing in the ideology of the right.People are fed up with austerity, low wages, crumbing infrastructure. They want big changes, not just in the way politicians talk, but what they actually do. I cant remember a time quite like this. Andthe Tories are actually talking left, I want to hear more of it. I want interviewers to interrogate the PM about these policies, and not just thigh-gate because we need to know just how seriously to take this new language.The personal may of of huge signicance to some people, but we should never forget that the political is political too, and thats important for all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"headline","story":"The charity Alzheimer Scotland says dementia is not treated as an illness with progressive and complex physical and cognitive symptoms and needs are assessed as social care rather than healthcare, which leaves iniduals and their families facing ldquodisproportionate charges.A campaign launched today by The Herald and our sister title the Evening Times backs the charityrsquos call to the Government to ensure all patients with advanced dementia can access specialist nurses, palliative care and consultant geriatricians at no cost in the final months or years of their lives.Carers groups say being asked to pay for nursing costs comes as a ldquoshock to many families ndash weekly care home costs with -hour specialist nursing can reach pound,.Alzheimer Scotland will launch a new documentary today in Glasgow, as part of its campaign push, which aims to highlight the ldquounfair disparity of dementia care costs, featuring former STV anchor Mike Edwards whose mother was diagnosed with vascular dementia in .Estimates suggest around , Scots are living with advanced dementia.ldquoThe Governmentrsquos callous dismissal of the plight of these sick and dying people makes me feel angry and sad that my country has abandoned them, my husband and me, for the sake of money.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Fair Care dementia film\",\"description\": \"Fair Care dementia film\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media ihGQsNb poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests ihGQsNb.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Henry Simmons, chief executive of Alzheimer Scotland, said: ldquoThe nature of dementia is that you could be living well for many years and enjoying a good quality of le but your needs will start to change and you will require more support.ldquoPatients are in a social care assessment situation and have to pay for elements of their care as a result of that, but the problem is there is not a reassessment from when their needs change from social care to almost entirely healthcare.ldquoIf they go into a residential care setting, someone with advanced dementia requires -hour nursing care, help to eat, to toilet, to bathe. All of which would be described as NHS healthcare needs.ldquoHowever, there is no definition within our current policy for advanced dementia. This person has now progressed and at that point they need healthcare and it should be free.ldquoThe model would be that an advanced specialist team will come in to allow that person to remain where they want to remain be that at home or in a care home which could be specialist geriatricians, palliative care, nursing care.ldquoThis is all readily available but you donrsquot see that being brought to the person where they are. The cancer specialists we see are clear that the level of support is far better than what they experience in their own personal lives with regard to dementia.ldquoWith dementia there is also loss of capacity, soyou think about it we are still taking thousands of pounds out of their bank account for care which we would argue is healthcare. Thatrsquos where the injustice lies. Itrsquos a huge amount of money for some people. These are people who have paid into our system their whole lives, who have built our societies. For us to say, we canrsquot afford that, itrsquos unjustiable.Alzheimer Scotland is also campaigning for improvements in the support offered to people with dementia and their families.The Scottish Government says every person diagnosed with dementia is entitled to a year of post-diagnostic support.However, according to the charity less than half of those diagnosed are referred because of a shortage of dedicated link workers, who may be mental health nurses, occupational therapists or social workers.Mr Simmons said: ldquoA link worker costs around pound, per year per person. The evidence is that it can delay admission to a care home for two to three years.The Scottish Government has said it is considering the findings of a report by the charity, Delivering Fair Dementia Care for People with Advanced Dementia.The report says residential care-charging policies are confusing and can result in signicant costs, particularly for those classed as self-funding.The charity estimates that  per cent of funds are going towards care.Mr Simmonds said: ldquoThe question is not so much how do we pay for this, itrsquos do we want to pay for it  My problem isnrsquot to raise taxes and decide how we spend it, my problem is to represent those iniduals who donrsquot have a voice.ldquoWe have a duty to inform the policy makers and the public that this is an injustice and an inequality.ldquoThe response we have had from political parties, there are very few people who have said this is wrong. Irsquom not saying it can be fixed overnight.ldquoIn the society we want to live in which is a fair and inclusive one, we have a section of our population who will develop advanced dementia and require round-the-clock nursing care and itrsquos not right that we charge them for the privilege of that when no other condition is treated in that way.ldquoWersquove seeing some good progress, wersquove got all the models, all the research and itrsquos not all about massive amounts of money. We are inundated from people from America and Japan all wanting to use our models. Our models are about transforming the system without too much cost.

What we are saying is that when people reach that point, they should no longer be subject to care charges.ldquoYou might be in a residential care home.

People were particularly fascinated, it seemed, in her arresting collection of jewelled insect brooches. Yet what has struck me is her advice on how a woman can reach the top of her profession.Lady Hale offered her hard-won guidance at the launch of a group called Cambridge Women in Law. A graduate of Girton College, she told those following in her footsteps that few females can reach the upper echelons of the male-dominated legal world entirely by their own efforts. For starters, they will be battling against an engrained masculine sense of entitlement that puts them at an immediate disadvantage. Even more signicant, however, is their domestic situation. ldquoProbably the most important thing when you are making your way as a woman in the law is to choose the right partner, she said, doubtless making some of her listeners delete their last text message demanding to know what time theyrsquod be home to make dinner.:Boris Johnson cant remember grope allegation eventTwice married, Hale was quick to note that her first husband as well as her second had been completely supportive. Despite all her intellectual and emotional capabilities, which in a perfect universe would catapult her and those like her to stardom whatever their personal circumstances, she was unequivocal. The choice of whether to have a le partner, and who that partner is, will prove vital to a womanrsquos advancement. Clearly, what holds for the law is equally true for other walks of le. Facebookrsquos chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote, ldquoI donrsquot know of one woman in a leadership position whose le partner is not fully ndash and I mean fully ndash supportive of her career.You need only think of Philip May, acting discreetly behind the arras as Theresa Mayrsquos unofficial consigliere to see this principle borne out. While the PM negotiated the most dficult job in Europe, grafting into the small hours, and on call night and day, he provided the psychological underpinning, or scaffolding, on which she stood. That ultimately her plans imploded does not diminish the fact that without his bolstering presence, his enabling faith in her ability to carry on, she would not have had the mental strength to persevere to the bitter end.Finding a partner who will be wholly encouraging isnrsquot easy. Too often the romantic knot has been tied long before the pressures of a womanrsquos career begin to escalate. If by then a couple have children, it takes deep pockets to pay for household help and childcare while two demanding vocations are conducted at full throttle, or an unusually far-sighted and self-abnegating companion prepared to put their own job, and ego, into cold storage for a few years.Such iniduals do exist, but finding him or her, while in the first flush of youth, takes greater maturity than most possess. Conversely, by the time a woman is older, wiser, and more established in her role, the biological clock can be ticking so loudly it drowns out common sense when getting hitched. Add to this the fact that women in all-consuming careers, such as medicine, law or the media, tend to get involved with those in equally full-on occupations, with similarly vaulting ambitions.:Boris Johnson to make final offer to EU on BrexitLady Halersquos comments will have struck a nerve with many working women. You can picture them, conducting a silent audit on their partners over the toast and marmalade, wonderingthey fall into the category of clinging ivy or storm-proof trellis. Yet the evidence of those who reach the top has been there all along, and what this high-flying judge says should come as no surprise.As far back as the s the brilliant mathematician Mary Somerville flourished because her second husband recognised her talent and gave her space to pursue her ideas. She still had to make sure the children were cared for, and was obliged to drop everything when guests unexpectedly called, but by the standards of the day her spousersquos attitudes were truly enlightened. Pierre Curie was another such enabler, while closer to our own times there has been no more devoted partner than Denis Thatcher or George Clooney, each treating his other halfrsquos ambitions with absolute seriousness.Weary of being an invisible launch-pad, some women like to quip: ldquoBehind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes. Yet one of the questions Halersquos speech raises is whether or not men who aspire to be top dog are equally reliant on a partnerrsquos support. Could it be that, even in these more egalitarian times, women are more in need of a human coat of armour than men Like it or not, a high-powered position is not easy to sustain, whether yoursquore male or female. The toll on those at home is heavy. For true harmony, a household has room for only one stratospheric performer. Yet the back-up and moral support essential to someonersquos professional success is not the mundane business of stocking the fridge or doing the laundry, necessary though these are. Five-star house-keeping alone is not enough.If a partnership s like a Swiss watch, each cog performing its assigned role and never missing a beat, itrsquoll soon run into troublethere isnrsquot something more nourishing keeping it ticking. Surely itrsquos the deep emotional connection with a loved one, and the intellectual stimulation essential to a good relationship, that help a person achieve their best I will concede that most women probably need more overt confidence-boosting. Yet given the dearth of us at the pinnacle of whatever profession you care to name, itrsquos far too soon to know whether those who reach the uppermost rungs need more unconditional back-up from their partners than men. Personally, I canrsquot see why there would be much dference. For the moment, though, you could say that on this subject the jury is still out."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10491717.jpg?type=article-full","title":"alister-jack-suggests-creation-union-day-bank-holiday","story":"In a  at the Conservative Party Conference, he quipped that a new holiday could be created to celebrate the union.Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns, Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith and Secretary of State for Scotland Alister Jack, on stage during the Conservative Party Conference at the Manchester Convention Centre.

If so, then Britain is the most boring, greedy, complacent, repetitive, mimsy little gingham and pinstripe corner of the world imaginable. You learn zilch about le and the people living ityou watch these shows.But this isnrsquot a diatribe against reality TV. I have come to praise the genre, not bury it. Irsquove long championed reality TV. I just donrsquot rate The Apprentice or Bake-Off as great representatives of the genre. The best reality TV gives viewers a glimpse of whatrsquos shting about in the tectonic plates of our world, how humans feel right here and right now, how society is changing, how peoplersquos lives and attitudes are being shaped.Reality TV is the very heart of popular, mainstream entertainment. I donrsquot think you can fully get to grips with the world unless you embrace reality TV and use it to navigate not just pop culture, but wider culture. If you think Irsquom mad, let me call TS Eliot in defence. Eliot, probably the th centuryrsquos greatest poet, was a huge admirer of the Music Hall ndash which was seen, a century ago, as the home of trash entertainment. Culturally, Music Hall was the Edwardian equivalent of reality TV. Eliot, though, believed Music Hall ndash with its iety acts, smut and sentimentality ndash was the truest representation of the society within which he lived. He felt that the Music Hall singer and comedian Marie Lloyd ldquorepresented and expressed something signicant about the spirit of the nation. Roll forward  years and Eliot could have been speaking about Big Brotherrsquos Jade Goody.George Orwell was also a fan of Music Hall. Many like him saw it as having a ldquoredeeming socialas it held a mirror directly up to ordinary le.Big Brother had more social signicance in a single episode than every series of The Apprentice and the Bake-Off put together. From the get-go it showed society changing when it came to sexuality and gender. It revealed chasms of racism in Britain, which were not being discussed. It showed up our culturersquos cruelty, pettiness, narcissism, stupidity and greed. Yes, of course, it was manipulative, gaudy, and loud ndash but so was the Music Hall. You have to accept the bits you donrsquot like to get to the juice within.I find it an endless source of irony that the people who binge-eat The Apprentice and the Bake-Off sneer like Jacob Rees-Mogg confronted with a Greggs sausage roll when mention is made of shows like Big Brother.For the best of Reality TV, donrsquot bother watching The Apprentice tonight. Watch The Circle on Channel . Itrsquos as noisy and day-glo as Big Brother, but itrsquos also the most compelling dissection of the effects of social media on human beings that Irsquove ever seen.The show sees a group of strangers placed in isolation and only able to communicate via social media. On social media, they can be whoever they want to be. The last series was won by a man pretending to be a woman. Contestants are allowed to post fake pictures of themselves, or lie and manipulate. This series sees one man pretending to be a single mother, and a middle aged woman posing as a laddish bricklayer.As in the online world, people immediately place all emphasis on appearance ndash the selfie rules ndash but no-one knows whatrsquos fake, whatrsquos true. Contestants are addicted to clicks and likes. They lose touch with the real world and real human beings. They become needy, nervous, depressed, obsessed. They fall foul of group-think. They fear rejection ndash they crave the love of the online world they inhabit.On The Circle the mere act of posting a good or bad picture can change how everyone thinks of you. Itrsquos about curating your le so others see only your best side, not the real you. People share personal information in a way theyrsquod never do in real le. Acts of kindness are phoney and virtue-signalled. Everything comes with a hashtag and an emoji. Everything is manipulated. And when reality finally breaks in and the contestants meet each other in real le theyrsquore nothing like their digital selves. We see the real them ndash honest, shy, decent hellip normal.This is reality TV which explores the new reality in which we live: a phoney, empty, dumbed-down world thatrsquos a bit like an episode of The Apprentice or Bake-Off.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"msps-seek-clarification-512-250-payment-alex-salmond","story":"Permanent Secretary Lesley Evans, Scotlands most senior civil secretary, has already confirmed to MSPs that legal costs of more than pound, are \"routinely\" published online.But in a letter to MSPs who are examining how the Scottish Government handled misconduct allegations against the former SNP leader, Ms Evans said the payment of legal expenses to him \"had not yet been published by the Scottish Government as part of this routine process\".It was confirmed in August that the Government paid pound, in legal costs to the former first minister, after the Court of Session ruled the Governments handling of complaints made against him, which he denied, was \"unlawful\".:Scottish Conservatives back vote after Alex Salmond trialLinda Fabiani, convener of the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints, noted that while such information should be \"routinely published\", this \"is not in fact the case in this instance at the date of this committee meeting\".She confirmed the committee is seeking \"clarication\" on the matter.Having previously raised concerns that some documents could have been automatically deleted from the Scottish Governments computer storage system, the committee is also looking for more information about the Enterprise Vault system used by the administration.Ms Fabiani said this could contain \"information such as emails\" with these \"held for a year before deletion\"."},{"url":null,"title":"website-blunder-reveals-snp-fracking-decision","story":"SNP ministers had been due to announce they had finalised their policy against the controversial gas technology in a statement to MSPs tomorrow.However the development was accidentally published a day early on a government website.ldquoOn  October , the Scottish Government confirmed its final policy position of no support for unconventional oil and gas , it said.:MSPs seek lsquoclaricationrsquo over pound, payment to Alex SalmondHowever it remain unclear just how the Government intends to stop firms fracking long-term.A moratorium on councils issuing fracking licences has been in place since .Opposition parties at Holyrood want a permanent ban enshrined in legislation, meaning it could only be overturned by parliament.But ministers want to use a ldquostrong policy of non-support in the next National Planning Framework, warning companies it would be a waste of effort to apply for fracking licences.If a council went against the framework and granted a licence, ministers could call it in and refuse it on the basis of their policy.The same system is already used to create a de facto ban on building more nuclear power stations in Scotland.However a policy can be changed more easily than a legislative ban, and there are concerns a future Scottish Government could rewrite the rules.The next National Planning Framework, known as NPF, will also not be ready until .:SNP urged to live up to its rhetoric and ban frackingCritics say fracking, which involves pumping pressurised water and chemicals into underground shale beds to release natural gas, is a risk to climate change and public health.Advocates say it could support hundreds of new jobs and add millions to the economy.Ineos, which currently imports US shale gas to Grangemouth to use as a chemical industry feedstock, has long expressed an interest in fracking in Scotlands central belt.The Scottish Governmentrsquos preferred policy position has for several years been not to support fracking, but it has consulted repeatedly without coming to to a final position -

Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable. For items like tea bags, coffee grounds or banana skins, recycling food waste is a vital piece of the puzzle in tackling the climate emergency.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The public is being asked to look out for squirrels  both red and grey  for the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey. \"  \"  Join in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey this weekviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.falkirkherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Claire Gullan s to Banchory for her ceilidh workshop\"  Claire to teach “How to Ceilidh” viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"According to the Scottish Government’s  Scottish Household survey, only  per cent of Scottish households say they recycle their food waste, despite around  per cent having access to a food recycling caddy."},{"url":null,"title":"join in the great scottish squirrel survey this week","story":"People are being encouraged to look out for squirrels # and record their sightings # in support of the Saving Scotland#s Red Squirrels project.The Great Scottish Squirrel Survey takes place this week until Sunday, September .During this week – which coincides with National Red Squirrel Week – the public is being encouraged to spend some time exploring the outdoors while keeping a lookout for both red and grey squirrels.

With leaves falling they can be easier to spot as they move through the treetops, foraging for the autumn harvest of seeds, nuts and berries. They will also be spending more time on the ground, building up stores of food in preparation for the colder months ahead.Mel added: “During the survey week you could visit a well-known squirrel stomping ground to help us keep our records up-to-date. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Jon Marshall, Zero Waste Scotlands recycling sector manager, and chief executive Iain Gulland want recycled food waste to be used to power vehicles, just like the DeLorean car in the movie Back to the Future. \"  \"  Food waste really can power cars like in the s’ Back to the Future movies viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“Or,you’re feeling adventurous, you could visit a woodland where few sightings have been recorded before. “The more information we receive from the public, the better our understanding of Scotland’s squirrel populations will be.” Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmaker and Scottish Wildle Trust ambassador, said: “The red squirrel is an iconic Scottish species. “Thanks to conservation efforts their populations are beginning to stabilise, but their future is still under threat. “Taking part in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey is a really simple way you can help.”The results of the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey will be published later this year.

This OpenRoaming technology is being trailed in the county as part of the UK’s most ambitious testbed for connectivity in rural areas, in a project that aims demonstrate the potential and practical use cases that connectivity could bring to rural businesses.CloudNet, is enabling Orkney residents and tourists to use Cisco’s OpenRoaming services across key locations on the island including the ferries, ports, piers, distilleries and libraries. The trial is testing how handsets can provide a frictionless connected experience for residents and tourists in Orkney. G RuralFirst’s public Wi-Fi access network in Orkney is the first of its kind to support OpenRoaming in a live trial environment.OpenRoaming aims to combine the convenience of roaming with Wi-Fi connectivity. Users’ identities are authenticated once before they can access Wi-Fi without needing to login or register again. By linking access providers such as public venues, retailers, ports and offices, together with identity providers, such as carriers, devices and cloud services, OpenRoaming offers mobile users frictionless Wi-Fi onboarding.“OpenRoaming will change the way we connect to Wi-Fi and presents new opportunities for providers in a world where we expect high quality ubiquitous broadband access where ever we go,” said Dez O’Connor, Cisco and project CTO, G RuralFirst.“Customers tell us that Wi-Fi onboarding is a major pain point and there is a perception that it can be unreliable and insecure. OpenRoaming will transform the experience of using Wi-Fi into a seamless and positive one. As well as improving the connected experience for industries like tourism in Orkney, venues providing Wi-Fi to their customers will be able to use it as a means of engaging with them.”He added, “This trial shows the benefit of seamless connectivity in one of the most complex, challenging environments. It lays the foundations for many new WiFi solutions as our most innovative customers and partners join us to develop access networks and identity provider services across the UK and the rest of the world.”Around , tourists visit Orkney every year, making it a signicant contributor to the local economy. By making OpenRoaming services available to tourists, the G RuralFirst project aims to provide a fully connected experience for visitors to Orkney as well as its residents. Furthermore, Cisco say that there is a commercial opportunity for local tour operators and cruise ships through selling Wi-Fi packages which leverage OpenRoaming and augmented reality tourist applications across the island.The technology is also being used to support connected tourism by promoting Orkney Origins, an augmented reality app developed as part of G RuralFirst. The app provides digital tour guides of Orkney’s historic and picturesque sites via tourists’ smart devices, at access points. Tourists are able to download the app on the spot through OpenRoaming, rather than in advance of arriving, and be guided by digital avatars, creating a more memorable tourist experience and narrating the unique history of the Orkney Islands.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He stated that the application went against ious aspects of council planning policy. He had been seconded by Councillor Owen Tierney.Councillors then voted by ten votes to four to approve the development.• A planning application for the erection of   kV electricity substation at Dounreay, Caithness, which connects to the subsea cable across the Pentland Firth and forms part of the high voltage electricity transmission network and the “National Development”, was consented on September  by Highland Council.Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Westminster’s corrosive discussion style rewards smirk and smarm, sarcasm and grandiloquence. Ratings for the BBC Parliament channel have shot up. Many new viewers will find themselves nauseated by the baying.Bolshy tub-thumping does please a select audience. Those who rejoice in Brexit chaos and spread opportunistic lines of establishment shake-up, those who scream “traitors”, and those who require Gina Miller to have security protection. This is the Union Jack-clad contingent that has dragged the ‘debate’ further right and that more moderate eurosceptics have been unable to contain.: Edinburgh AUOB independence march organisers say , expected to attendFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereThe Scottish independence movement, in opposition to this, should find it easier this time around to offer a markedly dferent alternative. The drawbacks of belonging in the Union are more readily demonstrable, with logic and reason increasingly thin on the ground. In this light, Sturgeon’s reputation as level-headed, intelligent, and engaged is more than ever a massive asset to persuading former No voters over the line.In , her predecessor Alex Salmond’s palpable desire to ‘win’ a point, and the relish with which he appeared to be playing the game, was satisfying for those who already agreed with him and deeply irritating for those who didn’t. Some of those developing in Salmond’s mould have more than a little hint of that egotistical hubris, and it is unlikely to do the movement favours in the long run.No-ingJoanna Cherry’s excellent contribution to legal challenges to prorogation of Parliament has both shown her strengths as a QC and boosted her UK-wide profile. There’s ato the Court of Session in Edinburgh tomorrow in an attempt to compel Johnson to seek an extension to article , should no deal be agreed before  October. It could be another remarkable moment. This kind of expertise is also in stark contrast to Johnson’s circus antics and the last few years of rationality and common sense in Westminster being wilfully eroded and derided.So it seems self-defeating, but not entirely surprising, that Cherry is billed as speaking at Saturday’s All Under One Banner rally straight after her legal triumph. The bill also includes Tommy Sheridan, notoriously convicted of perjury and who has been promoting the event on Sputnik TV. SNP women politicians and campaign group Women For Independence have spoken on several occasions about refusing to share a stage with Sheridan following the acrimonious row with a group of women in the now-split Scottish Socialist Party. We know dissuaded women voters are an important target group for the campaign.: Boris Johnson warns Brexit delay will trigger  chaos and indyref: Why it’s wrong for SNP to talk about sending me ‘homeward’ – Luke Graham MPNo matter where you stand on the logistics of no-ing, and certainly Cherry has the right to speak alongside whomever she chooses, the biggest names repeatedly appearing on these line-ups hark back to both unsavoury episodes in Scottish politics and yesterday’s has-beens, and anchors the argument with glaring lack of credibility. Responding to these events is a tricky balance for independence parties, who can’t really ignore the many decent people who have the right to demonstrate support for independence by marching and who are bolstered by having a comradely day out, but ultimately, they’ve already been won. The campaign needs to win over the more sceptical, who are likely alienated by such displays.Also speaking at the event is Cherry’s frequent cheerleader, Chris McEleny, who has similarly engaged with wedge issues like the Gender Recognition Act while remaining reticent on abortion rights, as I wrote about back in May. Transpeople and women deeply deserve consensus and a way forward rather than a fanning of ision, and everyone deserves politics demonstrating common sense right now. As clueless as it getsOne day after celebrating Cherry’s success at the Supreme Court, McEleny replied to the tweet: “Question to all Scottish independence supporters slavering over Lady Hale. Would you be willing to break ‘the rule of law’ to achieve independence ” with the answer “Gandhi, Mandela, Dr King, Rosa Parks, Bruce, Wallace... all broke the law of the time.” With the threat of Johnson aiming to undermine the crucial judicial win, this is as clueless as it gets.Angus MacNeil, the Tweedledum to McEleny’s Tweedledee, has joined him in campaigning to push ahead with independence through a Section  order. A loud, obnoxious, and not particularly bright contingent has been banging drums of discontent for some time, praising ex-leader Salmond and disparaging Sturgeon’s slow and steady leadership style. The outcome of these combined interests will undoubtedly win them some personal fans from the party fringes, and sow a few seeds of dissatisfaction with current leadership who rightly demonstrate resistance to recklessness at this crucial moment. But in its petulance, impatience, and willingness to court minority interests to dent the more widespread appeal that the leadership has, it is the exact opposite of what the Yes campaign now requires.The landscape has been fundamentally changed. The Yes campaign needs only gesture in the direction of the calamity that has ensued to show how promises by the No campaign have been turned on their head or shown to be hollow. The focus now must be, very specically, on the voters who opposed independence in  but who are horried at Brexit and rampant populism, and to present a sensible and credible alternative, argued strongly but calmly, looking secure and in control. This is exactly Sturgeon’s lane, and it’s exactly the opposite of taking a microphone after Sheridan has shouted into it.People are so tired of populists. They’re tired of those who sow ision, of reckless grandstanding, and of politics being spat out with fury rather than calmly negotiated. They’re tired of blunt stupidity. They’re tired of flags. Scottish voters who desire to remain in the EU are aghast at what has transpired and they don’t want more in the vein of self-serving, table-thumping bombast. Children expect immediate gratication, but slow and steady will win this race.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish unicorn knocked off buckingham palace gates by delivery lorry","story":"They said: ldquoWe can confirm an incident took place yesterday morning where a lorry damaged the North Centre Gate at Buckingham Palace. window.twttr The North Centre Gate is used as the main vehicle access to Buckingham Palace, with the adjacent Central Gate reserved primarily for state and ceremonial occasions.: UK handing control of Edinburgh Castle to Scotland was a mistake, says Tory MP ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"snp opposition parties squabble over best way to block no deal brexit","story":"Co-operation between opposition parties seeking to block a no-deal Brexit is close to breaking point in a disagreement over tactics to bring down Boris Johnson and trigger a snap election.Opposition leaders failed to agree on the timing of a vote of no confidence when they met earlier this week, delaying any bid to oust Mr Johnson from Downing Street, and the parties failed to secure any emergency debates to put pressure on ministers over Brexit this week.Frustration boiled over last night, with sources in the SNP and the Liberal Democrats mounting a briefing against each other.The SNP is pushing for a swt election, while Labour and the Lib Dems want to wait until legislation delaying the UK’s Brexit date takes effect on  October.The parties are also at odds over whether to allow Jeremy Corbyn to lead a caretaker government of national unity that would request a delay from Brussels and call an election, with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson standing firm against letting Mr Corbyn into No .“There is a deep sense of frustration in the SNP that the cross-party meetings aren’t going anywhere, that no meaningful action is being taken, and there is a concern that Brexit could end up happening because of a failure of leadership,” a Nationalist source said.“The SNP has presented their plan but the Lib Dems are acting as a roadblock and no credible alternative has been presented. What started as a constructive process that achieved results is going nowhere.”A Lib Dem source hit back: “The only people who currently think a vote of no confidence is a good idea are the SNP and Boris Johnson.“They are putting their desire for an election above what is good for the country, which is a totally reckless course of action.“A vote of no confidence now would make no-deal more likely, not less, which is why the other opposition parties have agreed it is not the best course of action right now.”Meanwhile, at Prime Minister’s Questions, the SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford made a public call for opposition parties to unite and “bring this dangerous government down”.He urged opposition MPs to “step up at this moment of national crisis” to “prepare a vote of no confidence, ensure a Brexit extension, prevent a no deal and call a general election”.Mr Blackford said: “This government must be stopped. I’m looking now at colleagues on opposition benches and I urge them we must unite, we must stop this Prime Minister by removing him from office.Standing in for Mr Johnson at PMQs, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab accused Mr Blackford of “sounding like he’s all mouth and no trousers”.Mr Raab added that “he had the chance to vote for a general election and he turned it down, he had the chance to avoid no deal and the best chance now is to back this government in securing a good deal”.Referring to the government’s fresh Brexit proposals, Mr Blackford said Mr Johnson’s “Brexit fantasy” was an “unacceptable” deal and “doomed to failure”.He said: “Is this government seriously planning to take on Parliament in the courts to force through a catastrophic no-deal Brexit or will the Foreign Secretary now rule that out ”Mr Raab replied: “Of course this government will always adhere to the law... we want to take forward the negotiations, we want to avoid a no-deal scenario and actually rather than undermine the negotiations in Brussels, I’d urge the SNP to try and support the government in securing a deal which is good for this country.”Mr Raab called on the SNP to respect the “judgment of the people of Scotland when it comes to staying in the UK and the judgment of the people of the UK to give effect to the referendum on the EU”.The SNP has been urging Labour and the Lib Dems to agree on a compromise candidate to lead a national unity government following a vote of no confidence.But with Labour insisting that the candidate has to be Mr Corbyn, and the Lib Dems and Conservative rebels implacably opposed, the talks have made little progress.Mr Blackford told BBC Radio Scotland: “I do think there is a danger we run out of time, because when we call a motion of no confidence we have  days to put an administration in place. Once we get to the middle of October the options for us are beginning to close off.“Everyone has to accept their responsibility. We are willing to do our part to bring Boris Johnson down - why are the other parties not prepared to do what is necessary to remove this man from office “We are not prepared to sit back and let Scotland be dragged off the clf edge by Boris Johnson.”He said allowing a no-deal Brexit would be a collective failure by the opposition.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"queen sought advice on sacking prime minister source claims","story":"The monarch reportedly asked aides for first time in her reign just how and when should could dismiss a PM.The Queen sought advice on the circumstances in which she could sack a prime minister ahead of Tuesday’s incendiary Supreme Court ruling, i has been told.A source claims that the monarch asked her aides for the first time for clarication on just when and how she could dismiss a prime minister who refuses to step aside.The alleged consultations reinforce suggestions that the monarch and her most senior aides had deep concerns about Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue Parliament, even before the country’s most senior court was asked to declare the move unlawful.It was reported on Sunday that Mr Johnson phoned the Queen to personally apologise for the embarrassment caused by the crushing Supreme Court ruling that he had acted unlawfully when he advised the monarch to suspend Parliament for five weeks - advice which she was obliged to accept.: Johnson refuses to confirm he apologised to the Queen​ Constitutional crisisi has now been told that the Queen personally asked for advice on the constitutional circumstances in which she can effectively sack a prime minister.Under the rules of the British constitution the Queen can only \"advise, encourage and warn\" ministers. It is suggested that the monarch has sought her own advice on the circumstances in which she could dismiss a prime minister. Columnist Ian Birrell reports in Monday’s paper: “One well-placed source told me the Queen had, for the first time in her reign, sought advice on sacking a prime minister before the Supreme Court verdict.”Buckingham Palace said on Sunday that it did not comment on rumours.It is understood that while there have been discussions between Downing Street and the Palace about the constitution and the Queen’s role, it would not be the case that the monarch would take it upon herself to dismiss a prime minister or advise him or her to step down.However, i understands that any discussions did not relate to an active attempt by the Queen and her most senior advisors to sack Mr Johnson.: Why the Queen made an error of judgement on proroguing Parliament – Joyce McMillan Legal positionHaving been embarrassed by the Supreme Court’s ruling that the prorogation of Parliament was unlawful, it is likely the Queen would not want to be caught out again, and would want to know her exact legal position should she be approached by opposition MPs in the event of Mr Johnson refusing to step aside after losing a vote of no confidence.It is a quirk of the British constitution that the Queen retains a number of personal discretionary powers which include the right to appoint the prime minister and other ministers. A House of Commons select committee established in  that these powers also include a right for the sovereign in a “grave constitutional crisis” to act contrary to, or even without, ministerial advice.The Queen has been dragged into a constitutional crisis by Boris Johnson over decision to prorogue ParliamentConstitutional experts are indeed ided on the exact circumstances -any - in which the Queen could remove a sitting prime minister.In the event that Mr Johnson lost a vote of no-confidence in Parliament, there would follow a -day period in which MPs can vote to put forward a candidate to replace him.Drag out proceedingsSome experts believe that only in the circumstances in which it could be shown by Parliament that an alternative prime minister can muster a majority, the Queen could require Mr Johnson to resign.Others, however, argue that the Fixed Terms Parliament Act allows a sitting prime minister to recommend an election date after that -day period and therefore Mr Johnson could drag out proceedings in the absence of a clear power for the monarch to dismiss him.The Queen has hitherto scrupulously avoided the use of any of her discretionary powers unless explicitly advised to do so by ministers.She has also been careful to avoid being seen to adopt a position on any political matters. Consequently, the claim by David Cameron that he sought the Queen’s intervention during the Scottish referendum campaign has been reportedly the source of further displeasure in Buckingham Palace.This story originally appeared in the i. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scotrail told to change misleading fare adverts by watchdog","story":"ScotRail has been asked by the Advertising Standards Authority to change #potentially misleading# adverts that implied the cheapest tickets could be found on its website.An ex-transport chief had complained that passengers could get lower fares on some routes by taking advice on splitting tickets at booking offices.George Eckton, a former director of the South East of Scotland Transport Partnership coordinating body, said he hoped it would improve awareness of lower fares.The Advertising Standards Authoritytold him: “We’ve assessed the ad you highlighted and, from the information we have, we think it likely to have breached the Advertising Codes we administer.” An ASA spokeswoman said: “Following receipt of this complaint, we assessed the ads in question and wrote to the advertiser to outline the changes they needed to make in accordance with our rules.“The complainant was concerned the advertiser’s claims on their website for ‘best fare’ and ‘best value’ were potentially misleading as he could book his ticket at a ticket office, split his journey and achieve a cheaper price.“We offered the advertiser guidance and advice to ensure their advertising complies with the Advertising Codes.“Taking action of this kind, rather than going down the route of a formal investigation, is an option available to us depending on resources and prioritisation.”Mr Eckton said: “I welcome the ASA action. I hope it gives all consumers the opportunity to have greater awareness of the best fares, and places the onus on train companies to do more to market in a clear and transparent manner within the dficulties of the current fare structure.“I am just as an ordinary citizen trying to get a fare system that is fair for all.”Mr Eckton has also launched a petition at the Scottish Parliament requiring “customers to be given information on the cheapest possible fare as a matter of course”. This would include future ScotRail operators offering an app to show the lowest price option for a trip.SNP MSP John Mason, co-convener of the Scottish Parliament’s cross-party rail group, called for greater clarity on fares.He said: “I welcome any improvements to the present system by way of better advertising or the way tickets are sold.“However, we need to fix the fundamental problem that it should never be cheaper to buy two tickets in place of one. “No one has explained to me satisfactorily why this is happening.”A spokesperson for Transport Scotland, which oversees the ScotRail franchise, said: “We thank Mr Eckton for raising this matter and we are aware ScotRail has taken action to resolve it.”ScotRail said it had been encouraged to amend the wording of its ads to clary that the prices were the best value offered through its website, as consumers might be able to achieve a cheaper price through other booking means.Its spokesperson said: “We’re working with the ASA to ensure information on the best value fares on our website and customer communications is clear, concise and not misleading in any way.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree.

Planning permission was granted in  and received approval from elected representatives on Belfast City Council having gone through all of the requisite planning procedures.The plans have been signicantly revised three times following consultation, resulting in a final plan which meets the school’s needs while making provision for extensive landscaped open space facilities for local residents.The sports provision as planned will occupy under fty per cent of the land available with the remainder proposed as a managed landscape development. In a letter addressed to FOGOG dated September , Mr Baker states that the project needs to proceed “within the approved plans”.“While there is no scope to amend the plans in these areas, the Department’s view remains that there are still a number of other areas where engagement between the residents and the school would be of great value.“As you are aware, a contractor is in place for this project and is ready to start on site.“As I stated at the meeting, it is the Department’s preference that this project can proceed in a manner that will benefit both the school and the community and I would urge you to consider the offer being made in a positive manner.”FOGOG have occupied Glassmullin green since August  when contractors, Haffey Sports Grounds, were due to begin work on the project. FOGOG have campaigned for the protection of the green space since , and described attempts to develop on the site as a “land grab”.De La Salle College have reiterated on several occasions that it has engaged in “considerable” and exhaustive “consultations” and modied plans three times to take into account the wishes of residents whilst still benefitting its pupils and “the whole community”.In his letter Derek Baker stated that there were four specic areas “where it will not be possible to make amendments”. Those areas are:•G pitch – following consultation in the earlier stages of this project, the size of the pitch has already been reduced. The current approved plan is for a m x m pitch, which is the minimum requirement to enable the school to have a useful facility for the delivery of the PE curriculum.School•Fencing – As you will appreciate, safeguarding of the De La Salle pupils is paramount, so the pitch needs a level of fencing. This will also have the benefit of protecting residents’ homes from stray balls.•Floodlighting – One of the key aspects of this project is that the pitch is available for community use outside of school hours and floodlighting is required to allow the community to maximize its use of the facility. While the provision of floodlights is central to the project, there is scope to review the hours of operation of the lights.•Pavilion – The pavilion is required for both school and community use and has already been reduced in size. It is simply not possible to further reduce the size of the pavilion and still have a facility, which meets the needs of the school and the community.However, in his communication to FOGOG, Mr Baker said that there are “still a number of areas” where engagement between the residents and the school “would be of great value”. The main areas are:•Hours of use of the facility•Sources of funding and the charging policy for community use of the facility•Landscaping of the Council area and•Nature of the G surface.Senior De La Salle College representatives told the Andersonstown News that the school “has always been and is still willing” to engage with FOGOG.“There has been extensive consultation on this project since it was first announced in January . As of September  the Department received an acknowledgement from FOGOG that they are considering the letter sent from Derek Baker and will be in touch in due course.“The delay on the project is costing thousands of pounds and this project will begin within the coming weeks.“We have made repeated efforts to engage, we want FOGOG to talk to us. Essentially these contractors have to go back onsite. This is a real passion for us. To provide this type of sports provision for the children, for the community.“It is important to stress that we want the community to be part of the management process of this project and we have extended several invitations for residents to join the Glassmullin Management Committee. The vision has always been co-ownership of this project and that remains as such.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"jobs saved at harland and wolff as bid for shipyard accepted","story":"A financial bid for Harland and Wolff shipyard has been accepted following a nine-week occupation by its staff.The site has been bought for a total of £ million by InfraStrata, a London-based energy firm.

Unite regional officer Susan Fitzgerald said the workers had “defied the cynics”.SDLP Councillor Brian Heading welcomed news that a buyer had been found.Cllr Heading spearheaded efforts to bring together a coalition of public agencies to secure the shipyard after it fell into administration.“At last the shipyard workers have some positive news. They have fought tooth and nail to defend their livelihoods but also to secure one of Belfast’s most iconic industries.

Spectators got good value for their money and I think this has brought Antrim football up another level.“It was a nail-biting finish – exactly like the last one, two teams who were highly motivated and prepared.“The dference I thought tonight was that no team was prepared to concede. The character of our own team was great because we were trailing for long stages of the match and I think both teams were a bit wasteful towards the end, but the main thing coming out of this was the drama.”Portglenone boss Barry Dillon believes the GAA should look at the policy of replays going to shootoutsrequired as it places unnecessary pressure on players, especially at club level.He was full of praise for the efforts of both teams who again emptied the tank, so this evening’s second replay could come down to who has sufficiently recovered from Thursday’s exertions.“The rules say it has to be decided, but the chairman stopped in and explained his side of it, saying that boys don#t need to be put under that kind of pressure,” he said.“I wouldn#t be for frees in the first place. A game should be won on the football pitch and not by hitting frees.“If someone was to miss a free for either team in that situation, it would be a big cross to bear to miss out on a county final like that.#You couldn#t have written the way it worked out – nine-all after free-kicks and the county chairman intervenes.#It#s great to be involved in games like that, seeing boys giving their all and the two games have been amazing.#Thursday’s game came at a huge cost for Lámh Dhearg as Pearse Fitzsimons was stretchered off with a suspected cruciate knee injury.They are still awaiting confirmation on the extent of his injury, but he certainly misses out tonight.Both teams have had little time to recover ahead od this evening’s third installment of this semi-final saga, but there will be no backward step from either as they aim to join Cargin in Sunday’s final.“We just have to go back and prepare properly,” added Lynch.“We#re up for it, we#re not prepared to concede and inch and neither are they, so it will be another great game for Antrim football.”All proceeds of this evening’s game will be split between deterMND, Paul McKeever’s Cancer Focus NI and Friends of Cancer Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in stand off with contractors at glassmullin green","story":"CAMPAIGNERS opposed to the development of a new sports facility at Glassmullin Green have continued to occupy the space as contractors attempted to move on site this morning.Education NI has provided £.million for the project, which would see a G pitch, car park and pavilion built for De La Salle College.Work was initially due to begin on August , with Contractors Haffey Sports Grounds leaving the site following intervention from the Friends of Glassmullin Open Green , who have campaigned to protect the green space since .FOGOG have occupied the site for the past seven weeks and have opposed today#s attempts by contractors to begin work on the development.La Salle has previously faced accusations of failing to properly engage with residents, who have described the plans as a #land grab#.

Unplanned is based on the memoir of Abby Johnson, formerly a pro-choice advocate who is now opposed to abortion. It was the fourth-highest grossing film in the US on its opening weekend and it took in m at the box office in its first fortnight. It tells the story of Johnson, who, for eight years, had worked for Americas leading reproductive health organisation Planned Parenthood. She experienced a dramatic change of heart after witnessing a medical termination. In a statement, a spokesperson for Stanton Healthcare NI said: \"We are delighted that this movie will hit the cinema screens across the whole of Ireland, north and south. We have invited many political leaders across Northern Ireland to our special screenings in Belfast, Cookstown and Strabane.\"There is a huge public demand to see this movie, and the cinemas have responded - the people have been heard. At this moment in history, the public have the right to see the truth behind the abortion industry, and the harm it causes to both the mother and the baby. This is exactly what Unplanned unveils. No matter which side of the fence you’re on, no one will leave this film unmoved by Abby’s journey.  \"This personal drama of le-and-death encounters, speaks hope and compassion into the political controversy that surrounds the issue of abortion, especially at this time when abortion is looming over Northern Ireland. The film has been endorsed by many high-profile figures including Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Ted Cruz, who was the runner-up for the Republican nomination in the  presidential election. In a letter to Brunswick Moviebowl in Londonderry seen by the Belfast , Alliance for Choice supporter Shannon Downey said: \"With the current situation in Northern Ireland meaning that decriminalisation of abortion will occur on st October , Brunswick Moviebowl is making a political statement by screening ‘Unplanned’ and therefore saying to the  women from our communities who travel to England for abortion care every year that their business is not welcome at Brunswick Moviebowl.\"In the scene that Abby Johnsons character describes as \"the moment that changed everything\", a -week-old foetus is shown \"twisting and fighting for its le\". \"In this scene the fetus attempts to ‘move away’ from the doctor’s medical instrument. This representation is grossly inaccurate and biologically impossible,\" said Ms Downey.  \"Both the American College and Royal Colleges of Obstetricians and Gynaecologist affirm that a fetus does not have the capacity to perceive pain or possess sentience until at least  weeks gestation.\"\"In this film, Planned Parenthood is depicted as a for-profit abortion business. In fact, Planned Parenthood is a non-profit that provides a iety of sexual and reproductive healthcare to millions across the United States. Abortion makes up just .% of its services.\"Choosing to screen this film not only shames women but supplies dangerous myths and lies. I would urge you to reconsider showing this propaganda as it is endangering the women in your community,\" she said. The ODEON and Brunswick MovieBowl have been approached for a comment.   "},{"url":null,"title":"queens university regrets past use of gay aversion therapy","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining. Amongst its lyrics: \"Whats more precious than gold \"The land, the sea, the air that we breathe, thats more precious than gold.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the UNISON presentation to council and we look forward to working closely with them in the future.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: DCSDC Health and Community Committee and UNISON Community Branch Activists."},{"url":null,"title":"newtown volunteers working around clock look kittens","story":"There are more kittens to be adopted in Newtown.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensNewtown Cats Protection is looking for people to adopt kittens.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensMore kittens are in need of adoption in Newtown.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensOne of the kittens up for adoption Newtown.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensNewtown Cats Protection staff are hoping to see more kittens adopted.\" Volunteers working #around the clock# to look after kittensCats protection logo.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"newtown youngsters strike climate change","story":"Climate Strike at the Town Hall Grounds Newtown organised by Jasmine Jones, Rubyltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt White and Lyssie Jaltspan classtruncate-full-screengtrvis last Friday th September..Pictured left to right, Kylie DaviesSophie WeaverRuby White, Lyssie Jarvisalt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Newtown youngsters strike about climate changeClimate Strike at the Town Hall Grounds Newtown organised by Jasmine Jones, Rubyltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt White and Lyssie Jaltspan classtruncate-full-screengtrvis last Friday th September..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Newtown youngsters strike about climate changeClimate Strike at the Town Hall Grounds Newtown organised by Jasmine Jones, Rubyltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt White and Lyssie Jaltspan classtruncate-full-screengtrvis last Friday th September..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"unique mix entertainment offer bishops castles michaelmas fair","story":"Barrel organ player, Dave Hill entertains crowds at this year#s Michaelmas Fltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtair.

By comparison, the plaintf has been estimated in the recent past to have a turnover of poundm and is the third largest snack manufacturer in the UK, the lawyer said.Mr Morgan claimed that a public judgment against the defendant would be more valuable to the crisps company than a prolonged investigation into what profits Candy Plus made from selling Irish Tayto.He also disclosed that his client was willing to make a pound payment as part of any settlement.However, the court heard it was being wrongly portrayed as a ldquoDavid and Goliath case.Mr Hopkins challenged the lack of evidence to back assertions Mr Ferris only made pound profit from the trademark infringement.Entering judgment for Tayto Northern Ireland, Mr Justice Huddleston said: ldquoI fully accept this case is not at the higher end of the scale of either culpability or breach, but nonetheless itrsquos a breach and for that consequences do follow.Awarding costs to the company and remitting the case to a High Court master for further financial examinations, Mr Justice Huddleston added: ldquoUntil therersquos an assessment of damages or an account of profits we are at a loss..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Doors.jpg","title":"Doors to close at primary school  ","story":"THE death knell has been sounded for Castlewellan Primary School.The beleaguered school, which currently has only eight pupils, will close by the end of August next year at the earliest.The Education Authority yesterday sent out letters announcing that it had approved a proposal to close the school along with its Moderate Learning Dficulty class.There will now be a two-month period for objectors to make their views known, after which a final decision will be taken.School principal Niall McLean said yesterday: ldquoIt is highly regrettable that it has come to this, but we have to face reality.The school, which has been in existence for  years, has been experiencing falling enrolment numbers for several years.The school has capacity for  pupils and of the eight children currently on the register, six are in the Moderate Learning Dficulty class and two in the P-P class.

Other suggestions included utilising part of the walled garden for public use, in particular, outdoor concerts.As council officials prepare to unveil the blueprint for the future of the country park, work is continuing to overhaul and extend the Education Authorityrsquos base in the grounds of the country park which is used to deliver a iety of outdoor courses.Several years ago, the building was earmarked for closure by education chiefs as part of a rationalisation of outdoor youth provision. But it secured a reprieve as a result of pressure from local politicians, including Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews.Contractors are currently hard at work restoring and extending the facility which commands spectacular views over the country park from the front of the building and Strangford Lough from the rear.Cllr Walker, who for many years has been campaigning for more investment in the country park to provide an enhanced range of attractions for visitors, said many people were looking forward to seeing the councilrsquos future vision for Delamont.He said the country park was one of the best of its kind in the province and offered ldquounlimited development potential.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoIt is important that when the vision for the future is unveiled that local people are given an opportunity to study the document and provide comment on it.ldquoThe Education Authority stuck to its promise to invest in Delamont and it is important that the local council presses ahead with its own investment plan to make Delamont even better, capitalising on its huge development potential.Delamont currently operates a hugely successful miniature railway, cafe, stunning walks and childrenrsquos adventure playground, but Cllr Walker believes so much more can be done.He added: ldquoWhile I am not advocating that the beauty of the area is spoiled in any way, there are hundreds of acres of space which could be used to boost the parkrsquos tourism offering.ldquoSecuring finance to enhance the country park is critical to its future development and I hope others funders will join with the council on this issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Resurfacing.jpg","title":"Resurfacing work set to start in Irish Street  ","story":"WORK to resurface Irish Street in Downpatrick following the completion of a pound, public realm scheme is expected to start imminently.Roads officials have indicated that concerns about the state of a derelict building close to the townrsquos former police base have been addressed, paving the way for resurfacing work to start.It was revealed last month that the project had been delayed due to issues over insurance and that the work could not take place until these are resolved.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he has been told by roads officials that concerns about the derelict building have been ironed out and that resurfacing work will begin.Work on the regeneration project was due to be completed by March, but it was the end of June before contractors finally moved off site, with traders in the area expressing anger about the impact the delayed scheme was having on business.The delay also had a knock-on effect on traffic congestion in other parts of the town as a result of the temporary one-way traffic system in Irish Street.Managed by the Departments for Infrastructure and Communities and Newry Mourne and Down Council, the scheme has resulted in new granite paving, street lighting and street furniture.The delay in completing the public realm work within the anticipated three-month timeframe was blamed on a number of factors, described as ldquounforeseen works issues, that resulted in the loss of construction time and delays in delivering the scheme.Issues which arose included the identication of asbestos piping along both sides of Irish Street which resulted in the works contract being put on hold for eight weeks. In addition, the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI base posed construction issues for contractors.Cllr Curran said that while the Irish Street scheme was ldquobeset by problems and delays it was important to look forward.ldquoA lot of water has passed under the bridge since a one-way traffic system was introduced in Irish Street at the start of the year. While a number of factors delayed the project, it is important that work on the resurfacing scheme is now completed, he continued.ldquoIrish Street offers so much potential, both for the businesses located there and people who live at this very historic part of the town. The street has been transformed as a result of signicant investment which was long overdue.Cllr Curran said a new group was formed in July to oversee a pound, scheme to help revitalise shop fronts at Irish Street, with the so-called lsquorevitalisation fundingrsquo provided by the Department for Communities and local authority to help business owners improve the fronts of their respective properties.A working group to steer the project forward has been formed, with traders encouraged to come up with schemes to improve shop fronts.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThis is a timely initiative given what the Irish Street traders had to endure for the first six months of the year. It is also important that whatever schemes come forward that the character of this part of the town is retained.ldquoThere are also plans for an ambitious multi-million pound regeneration initiative via the redevelopment of the townrsquos former police base and a number of adjacent empty buildings. This means that the spotlight will be on Irish Street for the foreseeable future.As part of the planned commercial development, the townrsquos former police base, which enjoys protected status, could be utilised as an attractive entrance feature.Local council officials say they are excited at the development potential the Irish Street site offers and want to maximise its development opportunity..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th September 2019 Saintfield.jpg","title":"Saintfield’s recent run ended by Rosemount  ","story":"SAINTFIELD United ed to Pigeon Hill on Saturday looking to make it three league wins in a row, but it wasnrsquot to be as Rosemount Rec where eventually able to leave with the spoils.The Saints started the game brightly and in the opening minutes created a few opportunities, but against the run of play Rosemount took the lead when their number nine cut in from the left and found the bottom corner.From then on, Rosemount started to dominate possession and they found a second when a long-range effort found the bottom corner.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a long waiting list.ldquoWe have to make sure these are properties we have finance for and they are up to our standards as well. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen.

They must know that there are real-world consequences from dangerous language.I have many friends who took a respectful and dferent view from me on Brexit. Like the overwhelming majority of Welsh and British people, they are perfectly capable of expressing that view without resorting to threats, aggression or violence.We must all learn to disagree well, however robust our views and remember that we all share this country and this planet - and that we genuinely have more in common.Meanwhile, it has been another extraordinary week in these turbulent political times.After we had the shock news that I wrote about last week ndash that the Supreme Court had delivered a unanimous judgement that Parliament should not have been shut down by the PM ndash we were able to go back immediately.I was straight back to Westminster having meetings with colleagues, holding the government to account, and of course getting back to work not just on Brexit but on many other issues.I was able to raise concerns in the Commons on behalf of constituents relating to the Thomas Cook collapse, which has affected everybody from holiday-makers to pilots to holiday reps and retail workers in the constituency and to call for a debate on the incineration of waste.And on Monday, I joined Allied Steel and Wire Pensioners from the constituency, and others hit by pensions theft, to hand in a petition to the Prime Minister at  Downing Street.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"around  jobs lost as wrightbus enters administration","story":"Posted on Wednesday  September  by John Mulgrew Around , jobs have been lost after Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus entered administration. The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.

Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election.
