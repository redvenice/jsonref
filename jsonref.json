She was sentenced to 28 days in prison in her absence.Judge Godsmark QC found that seven out of the nine breaches presented by the council had been proven beyond all reasonable doubt.Neal was sentenced to 28 days in prison for the most serious breach of spraying weed killer over the fence.           Recent CCTV footage begins by showing Mrs Brookes walking over to put plant pots back upShe was also given 14 days for the other breaches - to run concurrently with the 28 days.The judge gave a lengthy judgement, stating that he \u0027was left with the overwhelming impression that Mrs Neal is not taking the injunction seriously\u0027 and that, while the last thing that the court wanted to do was send an elderly woman to prison, there was little else left to do.The judge also warned that the court would have little choice but to impose the full suspended eight-month prison sentence should further breaches occur. Neal was ordered to pay the council\u0027s legal costs of £4,323.

Jail is a last resort but in this case nothing else has worked, including the countless warnings and fines.          Neal is caught on CCTV walking away from the fence after pushing the plant pots over again\u0027We hope that this short prison sentence will make Neal realise the seriousness of her crimes and bring an end to this matter. \u0027We\u0027re pleased with the court\u0027s decision and thank the police for their hard work alongside NWLDC\u0027s community safety and legal teams for bringing about this successful prosecution.\u0027Inspector Richard Jackson, from North West Leicestershire neighbourhood policing area, said: \u0027No one should live in fear of their neighbour and unfortunately Neal has repeatedly refused to put a stop to her campaign of harassment and abide by the injunction.\u0027This left no other option but to go back to court as part of the legal process and as a very last resort.

to surrender last month but skipped the deadline and police were forced to pursue him He went on the run as his reputation - which had been built up over several decades - was tarnished.Court documents show that he had attempted to withdraw nearly £6.8m before surrendering to police on charges of rape. The elderly medium, who has been interviewed by Oprah and has treated Bill Clinton, was pursued after skipping a deadline to hand himself in.According to a video released by the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo, Faria said: \u0027I surrender to ine justice and justice on Earth.\u0027Police say they discovered a suitcase crammed with £230,000 worth of Brazilian reals and bunches of emeralds they have yet to appraise in his home.Representatives for the law office representing Faria have decline to comment on the case.He denies all of the charges against him. Faria rose to international fame for his \u0027psychic surgeries\u0027 that he claimed could cure diseases, including cancer.He gained international exposure in 2010 when Oprah Winfrey visited his retreat to interview him for her talk show and described an experience with him as \u0027blissful.\u0027In a since-deleted column

TV network they were abused too on the premise of transferring his \u0027cleansing\u0027 energy, according to BBC. Some said they were seeking a cure for their depression and sexual assault trauma when the alleged abuse took place.Mous said she went to the Abadiania centre in 2014 seeking healing from the trauma of her previous sexual abuses.During her second visit she was told she was chosen to have a private consultation with Faria.She recounted that she was told \u0027You feel special\u0027, according to Folha de São Paulo.In that horrific second session she claims Faria came close to her, smelled her skin and asked her to stand with her back facing him and led her to a bathroom. Once there he allegedly touched her genitals and forced her to have anal sex.She said didn\u0027t run away because she wanted to be trained as a medium at the centre. She overcame her self-denial four years later. \u0027I was terrified of them sending bad spirits in my direction, wrecking my life that

One is wearing back coloring on his hands and face, along with plaid pants and a bowtie, a white Panama hat, and sungasses.The other inidual is wearing a makeshift white hood and robe in the style of the Ku Klux Klan. Both men are holding beers. Under the photo, text states that Northam\u0027s alma mater is the Virginia Military Institute and that his interest is pediatrics.His quote is given as: \u0027There are more old drunks than old doctors in this world so I think I\u0027ll have another beer.\u0027 The photo was first circulated on Friday afternoon by the conservative news site Big League Politics, which viewed it in the school\u0027s library. Other outlets were able to independently view and confirm the photo. The photo was revealed after Northam, who took office last year, made national headlines earlier in the week with remarks supporting late-term abortion up until labor.            Republican state Senator Bryce Reeves said in a statement that Northam should resign if the reports of the photos are accurate.\u0027I hope that this picture is inaccurate and that the Governor brings clarity to this issue.

The Governor of Virginia should step aside so the public can heal and move forward together,\u0027 Harris wrote on Twitter.           Another contender for the Democratic nomination, Julian Castro, joined the call, calling the image of Northam \u0027racist and unconscionable\u0027. If Northam were to resign, Lt. Governor Justin Fairfax, who is African-American, would assume the governor\u0027s office.For now, Northam\u0027s close allies in Virginia have stopped short of calling for resignation.In a statement, the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus said that \u0027what has been revealed is disgusting, reprehensible, and offensive.\u0027 The group stopped short of calling for resignation, saying it was \u0027still processing\u0027 the revelation.Last week, Florida\u0027s Republican secretary of state resigned after photos from a 2005 Halloween party showed him in blackface while dressed as a Hurricane Katrina victim.During his election campaign, Northam repeatedly labeled his Republican opponent Ed Gillespie as \u0027racist\u0027.One campaign commercial, funded by the Latino Victor Fund SuperPAC, depicted a white man in a pickup truck with a Gillespie bumper sticker attempting to run down non-white children.\u0027VA is an inclusive and erse community—we won\u0027t put up with Ed Gillespie\u0027s racist rhetoric and fearmongering,\u0027 Northam wrote in an October 2017 tweet. "},{"url":null,"title":"JOHN MANN MP Bassetlaw Labour voting Brexit supporting constituencies","story":"    Let’s get one thing straight: I voted for Brexit and I backed Mrs May’s Brexit deal in the Commons on Tuesday, and will carry on backing it regardless.

They voted for Brexit expecting things to get better once we are out. But the reality is that they will not be able to enjoy the opportunities unless we get help from central government.          Pro-Brexit demonstrators protest outside the Houses of Parliament, in Westminster, LondonMuch of the Labour criticism of me came from Remainer fanatics who want to overturn the referendum. People like Redcar Labour MP Anna Turley who said the Prime Minister was ‘trying to bribe former mining towns to get her Brexit deal through’.(By the way, according to statistics from the House of Commons library, her Redcar constituency voted to Leave with a massive 67.7 per cent voting to break from Brussels).Like Redcar in North Yorkshire, Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire was devastated by the pit closures. If I get my way, Redcar will benefit as much as Bassetlaw from the new government aid we are demanding.

He wrote on Twitter about those who came with me to Downing Street: ‘Socialists my a***. Cowards and facilitators. History will be brutal.’I have never noticed David not trying to get more money for his constituents – and to suggest we are not good socialists is nonsense. We have told the Prime Minister we want more of the nation’s wealth redistributed from better-off areas – including parts of London which have done very nicely, thank you, in recent times – to the North and Midlands. I don’t know about David Lammy, but I call that socialism in action.Pro-Remain Labour MP, Wes Streeting of Ilford North in London, meanwhile, said we were ‘aligning ourselves with Boris Johnson’ and that our actions ‘would never be forgiven’.          A sculpture depicting Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May stands opposite Parliament as the protest against Brexit continuous in London in December 2018 Well, the likes of Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg will be fine whatever happens after Brexit.It will never be as easy for my constituents – which is why I told the Prime Minister that Brexit presents a great opportunity for national renewal.Wisely, Jeremy Corbyn has not joined in the chorus of accusation about ‘bribery’.He said we were right to ‘demand appropriate resources for (our) constituencies … particularly from mining areas’.  A vocal Labour critic was pro-EU  MP David Lammy (pictured). He tweeted about those who came with me to Downing Street: ‘Socialists my a***. Cowards and facilitators. History will be brutal.’I freely acknowledge it is a strange feeling as a loyal Labour MP to be invited to No10 to sit down and negotiate directly with a Conservative Prime Minister. And it is not only the door to No10 that is open. Like trade union leaders last week, we have had access to a number of other departments in my search for firm commitments on workers’ rights, environmental protection and other issues important to my constituents.For a start, we need to use the money that came to Britain via the EU’s regional aid fund, but will now stay in Treasury coffers, to rebuild the most deprived areas, which are nearly all Labour seats. This must be a multi-billion-pound, game-changing project: new transport schemes, science parks, high-tech projects, housing developments.It should be a national fund to rebuild Britain, focusing on industrial towns like mine in the North and Midlands, and some coastal towns that voted to leave the EU partly because they have not had a fair deal from successive governments over the years. We want serious money ploughed into our areas. We aren’t trying to achieve a seat-by-seat deal.So yes, we are using the Prime Minister’s need for our support on Brexit to try to get a better deal for our constituencies – and I will not apologise for that.When we met Mrs May, she told us she had always been committed to tackling inequality between communities, and wanted to promote prosperity in areas like ours.We will judge her by results. If she gives a cast-iron commitment to a national rebuilding programme that’s truly transformative in scale, and will help communities woefully neglected for decades, I will be delighted.Will that make it easier for more Labour MPs to vote for her Brexit deal? Yes.But that is not bribery, it’s politics. "},{"url":null,"title":"Whos biological daddy twins us","story":"    Alexandra and Calder Berney-Edwards are among the very few fraternal twins — that we know of, at least — with two different fathersAdorable 19-month-old twins Alexandra and Calder are the spitting image of Daddy — or make that both their daddies.Alexandra shares father Simon\u0027s big brown eyes, while Calder\u0027s piercing blue gaze makes him a doppelganger for his father, Graeme.\u0027Dada, Dada, Dada,\u0027 they chorus as they swap places on the laps of their devoted parents. It\u0027s their favourite word. And what about Mummy? Well, that\u0027s a bit more complicated.They have a \u0027tummy mummy\u0027, a Canadian surrogate called Meg Stone — a 32-year-old single mother of two sons aged 12 and six — who carried the IVF twins for the British same-sex married couple. Then there\u0027s the twins\u0027 biological mother, an anonymous American egg donor about whom the family knows almost nothing, apart from a detailed medical history.For sure, this will make for a very interesting bedtime story when the twins are old enough to understand. For Alexandra and Calder Berney-Edwards are among the very few fraternal twins — that we know of, at least — with two different fathers.Usually born to super-fertile mothers who have been intimate with more than one man while ovulating, these cases normally come to light only when paternity is questioned.But Simon and Graeme\u0027s one-of-each twins were very much planned — and at considerable cost — although they insist vanity played no part, nor a desire to pioneer a fashionable trend in the brave new world of assisted fertility.For while there is greater acceptance of families with same-sex parents these days, Simon and Graeme are painfully aware there are still some people who do not approve. Even a few gay acquaintances were, they say, \u0027dismissive\u0027.\u0027Sometimes people stare, and we can see them having little private conversations about us, but on the whole most people are very accepting,\u0027 says Simon. \u0027We\u0027ve always said we will be very upfront with the twins as they grow up, explaining their heritage in an appropriate way. There is so much ersity these days that having two dads is not quite as shocking any more.\u0027Certainly, the parental landscape has changed dramatically within a short space of time. When the couple first approached a clinic in Las Vegas three years ago, they imagined having only one child to begin with, possibly followed by a second a few years later — not unlike Sir Elton John and husband David Furnish\u0027s two young sons.But when the question arose of who would father their first child — cue much discussion and indecision — the clinic suggested a twin pregnancy: implanting two embryos fertilised separately by each of their sperm, a practice not permitted in the UK.The couple jumped at what sounded a logical and fair solution to their situation, and now, the two little ones are creating merry havoc in the kitchen-diner of their South-East London home, with toys and books spilling across the floor.\u0027We always said we didn\u0027t want to know whose child was whose because it really didn\u0027t matter to us,\u0027 says Simon, 43.  \u0027But almost as soon as they were born it was pretty evident just by looking at them!\u0027With IVF fees standing at £25,000 — and that\u0027s without international flights, accommodation, surrogate expenses and lawyers\u0027 fees — the couple also realised two separate pregnancies would be financially crippling. So they went for the double whammy.Even then, they had to remortgage their home, but they achieved their dream: the twins were born naturally in Canada on June 25, 2017, with both fathers — bursting with excitement — in attendance.Alexandra was born first, at 6 lb 10 oz, and the couple had no idea which of them was the biological father. But when Calder followed seven minutes later, weighing 7 lb 3 oz, there was no question of \u0027Who\u0027s the daddy?\u0027 He was the spit of Graeme as a baby.Red Ken Livingstone blames the US for the crisis in...Screen limits for children: Government lays out its first...Share this article\u0027Holding them for the first time was just unbelievable, and I still feel emotional thinking about it,\u0027 says misty-eyed business development manager Simon, as he cuddles daughter Alexandra, who showers him with kisses.\u0027Picking up these two little beings and looking into their eyes was just so overwhelming.\u0027Former landscape gardener Graeme, 48, who writes a blog about being a gay stay-at-home dad, adds: \u0027There was just this huge wave of love. It was absolutely amazing. Every day, I feel blessed to have these two.\u0027But do they ever find themselves favouring their own biological child over the other? Simon shakes his head, insisting: \u0027I love them both equally and in different ways.\u0027Actually, at times I almost have a better relationship with Calder and Graeme has a better relationship with Alexandra, because it mirrors our relationship. \u0027Alexandra can sometimes really push my buttons because we\u0027re so alike, and Calder can push Graeme\u0027s.\u0027Certainly, the twins don\u0027t appear to have a favourite daddy. They are equally cuddly with both, swapping places in their arms without so much as a squabble.And, despite their obvious genetic heritage, they have their own unique personalities.Mischievous Calder goes by the nickname Cheeky Bear on account of the glint in his blue eyes and his determination to \u0027get into everything\u0027. He is also \u0027court jester\u0027 to Alexandra, or rather Little Princess Bear, whose steely, regal glare \u0027would stop a herd of stampeding elephants in its tracks\u0027.\u0027She will make people work hard for that smile, but it\u0027s worth it,\u0027 says Graeme. \u0027Her daddies can usually be found wrapped around her little finger.\u0027Simon and Graeme, who met online eight years ago, agree the twins\u0027 arrival has turned their life on its head, not that they have a single regret.Their smart terrace home, once a neat, orderly space, is now overrun with books, educational toys, clothes and two lively toddlers. The days when Simon and Graeme could afford two or three holidays a year, plus 30 or 40 trips to the theatre, are a distant memory, and a large whiteboard on the wall lists meals, naps and kiddy activities.\u0027I love our new life, but there are moments when it\u0027s pure pandemonium and you think: \u0027Please just stop!\u0027 But there\u0027s something very lovely about having two children chattering away in the back of the car,\u0027 says Simon.Graeme, who credits ten years working as airline cabin crew for his cool, calm head when dealing with small, demanding customers, adds: \u0027Our lives are unrecognisable, but I\u0027d do it all again in a heartbeat. \u0027I cannot believe my luck, either in meeting Simon or having these two. When I take the kids to Twins Club I actually feel quite broody and want more.\u0027With nine viable fertilised embryos still in storage, that\u0027s a possibility, but Simon protests: \u0027No! We\u0027ve got our hands full. Ask me again in a few years\u0027 time!\u0027When Simon and Graeme first came out as gay in their early 20s, attitudes were such that they never imagined they\u0027d have children.          Canadian surrogate Meg Stone — a 32-year-old single mother of two sons aged 12 and six —  carried the IVF twins for the British same-sex married coupleGraeme, who grew up in the Scottish town of Hamilton, always longed for his own family, especially after his mother died in 1995 aged 50, followed by his younger sister who — unable to cope with the loss — took her own life five years later, aged just 27. With no other children, his father, Eddie, 77, had resigned himself to never experiencing the joy of grandchildren.Likewise, Simon, who grew up in Sussex the eldest of four children, longed to be a parent but, over the years, had to content himself with being \u0027fun uncle\u0027 to his six nephews and nieces.\u0027We\u0027re just like any other couple who finds they\u0027re incredibly happy and then thinks, wouldn\u0027t it be nice to have children?\u0027 says Graeme.Initially, they wanted to adopt, but their application ended in disappointment when they were told they didn\u0027t meet the agency\u0027s criteria. So they started to research surrogacy and, finding UK laws too restrictive, sought help from an international agency — founded by a gay father to three IVF children — which directed them to the fertility clinic in Las Vegas.\u0027There are some clinics where you can choose eggs from Ivy League geniuses, but that wasn\u0027t important to us,\u0027 says Simon. The pair chose their donor from a book of anonymous women.\u0027The way our donor wrote about her motivation just spoke to us. She said she wasn\u0027t ready to have children, but wanted to help others and use the money to put herself through college.\u0027Twenty eggs were harvested from the donor — half of which were fertilised with Simon\u0027s sperm and half with Graeme\u0027s, after they went through health and genetic tests — and then frozen.Shortly afterwards, they made contact with Meg Stone, a retail night manager from Ontario. \u0027I saw Simon and Graeme\u0027s profile and I thought they had lovely smiles,\u0027 she says. \u0027I love being pregnant and always wanted a big family, so when my marriage ended I decided to use that \u0027baby fever\u0027 to help someone else.\u0027Simon says: \u0027Meg is a special lady and we were drawn to her because she has this warmth. She said to us: I have one stipulation, that I want to have an ongoing relationship with the children. I\u0027d like to be the crazy aunt in Canada.\u0027That\u0027s what we wanted as well. When we met for the first time, it was as if we\u0027d known her all our lives.\u0027In October 2016, Simon and Graeme watched via Skype the \u0027mind-blowing\u0027 moment their two embryos were implanted into Meg\u0027s womb. They didn\u0027t choose the sex of the twins and didn\u0027t know if they would get two boys, two girls, one of each, just one, or none at all. There was even a risk the implanted eggs could split to produce triplets, or two sets of identical twins.Ten days on, they were ecstatic when Meg sent them a picture of a positive pregnancy test, later confirmed by a blood test. The first scan, at seven weeks, was nerve-racking, and Simon and Graeme watched via an internet link.\u0027The moment the person said: \u0027OK, there\u0027s one embryo and there\u0027s the other,\u0027 we were so excited and shocked,\u0027 says Simon.\u0027For an hour-and-a-half, we were pretty much incapable of moving. We were crying, ecstatically happy and also thinking: Oh my word, what have we done?\u0027Simon and Graeme waited until after the 12-week scan to break the news to their families — all of whom were thrilled. They refused tests to check the twins for Down\u0027s syndrome and other disabilities.\u0027We didn\u0027t want to know because they were our children, and we\u0027d accept and love them no matter what,\u0027 says Simon. Both flew out to Canada for the 19-week scan.Compared with carrying her own children, Meg found the pregnancy much more draining physically, suffering sickness, heartburn and swelling. Simon admits that, at times, the couple felt quite guilty at what she was going through to help them become parents.When Meg had a scare at 31 weeks, fearing she was going to deliver prematurely, Simon and Graeme jumped on a plane and went straight to the hospital — not knowing if they\u0027d be daddies by the time they arrived.Doctors managed to halt the labour, but Simon and Graeme decided to stay in Canada and were on tenterhooks for six weeks. There were several more false alarms before the twins were induced at 37 weeks.\u0027We thought labour would take hours, but it happened so quickly,\u0027 says Simon. \u0027One minute I nipped off to the loo and the next they were delivering the first of our children.\u0027It was pure coincidence Simon was at the \u0027business\u0027 end when Alexandra was born, so he was the first to hold his biological child and cut the cord, while Graeme did the honours with Calder.\u0027Right up until the moment of birth, I was thinking: \u0027Am I ready to be a father?\u0027 But the moment I held the twins in my arms, I knew that I was,\u0027 says Graeme. \u0027It was everything I\u0027d ever dreamed of.\u0027Simon adds: \u0027It was so lovely in the recovery room, on our own with our children. I called my mum and when I held the camera out I could hear her screaming: Babies, you\u0027ve got Babies! Then calling to Dad: Dan! Dan! They\u0027ve got babies.They named Alexandra after Simon\u0027s grandmother and Calder after the maiden name of Graeme\u0027s grandmother. The family stayed in Canada for another seven weeks while legal paperwork was sorted.DNA tests, required before the fathers could apply for a parental order in the UK, confirmed what they already knew.Since then, life has been a happy, if exhausting, whirlwind of sleepless nights, nappy-changing, play-dates, and weekly trips to the local Twins Club. On the twins\u0027 first birthday, surrogate Meg travelled from Canada to celebrate with them. They keep her up-to-date via Facebook and regular phone calls.Meg, now pregnant with surrogate twins for another couple, says: \u0027I would carry another baby for them in a heartbeat to give the twins siblings. I hope to be in their lives as long as they want me.\u0027One thing is for certain about this very modern family: it may not be conventional, but the love is unconditional. Says Simon: \u0027What the twins will certainly know is that they were both 100 per cent wanted and are 100 per cent loved.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1b3b54800596582aa87adc23724adcfe356f329/0_211_4055_2432/master/4055.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aae260a10bbb78b45c2b63b17a1e8b6","title":"jd salingers unseen writings to be published family confirms","story":"Exclusive: The Catcher in the Rye author’s son tells the  estate will publish ‘all of what he wrote’ over next decadeJD Salinger’s son has confirmed for the first time that the late author of The Catcher in the Rye wrote a significant amount of work that has never been seen, and that he and his father’s widow are “going as fast as we freaking can” to get it ready for publication.Salinger died in 2010, leaving behind a small but perfectly formed body of published work that has not been added to since 1965’s New Yorker story, Hapworth 16, 1924. Rumours have circulated for years that the creator of one of the 20th century’s most enduring characters, Holden Caulfield, continued to write over the ensuing decades he spent in the New Hampshire village of Cornish, far from public view.In an exclusive interview with the , his son Matt Salinger has finally revealed, definitively, that his father never stopped writing and that “all of what he wrote will at some point be shared”.Matt Salinger said his father “teemed with ideas and thoughts … he’d be driving the car and he’d pull over to write something and laugh to himself – sometimes he’d read it to me, sometimes he wouldn’t – and next to every chair he had a notebook.“He just decided that the best thing for his writing was not to have a lot of interactions with people, literary types in particular,” he said. “He didn’t want to be playing in those poker games, he wanted to, as he would encourage every would-be writer to do, you know, stew in your own juices.”Matt Salinger, an actor and producer, squashed reports that emerged in 2013 of five new books by his father, including one short story featuring Holden Caulfield and one based on Salinger’s brief marriage to Sylvia, a Nazi collaborator. The reports stemmed from a documentary about the author, to which his closest family did not formally contribute Matt described the rumours as “total trash” that “have little to no bearing on reality … anyone that understood my father at all would find the idea hysterically funny that he would write a book about his first brief marriage. It’s so far beyond the realm of plausibility.”He did not reveal specifics about the stories, although it appears likely there will be more about the Glass family, who frequently appear in Salinger’s published short fiction. He described his father’s later work as having “no linear evolution”, saying that “it becomes clear that he was after different game”.He and Salinger’s widow, Colleen O’Neill, with whom he has joint charge of the literary estate, have been working with the material since 2011. He said it was not ready for publication yet.“He wanted me to pull it together, and because of the scope of the job, he knew it would take a long time. This was somebody who was writing for 50 years without publishing, so that’s a lot of material. So there’s not a reluctance or a protectiveness: when it’s ready, we’re going to share it,” he said. This will take years, he admitted, though he hopes less than a decade: “I don’t owe an apology, I don’t think, but your readers should know that we’re going as fast as we freaking can … I feel the pressure to get this done, more than he did.”The unseen writing, Matt Salinger said, “will definitely disappoint people that he wouldn’t care about, but for real readers … I think it will be tremendously well received by those people and they will be affected in the way every reader hopes to be affected when they open a book. Not changed, necessarily, but something rubs off that can lead to change.”“When my father said that everything he has to say is in his fiction, believe it – it’s there. I think when more of his writing is made accessible, he covers everything that the discerning reader would care about. My job is to help that happen as soon as it can, and stay out of the way,” he said.He has also worked against the republication of several early stories by his father – stories that Salinger himself had said it would be “unfair” to publish. “Suppose you had a coat you liked and somebody went into your closet and stole it. That’s how I feel,” the author told the New York Times in 1974, following the publication of two volumes of his uncollected works. Matt Salinger described them as “youthful exercises, part of his process, his development as an artist”.“I don’t do it lightly, it’s no fun,” he said of blocking publication. “I do it because my father would have done it and out of love for him, and out of love and protectiveness for his work and his books.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48693da7289b87c5bd0dee7119d3a63549f640f5/0_189_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96b178e196f2dcf941ce9d8dbfed87cc","title":"matt salinger jd the catcher in the rye","story":"In JD Salinger’s centenary year, his son and literary executor opens up about life with the Catcher in the Rye author – and for the first time, confirms there are unpublished works to comeAmong all the dispute and conjecture that has surrounded the life of JD Salinger, one mystery remains especially puzzling. What did he produce after ceasing to publish his writing in 1965, and will it ever be read? It seemed possible that more work would come to light after Salinger’s death in 2010. In 2013 a documentary and accompanying book claimed, among other things, to describe the contents of five new Salinger books that would be forthcoming by 2020 at the latest, yet here we are at his centenary and there has been no sign.I ask Salinger’s son Matt about the rumours of new material when we meet for breakfast near his home in Connecticut, and he doesn’t mince words. “They’re total trash,” he says. “The specific bullet-point dramatic quote-unquote reveals that have been made are utter bullshit. They have little to no bearing on reality.” He has been reluctant, until now, to talk about his father at all. “I’ve gotten away with not having this kind of conversation for 58 years,” he says. Still, he is ready, now, to confirm that other writing does exist. His father “teemed with ideas and thoughts, and he’d be driving the car and he’d pull over to write something and laugh to himself – sometimes he’d read it to me, sometimes he wouldn’t – and next to every chair he had a notebook.” He assures me that “most all of what he wrote will at some point be shared with the people that love reading his stuff”. When I ask why that moment hasn’t yet arrived, he is disarmingly direct. “It’s not ready. He wanted me to pull it together, and because of the scope of the job, he knew it would take a long time. This was somebody who was writing for 50 years without publishing, so that’s a lot of material. So there’s not a reluctance or a protectiveness: when it’s ready, we’re going to share it.”Tall and striking, with an air of warmth and amusement that belies his evident doubts about talking to me at all, Matt Salinger is an actor – probably best known for playing Captain America in the 1990 film – and a producer of movies and theatre, most notably Pamela Gien’s The Syringa Tree, which he “put my whole self into for a decade”, producing an international hit. What becomes clear is that he has been immersed in his father’s material for years – pages typed on Underwood and Royal typewriters, as well as what Salinger called “his squibs, or his fragments” on ordinary paper cut into eighths: “a lot of handwritten, very small notes”. When he began work in 2011, Matt never expected it would take eight years. He feels “fortunate”, he says. “Reading this stuff for the first time” has been “an emotional thing”, like having an ongoing dialogue with his father. “A lot of my friends at this age, their parents are dying or have died and they’re just gone, you know. And my father’s not gone. He hasn’t died for me.” Often he will “just have to stop what I am doing”, struck by something “that I recognise that for the right reader, whether it’s millions or hundreds of thousands or tens of thousands or three or one, it could just be the one right reader that needs to read that. I feel the pressure to get this done, more than he did.”When I ask how much longer it will take, Matt replies: “We’re definitely talking years,” though, he hopes, fewer than 10. “When his widow and I were first gauging what needed to be done after he died, I knew that I wouldn’t be producing any films or theatre for a while and I knew that I would only be doing enough acting to keep my family’s health insurance.” Often people will approach Matt in public, at a ski resort or bike repair shop – “it’s always my credit card that does me in!” – with “a cri de coeur”, pleading to know if or when more work will appear. One older woman said she didn’t want to die without having read what more there is. “If that’s not pressure …” he says. “I don’t take any of this lightly.” He adds, “I don’t owe an apology, I don’t think, but your readers should know that we’re going as fast as we freaking can.”Of the rumours that have spread, Matt laughs that “anyone that understood my father at all would find the idea hysterically funny that he would write a book about his first brief marriage. It’s so far beyond the realm of plausibility.” He’s unwilling, at this point, to reveal anything specific, though it’s clear that there will be more about the Glass family, who inhabit many of his best published stories. He says there’s “no linear evolution” in the later work: “It becomes clear that he was after different game.” Matt believes the new work “will definitely disappoint people that he wouldn’t care about, but for real readers … I think it will be tremendously well received by those people and they will be affected in the way every reader hopes to be affected when they open a book. Not changed, necessarily, but something rubs off that can lead to change.”Matt was born in 1960 and immortalised a year later in the dedication to Franny and Zooey (Salinger writes that he offered the book up to the New Yorker’s editor, William Shawn, “as nearly as possible in the spirit of Matthew Salinger, age one, urging a luncheon companion to accept a cool lima bean”). By the time Matt came along, the second child of his father’s second marriage, in 1955, to Claire Douglas, Salinger had already published most of the work on which his monumental reputation rests. After the perennial bestseller The Catcher in the Rye (1951) came For Esmé – with Love and Squalor, Franny and Zooey, Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters (the last three mostly consist of stories that appeared in the New Yorker from the late 1940s to 1950s), and then that final New Yorker story, “Hapworth 16, 1924,” in June 1965.As a child, Matt didn’t hear much about his father’s work. “We were more likely to talk about the Dartmouth football team, or what are we going to do when I pick you up on Wednesday.” He speaks of the respect his father had for children: “He did see the world as something that will just work on fucking you up, if allowed to. He had a real belief and even reverence for the innate intelligence and beauty of kids before they’re homogenised.” Matt’s sister, Margaret, who is four years older than him, offered in her 2000 memoir Dream Catcher a much darker portrait of their parents and childhood, which Matt refuted in print as “gothic tales”. (These days he keeps her informed about plans for the centenary and says: “I only wish her happiness.”) JD Salinger’s first marriage, to a German woman just after the second world war, lasted less than a year. After his orce from Matt and Margaret’s mother in the 1960s, he eventually married Colleen O’Neill, who now has joint charge of his literary trust with Matt.That means being on the first line of defence, “fighting lawsuits and tilting at windmills”, fending off what Salinger called “wanters” (I can’t quite tell if the “relentless” Harvey Weinstein, who was “after me forever” to get a film of Catcher off the ground, counts as one of these), and hindering, for instance, the republication of several early stories that Salinger did not want collected. (His father’s feeling about those stories, which were “youthful exercises, part of his process, his development as an artist,” seemed to Matt to be akin to “when you’re having a bad night and you’re trying to go to sleep and you think of things and you just have that wince, ‘Did I really say that?’ or ‘Did I really do that?’ …. There was also more ego in those, he called himself a showoff when he was young.”) Matt has been “keeping up that vigilance. And it’s not a sporting exercise, I don’t do it lightly, it’s no fun. I do it because my father would have done it and out of love for him, and out of love and protectiveness for his work and his books.” He has made himself an expert in international copyright law, and speaks with energy about “European countries where their law came more from Hegel than from Locke.” In the cottage industry of Salinger quasi-biography, he identifies a “weird sort of inverse relationship,” in which “the better somebody knew my father, the less likely they were going to be to talk to anybody. And there was really no middle ground, you either knew him really well and intimately or you just knew him completely casually.” He himself is painstakingly precise in what he says about his father or the work, often second-guessing a word or phrase, reiterating that his father would probably hate what he’s saying and how he’s saying it, or deciding, mid-way through a seemingly harmless sentence, not to finish it. All Salinger’s files, which in his lifetime were kept in a pair of safes in his house – “and thank God they were”, Matt remembers, because otherwise everything would have been lost when Salinger’s house burned down during the 1990s – are now in a high-security storage facility.Salinger’s desire for privacy, of course, only increased the feverish interest of the press, and his son kept track of the shift in words habitually used to describe him as the decades passed, “seeing when the word recluse started being used. And then that morphed in the common vernacular among journalists to ‘famous recluse’, and then it became ‘infamous recluse’. In the last 10 years, it became ‘notorious recluse’, and if you really think about that word, it’s damning, it has all kinds of psychological overtones, and it’s dishonest, and like so much that’s written, it says more about the person who’s writing it than it does about the subject.” There was nothing sinister or mysterious, Matt insists, in his father’s wish to live and write in private. “He just decided that the best thing for his writing was not to have a lot of interactions with people, literary types in particular. He didn’t want to be playing in those poker games, he wanted to, as he would encourage every would-be writer to do, you know, stew in your own juices.” Salinger gives a vivid, impromptu impression of his father, on the phone, clearing his throat: “Sorry Matt, God, I haven’t used my voice in three days.” Time alone was simply “what he needed for his work, and his work was everything to him”. The rest, Matt says, “is just noise and mythologising and pathologising and people’s own neurosis”.At one point he shows me a copy of one of the small, handwritten notes that he came across recently, as “an offering or a gesture” to Salinger’s readers. “Anyone that loved his writing and thinks they cared for him in a certain way might have been alarmed or concerned at so much of what’s been written,” he thinks, and he wants them to get “a glimpse” at how Salinger was feeling late in life. The piece, “like a haiku in a way”, describes a moment of unexpected and “still, not disquieting” happiness while resting, having been up working at the typewriter since six that morning: “and, through the window by the bed he saw that snow was falling without rush but copiously into the grayness, the December unsunniness of the late afternoon, and it was suddenly, bliss, sheer bliss, to be alive and watching and about to fall asleep, nearing sleep. Bliss. Thank you, God!”He is currently deciding what should be included in an exhibition at the New York Public Library in October – “talk about things that go against my nature!” – that will have some manuscripts, photographs, objects, letters. But, he promises: “We’re never going to be merchandising anything. There’s never going to be a Salinger vodka.” Going through some of the hundred or so letters his father wrote him, “often funny as hell”, dating from the early 1970s to 2009, he offers to read some to me. A letter from 1976 links an interpretation of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar with the TV journalist Dan Rather’s soppy coverage of Nixon’s resignation and with a tennis match between Chris Evert and Evonne Goolagong, whom he sees as “like some Star Trek girl from outer space ... Too peace-loving, too placid to be effective against any of the hustlers from Earth.” He writes:“There’s probably no limit to the extremes of infantile and Zoo-like behavior adults will take to, or revert to, if they’re in a group (which means any number of people in excess of two – and on some occasions two’s a mob, especially if there’s booze around), and if the organised shit-throwing is given the permissive, O.K. general heading of Fun \u0026amp Games, or if it’s vaguely categorized as Letting Off a Little Steam Once in a While Never Hurt Anybody, Mac. Oh, groups at large give me the willies, Da. Group enthusiasm, of any kind, either for cheering or lynching, makes me very uneasy …”Elsewhere he expresses delight in catching one of Matt’s appearances on TV (he praised his honesty and brilliance, “right in the middle of all that SHIT!!”). Other letters are very emotionally direct. Going through “all those old papers and letters yesterday made me all the more aware how happy and relieved I am to be living in the present, not the past. I can’t say I cared much for the War or military school or my childhood. These Cornish years with you and Peggy and this house and you and the fields and my notebooks and work and you and Lili and Schotland and Nice Doggie and Rosie and you and Sri. R. and the Nuremberg Egg and our trips to London and Lake Placid and Dublin and Montreal and Andover – these years have been what I would call my real life.”The preparation of his father’s writing is, Matt feels, the most meaningful work he could be doing. “You’re only given one life. Most of the movies that I produced were crap.” He also assures readers that “when my father said that everything he has to say is in his fiction, believe it – it’s there. I think when more of his writing is made accessible, he covers everything that the discerning reader would care about. My job is to help that happen as soon as it can, and stay out of the way.” He adds: “Whatever I have to offer up on his behalf, I’ll certainly do with more belief and faith and love than I offered that lima bean to whoever it was. And hope.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20031fcd7f24c9f5d5794e7b239d1d5907b56e75/0_42_715_429/master/715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aae92a426d111d4497d44473f470b5f","title":"young adult author cancels own novel after race controversy","story":"Advance copies of Amélie Wen Zhao’s Blood Heir were criticised for its depiction of slavery, for which the author apologised and pulled publicationAn up-and-coming young adult author has cancelled the publication of her highly anticipated debut novel, following a flood of online criticism from readers over her depiction of race and slavery.Amélie Wen Zhao’s novel, Blood Heir, was sold to publishers for a high six-figure sum last January. A fantastical retelling of the Anastasia story involving “a princess hiding a dark secret and the conman she must trust to clear her name for her father’s murder”, it was scheduled to be published in June.But in a statement on Wednesday, Zhao said that negative feedback from the young adult community had led to her asking her publisher, Delacorte Press, not to release the book “at this time”.Following positive early reviews, a groundswell of criticism of Blood Heir began last month, with reviews posted on Goodreads and Twitter calling out what one reader described as “the anti-blackness and blatant bigotry in this book”, particularly its depiction of slavery and the death of a particular black character.In comparison with other publishing controversies attracting ire online, such as Keira Drake’s YA novel The Continent, which was slammed for its “white saviour” narrative, and picture book A Birthday Cake for George Washington, which was withdrawn after its upbeat portrayal of slavery was questioned, criticism of Zhao’s novel was relatively confined, possibly because the author responded so fast in cancelling her book release.“It was never my intention to bring harm to any reader of this valued community, particularly those for whom I seek to write and empower … I don’t wish to clarify, defend or have anyone defend me. This is not that this is an apology,” wrote Zhao on 30 January, adding that she was “grateful to those who have raised questions around representation, coding, and themes in my book”.Zhao, who raised in Beijing and emigrated from China to the US at the age of 18, said she wrote the book “from my immediate cultural perspective”, writing that the slavery storylines in her novel “represent a specific critique of the epidemic of indentured labor and human trafficking prevalent in many industries across Asia, including in my own home country”.“The narrative and history of slavery in the US is not something I can, would, or intended to write, but I recognise that I am not writing in merely my own cultural context,” she wrote.Zhao had previously said on her website that she had set out to create “a erse cast, many of which are beloved and dear to a third-culture kid like myself … a tawny-skinned minority of a Russian-esque princess a disowned and dishonoured Asian-esque assassin an islanderCaribbean-esque child warrior a Middle-Eastern-esque soldier”.“I write fantasy, but my story draws inspiration from themes I see in the real world today. As a foreigner in Trump’s America, I’ve been called names and faced unpleasant remarks – and as a non-citizen, I’ve felt like I have no voice – which is why I’ve channeled my anger, my frustration, and my need for action into the most powerful weapon I have: my words,” she wrote last year.While some on social media praised her decision to cancel publication, others urged her to reconsider bowing to “bullying” from a “mob”.

It’s hard to argue with her. Once at the heart of the steel city, the shopping road is now pocked with vacant shops. Soon H\u0026ampM will follow Next in relocating to the Moor, a recently redeveloped part of town.For residents like Shaw, 70, the deserted feeling is enough to give up shopping here altogether. “The only reason I bother to come into Sheffield now is to go to the bank because they’ve closed so many outside of town,” she says.Worst affected were clothing stores, specialist shops and restaurants. Some stores are doing better – there has been an increase in cafes, tattoo shops and hair and beauty salons, for example – but in Sheffield you can see the net effect. Fargate has lost an electronics store, a plus-size clothing retailers, a video games store and countless eateries.On nearby Devonshire Street, home to a warren of independent shops and an increasing number of places to get a new trim, ink or a soy latte, the busiest haunt on a January weekday is the 200 Degrees cafe.The blame for Sheffield’s retail decline has long been placed on Meadowhall. Since it opened in 1990, the huge shopping complex three miles (5km) outside the city centre has offered more shopping options under one roof, with free parking. Adding to the competition, last July a new £35m retail park boasting high street behemoths such as Wilko, Next and TK Maxx arrived in the suburb of Meadowhead.But that doesn’t explain why the city centre has been so badly gutted in the last five years, leading others to point the finger at online shopping. In November 2018, for the first time in the UK, more than £1 of every £5 of shopping was spent online.Sheffield shopkeepers, however, are unconvinced. “About half of our clients now come off the internet,” said AJ Rundell, 20, manager of Follow Your Dreams tattoo studio on Devonshire Street. “It’s a way to show people what we do.”Instead, many local shop owners blame high business rates.“We’re paying higher and higher business rates, but I can’t really see how we’re benefitting from it,” said one business owner in the Devonshire Quarter, who points out that shop closures – like that of bookstore Rare and Racy which shuttered to make way for yet another development – means fewer people visit their end of the street. The rates are calculated according to the value of a property on the open market – and the huge increase in property values has seen it skyrocket.Earlier this week, business chiefs called for a dramatic overhaul of business rates to help bolster Britain’s high streets. Bill Grimsey, the former Wickes and Iceland chief executive who has conducted two reviews of the UK high street, urged a sales tax to replace business rates, in order to reflect the shifting way consumers buy products, but the government has shown no indication it will make changes any time soon.Sheffield council, which has no authority over business rates, is trying to use the powers it does have: over the next five years it will plough millions into the city in a bid to compete with Leeds and Manchester as a shopping destination. A huge new 1.5m sq ft triangle of development, housing new shops, luxury hotels, offices, apartments and leisure venues, is planned for the centre.The idea is not a new one – the 2008 financial crash scuppered the original plans – but most struggling shop owners don’t think it will help them. For one thing, the construction sites on Pinstone Street are hurting smaller businesses.“All the building works made it really hard to work as a business,” says Abi Golland, a branch of whose burrito joint The Street Food Chef, which was under a compulsory purchase order, closed last August.Sheffield City Council’s cabinet member for business and investment, Mazher Iqbal, said he understands the struggles of high street shops, but emphasises that the council doesn’t set business rates, and that although “most of the shops have closed down due to the redevelopment” on Pinstone Street, the council have been inundated with queries from investors into the new developments.On Chapel Walk, once a hive of specialist locally owned stores, scaffolding at its narrow entrance just off Fargate hides it from those unfamiliar with the area. Lucille Cox, manager at Andaa Home kitchen supplies shop, says: “People who visited us before know us so they come to us, but others tend not to come down this side of the road any more.”Nor is everyone in the city enthused by the prospect of attracting yet more retail conglomerates. Sheffield Hallam students Ellie Goodman, 18, and Tassie Drobinski, 20, scoffed at the idea of shopping at the huge new Primark or Gap.“We mainly go to the vintage shops up the road, like Cow,” said Drobinski.One independent retailer, who didn’t want to be named because he has been “too vocal” in his criticism of the council in the past and needs its support, believes the city authority’s focus is short-sighted. Characterful, varied stores are what boosts a city’s reputation, he argues.“Other cities have always thought ahead. But to our council, big companies have always been more important,” he said.“How do they expect to attract these high-end retailers to flock in if there’s nothing unique about the place?”This article was amended on 1 February 2019 to clarify that H\u0026ampM and Next were relocating to the Moor development.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32b88a8de134978efaafa7efe72294c05131190e/0_304_5786_3471/master/5786.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a935098c38ae238ccf2d7fdf67c719d2","title":"we dont notice the smell any more valparaiso by natasha cross an urban cartoon","story":"Valparaiso, Chile, is famous for its riot of street art, but spare a thought for the binmen working in this extremely hilly city ...Natasha Cross is an artist who has been living and painting murals in Valparaiso as part of a creative journey across South America.

But everyone should salute Ukip leader Gerard Batten for totally revitalising the genre this week by calling the Queen a traitor. Gerard, a sort of radicalised Just For Men box, wrote to Her Majesty to ask her to prorogue parliament to save Brexit. He also took the opportunity to inform Queen Elizabeth II that she had committed treason when she signed the Maastricht treaty.“To presume to convey rights on or to impose duties on Your Majesty was, and remains, unlawful and treasonous under the bill of rights and the coronation oath,” wrote the Ukip leader, whose treatment for low-budget legal drama Better Call Gerard is thought not to have tempted the networks. “Your Majesty’s ministers were gravely in error and wrongly advised you.”Don’t try to follow this reasoning just let it coat you like three really hard sprays of Brut Musk. I think it’s fair to say that it wasn’t drafted for Gerard by his new spad, Tommy Robinson, given it relies on legal expertise outside the area of mortgage fraud. But even with help from a lawyer, it still reads like the sort of letter Raoul Moat might have written in the storm drain.Then again, this level of up-against-it madness is increasingly widespread. Did you watch Tuesday’s Brexit amendments shitshow live from parliament? The vast majority didn’t, yet MPs do seem to think their ratings are somewhere north of Bodyguard’s. These days, they are forever standing up to inquire rhetorically how they might look “to those watching at home”.Outside on Westminster’s College Green, a tented media village-cum-field hospital provides pundits with 24-hour opportunities to be sassily wrong. Looked at in the round, Brexit is easily the most expensive show on television, watched only by people who detest it. For that money, I really expect CGI dragons, sentient sex robots or the ever-present possibility that Jeremy Clarkson might implode in a high-velocity fireball. Instead, Wednesday offered the trade secretary, Liam Fox, in an anorak, explaining that how parliament acts now is important “for future referendums”. FUTURE REFERENDUMS? I mean, no one more than me is looking forward to the Tokyo Drift version of this franchise, but I wonder if in some ways we’d just be chasing this first high.And so to the performance of our entire political class. The UK is now the only argument on Earth in favour of rising sea levels. If our economy does go tits-up after Brexit, we could recoup some money in the form of sponsorship by Exxon or the plastics industry. We could become the first country to be propped up by petrochemicals lobbyists as an argument for everyone using MORE of their product. Accelerate freely to put Britain out of its misery.Speaking of Mother Earth, meanwhile, it does feel time to accept that, like Los Angeles, the Conservative party is built on a faultline. LA has San Andreas the Tories have Europe. (Calculating 20 years ago that LA had been destroyed 138 times in novels and films, the writer Mike Davis described it as “a Book of the Apocalypse theme park” – a description I would also apply to the annual Conservative party conference.) Over the past few decades, extraordinary amounts of energy and ingenuity have been expended to keep the Tory party together, despite these seismically challenged foundations. Quite how long the fragile ecology can hold before the big one hits is unclear.But if you had to condense the past couple of years into a movie trailer, you’d surely get something that starts out suggesting a romantic comedy, before the voiceover kicks into a much pacier and more urgent register, and swiftly descends into the demented disaster movie genre. “How far would YOU go to keep the Conservative party from splitting?” it would begin breezily. “Would you offer people a choice one crazy summer? Would you call half your country citizens of nowhere? Would you deport people with British children who have lived here for 24 years? Would you start saying things like, ‘there will be adequate food’?“Would you declare it was worth running the car industry down because ‘these things happen’? Would you demand Ireland leave the EU because you’ve shat the bed? Would you watch people be warned of essential medicine shortages? Would you tell schools that they’ll have to be flexible over food standards? Would you refuse to rule out deaths from drug shortages? Would you write some insane column wanking over rationing cookbooks for a war you were born after? Would you stockpile trauma packs out of concerns over risk to life? Would you –”STOP. Christ… what are we even watching? Is The Rock in this one? He’d better be, because any minute now the freeway’s going to collapse and the only way out is him slinging us over his shoulder and physically carrying us to safety. We have reached the stage in our national journey where we must rely on the kindness of strangers in torn tank tops.Theresa May, meanwhile, has reached the stage in her journey of realising she needs Labour. I liked that she and Jeremy Corbyn prefaced their talks on Wednesday by trading leaden insults during prime minister’s questions, allowing us to manage our expectations and realise the meeting itself would be an acting-regional-manager version of the Reichenbach Falls. It’s an encouraging prospect: talks between Siri’s 2009 beta version and a man whose USP is not having changed his mind since the mid Mesolithic era. There were no flies on the wall, unfortunately, as they all took the decision to plough suicidally into the lightbulbs.It’s hard not to be inspired by a Labour leader whose Brexit approach is “How much will I, personally, be blamed for this?” Pretty sure everyone is now clear that Brexit belongs to the Tories, but Corbyn’s level of uninterest in the results of that does arguably tarnish the halo. Perhaps the 30-year papers will reveal May used their pow-wow to quote Mean Girls at him. “God, at least me and Regina George know we’re mean! You try to act like you’re so innocent!”As when they found the billion pounds for the DUP, the government hasn’t got money for fripperies such as alleviating rampant homelessness, but they’ve always got a little something squirrelled away when it matters. Or as Labour members being offered investment in their constituencies might put it: don’t piss on my back and tell me it’s a rainy day. Until now, the government has preferred to operate on that old proverb: give a man a food bank, and you feed him for a day. Force him to build his own food banks, and you feed resentment for a lifetime. May’s appealing new tactic is to buy off Labour by promising money for former coalmining areas. No rush, no rush.No rush on any of it, really. Parliament is allowing prearranged half-term holidays to go ahead, which is good news for ski-booked MPs who regard Europe as something you might slide down on the way to a long lunch. Any senior Brexiteers remaining can continue their practice of telling TV cameras that they expect the EU to cave at the last minute. Keep saying your plan out loud, brainiacs – what’s the worst that could happen?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21f471129f793d70890766129e3e1f6e5f87fb32/0_495_3061_1837/master/3061.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe133210f1dcf96c956fa26f37050895","title":"david bowie girl mousy hair muse","story":"Artists’ muses rarely get a chance to speak out. If only it happened more oftenHow lovely to hear from Hermione Farthingale, the girl with the mousy hair and muse of David Bowie for his 1971 song Life on Mars. Finally we’ll be able to get closure on those questions that have baffled us for the best part of half a century. Why was her mother yelling no? Why did her father tell her to go? And why didn’t she consider some sort of colouring product to brighten up her hair?In fact, none of these questions is satisfactorily answered in the interview Farthingale gives for the forthcoming BBC film David Bowie: Finding Fame. We learn, though, that after they fell in love in 1968 (“He looked ridiculously young, he looked about eight”) they formed a band called Feathers. The following year the dancer and actor ditched him to make a film called Song of Norway.We learn that Farthingale later married an anthropologist and moved to Papua New Guinea that now she teaches yoga and pilates in Bristol. And, oh yes, we learn that she broke Bowie’s heart. “I didn’t get over that for such a long time,” he says in the film. “It really broke me up.” His song Letter to Hermione includes these lines: “I tear my soul to cease the pain, I think maybe you feel the same, what can we do?” He was carrying a torch for Farthingale as late as 2013. In the video for his single Where Are We Now? you can see he’s wearing a Song of Norway T-shirt. Farthingale still remembers him fondly too, telling interviewers: “We were soulmates.”How rarely we hear from artists’ muses, especially if they’re women. There is no reply to Bob Dylan’s portrait of an unravelling marriage, Blood on the Tracks. In another world, Sara Lownds would have replied to Dylan’s “We’re idiots babeIt’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves” with her own song entitled Speak for Yourself, Laughing Boy. Will we ever hear from the former schoolgirls who inspired the Boomtown Rats’ Mary of the 4th Form, or the Police’s no less sexually charged Don’t Stand So Close To Me? Probably not.True, Amber Rose, muse of Kanye West’s album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, has made her feelings about her ex plain on Twitter. But often the muse is monologued into oblivion. The history of western art can be told as the story of women stripped naked for the male gaze, then in a double violation programmatically silenced. Muses are seen but not heard.Giving silenced women posthumous voice is the task of later artists. Pat Barker’s new novel The Silence of the Girls gives unprecedented voice to the abducted, raped and otherwise maltreated women of the Trojan wars. These include Helen of Troy, the woman whose beauty catalysed the unpleasantness and prompted its commemoration in song and story, making her a muse.When we do hear from women who have been on the receiving end of male art, their version can be eviscerating. Loudon Wainwright III’s mea culpa of a song, Hitting You, includes this verse: “Long ago I hit you, we were in the carYou were crazy in the back seat, it had gone too farAnd I pulled the auto over, hit you with all my mightI knew right away it was too hard and I’d never make it right.” Later, his daughter Martha retorted in song: “I will not pretendI will not put on a smileI will not say, I’m all right for you.” She was sick of him using her and his family as material. Not that men are immune to cultural erasure. I’d like to hear from the subject of Sylvia Plath’s rant of a poem Daddy, with verses including: “Every woman adores a FascistThe boot in the face, the bruteBrute heart of a brute like you.” Daddy’s sonnet cycle – maybe entitled, I’m a Nice Man, Actually – would be worth a look. There’s a scene in Proust’s In Search of Lost Time that gets to the heart of the problematic artist-muse relationship. The narrator lies beside his sleeping lover, Albertine, and masturbates against her. “It seemed to me at those moments,” wrote Proust, “that I possessed her more completely, like an unconscious part of dumb nature.” The writer and academic Jacqueline Rose wrote a novel called Albertine, to free the woman from being made dumb and unconscious. Rose told me: “I thought, this is ridiculous – she’d have woken up by now! I had my feminist reaction, which is: just let the woman speak.”Quite right. Though there’s one problem: Proust’s muse may not have been a woman, but rather a mash-up of at least two unattainable men – namely his chauffeur, Alfred Agostinelli, and his secretary, Albert Nahmias. “If only I were able to change my sex,” Proust wrote to Nahmias in November 1911, “alter my age and the way I look, and take on the aspect of a young and beautiful woman so that I could embrace you with all my heart.” Instead, Proust sublimated his feelings by creating Albertine and possessing her in fiction. That’s the problem with muses. If they’re not dead, they’re composites or silenced. What a delight when they’re not. How lovely to hear from the girl with the mousy hair, who escaped from a song to become a woman in her own right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17dfa27d1b892e423e66d5f8ef516f81fa017707/0_0_6307_3785/master/6307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=546f0e469efbd8b09e71d32e8d9f9612","title":"nigeria presidential elections hope new candidates","story":"Who would want to be president of Nigeria? Well, once upon a time, me. When I was 19, I set out my manifesto on the BBC Africa website. Some of my campaign promises included quality education, constant electricity and running water for all. I planned to use my honest smile as my most efficient tool to win votes and secure the presidency.By 21 I’d set my sights a little lower. After some research, I discovered that local government was the most effective place to implement real change. So I decided that by 30 I was going to be a local government chair in Lagos, my home state. I would be in charge of primary education, waste management and primary healthcare for over a million people. Two years from my deadline, I am still ensconced in the suburbs of London with not a campaign flyer in sight.What happened to my grand plans? Well, like a good African immigrant, I got a first degree, then a second and a third, and now teach at a university. I also wrote two novels. Writing, in fact, is my real job but my family still think I do it on the side.It’s not that I forgot Nigeria. It’s just that the road to local government office seemed longer and more full of potholes every time I switched on the news.“Only corrupt people go into politics. Are you willing to carry bags of money for a politician?” a family member asked. I most certainly was not. I don’t have the upper arm strength.“Politics in Nigeria is not for women. It’s too rough and it’s bad for your skin,” an aunt cautioned me. I’d considered the roughness of politics in Nigeria. I’d already booked kickboxing classes after I watched videos of our legislators throwing punches at each other but I’d completely failed to account for the effect political ambitions might have on my epidermis.So I took up other less acne-inducing pursuits and let my dreams languish. That is until Nigeria’s February 2019 elections drew near and a new crop of candidates began to emerge.The first unlikely candidate to catch my attention was a man called Fela Durotoye. He was a well-known motivational speaker who had never held a government position in his life. He spoke passionately, as one would expect of a man of his profession. He was in his 40s and didn’t look likely to disappear to Europe for months of medical treatment. When asked about his lack of experience, Durotoye made the point that a broken system can’t be fixed by the people within.Others who emerged were Oby Ezekwesili, a former education minister, who champions the Bring Back Our Girls movement in Nigeria and Kingsley Moghalu, an economist and former director of the Central Bank of Nigeria.None of them had ever held elected office. They were not part of the brigade of recycled ex-dictators and career politicians who usually dominate the news when elections roll around in Nigeria. For the first time, the media was seriously engaging with candidates outside the two largest political parties, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC).“Do you think any of them can win?” I asked an older friend.It was a good point. While Durotoye may have more Instagram followers than President Buhari, would people outside urban centres like Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt even know who he was? The people who never went on Instagram and who’d never seen his hashtag #NewNigeria.Already, some of the new faces are dropping out of the race. Ezekwesili, who I believe will one day make a great president, has stepped down this time. There are rumours of a merger between Moghalu and Durotoye’s political parties, which means that one of them would also bow out.And yet, even if none of these new candidates become president this year, they have given Nigerians a glimpse of what might be possible in our political future. It is possible to have a president who has not plotted a coup. It is possible to have a president who doesn’t have corruption allegations hovering around his administration, like flies around a corpse. It is possible to have a president who doesn’t make Nigerians duck with shame once he opens his mouth and reveals his lack of ideas.A cousin of mine, the most politically apathetic person I know, sent me a video of Durotoye and asked, “Who is this guy? Can he win?” If he, and the other new candidates, can spark hope in someone who has long since washed their hands of the Nigerian political process, then who knows? Perhaps a new Nigeria is coming. There are many in the old guard who had better start packing.• Chibundu Onuzo is a Nigerian writer.

The hedge fund’s decision to move on was linked in the press to novelist Sebastian Faulks’s negative comments about the firm last year, made on the How to Fail podcast . The Man Group, he said, are “not the sort of people who should be sponsoring literary prizes, they’re the kind of people literary figures ought to be criticising … They’re kind of the enemy”. The prize, he said, became “terribly irritating” when Man took it over and he himself would not be prepared to take “50 big ones” from the company, in the unlikely event of its being awarded to him. Luke Ellis, the head of the Man Group, referred to these remarks at the 2018 prize ceremony, and there has been speculation that he withdrew the company’s sponsorship in a fit of umbrage.Perhaps disobliging remarks such as this do not help smooth the frequently uncomfortable relationship between art and commerce. But correlation is not causation, and the Man Group’s removal of support is, insiders insist, more to do with its changing priorities around corporate responsibility than anger at outspoken authors. Those close to the Booker say Man Group’s departure has been known for months, but that this year’s prizes – both for English-language fiction and its international award – will carry the Man name. A fresh sponsor will be announced in weeks. They also say the controversial decision to include American writers among those eligible for the prize is both irrelevant to the Man Group’s decision and not up for revision.The affair brings into relief the difficulties that attend upon corporate arts sponsorship. The British Museum, Tate and others were subject to ongoing criticism and regular protests when they took money from BP. Recently, protests have been made against museums’ acceptance of funds from the parts of the Sackler family that have been enriched by the opioid OxyContin. Last year, defence company BAE Systems withdrew its support for the Great Exhibition of the North after an online petition criticised its involvement. Meanwhile, over the years, cultural organisations have accepted money from any number of inidual patrons whose sources of wealth may have not been entirely savoury.These matters are delicate. It is fair to say that corporate sponsorship is always done with at least half an eye on enhancing a brand. But it is not invariably a case of evil conglomerates laundering corporate dirt in the cleansing waters of culture. Such a binary view of the world is naive when almost nobody, and few organisations, can possibly exist untouched by the compromises demanded by life within the matrix of global capitalism. It would be equally naive to suggest that cultural organisations should accept whatever they can get, from whatever source of course they should, and do, scrutinise potential sponsors before embarking on partnerships.Corporate sponsorship in the arts is only going to become more difficult as Brexit creates uncertainty, especially for European firms, and, at the same time, companies begin to question the optics of gala nights and glitzy corporate entertainment packages that some (in reality only a very few) cultural organisations can offer. Long-term support is especially hard to secure in the current climate. This is territory that can be negotiated only with an open mind, a strong ethical backbone and good sense. But with public funding cuts, there is little alternative but for arts organisations to try to do so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79c3c78a9199159082d5d209a8397bb2bbd35456/0_112_2514_1508/master/2514.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=210b82628114bb781588b512a04e2bb6","title":"the guardian view on indias mr modi suppressing inconvenient facts","story":"Narendra Modi’s 2014 election victory in India, the most resounding for 25 years, was built on two weaknesses: the shattered credibility of his opponents in the Congress party and the economic downturn the country was experiencing. One of Mr Modi’s most memorable campaign pledges was to create 10m jobs a year, or about 840,000 jobs a month. It was a promise that resonated across India’s caste ides for young people, who represent roughly two-thirds of nation’s population of 1.35 billion. However, it turns out Mr Modi’s Bharitya Janata party (BJP) government has been creating jobs – just not enough.Rather than admit this, Mr Modi’s government sat on the official report detailing the scale of the problem. Two senior officials at India’s National Statistical Commission resigned, and then a draft report was leaked showing that unemployment had climbed to its highest rate in 45 years. Almost one in six rural young men were unemployed. None of this should surprise anyone: last year it was reported that 93,000 people applied for 62 jobs as government clerks. It is also true that in the absence of a comprehensive welfare system, few Indians can afford not to work. Most end up self-employed or taking informal jobs to earn cash.Yet instead of admitting to its failure to meet its ambitions, the government has been caught hiding the facts and calling into question how it could credibly be held to account. To perhaps obscure negative headlines in the run-up to this year’s general election, Mr Modi’s finance minister broke with convention to present a budget of electoral sops to 120 million poor farmers, tax cuts to India’s middle class and a pension bung to urban young workers.Mr Modi is facing a familiar problem in India. Despite impressive rates of growth for decades, many of India’s poorest people have yet to feel the benefits. Mr Modi trumpets India as the fastest-growing major economy in the world. He’s not too keen about the fact that very little has trickled down in the form of jobs. He ought to take a broader view of what development is about, especially given the country’s extreme social inequalities.

Fashion is having an ambivalent moment and, with shoppers apparently unwilling or unable to choose between two distinct designs, the trend for “pre-clashed clothes” is growing.At high street retailer Zara, there are dresses with ditsy prints alongside big swirling florals, as well as wrap dresses in contrasting colour blocks, usually with a vertical split. At both Rixo and Kitri, blue blooms jar with neighbouring polka dots – a dress in this design has become Kitri’s bestselling item since it launched earlier this month. Rixo also stocks a range of skirts, tops and dusters featuring “abstract florals” clashed together on a single item, while at Topshop, a pair of mom jeans sees black denim vie with another of this year’s biggest trends – leopard print – with a leg in each material. Across the board, the question appears to be: why wear just one print, when you can wear two – or more?On the catwalk, the “half-and-half” look was big at Marni, Gucci and Sacai where it ned dresses and coats as part of AW18 collections. More recently, Gosha Rubchinskiy sent macs in black and beige down the catwalk as part of his SS19 show for Burberry – as well as one mac comprising half of each. On the red carpet and elsewhere, celebrities including Suki Waterhouse, Sigourney Weaver and Rita Ora have also adopted the “split” or “ambivalent” dressing trend.Pre-clashed clothes are a progression from last summer’s matchy-mismatchy layering – a nod to nonchalance and no-rules dressing. In the current climate, the look can certainly be seen to embody a “have your cake and eat it” mindset, but it’s not the first time this trend has proved popular. In the early 80s, Elton John favoured a monochrome half-and-half suit, and the 70s embraced psychedelic florals meshed together for a mismatched look. Earlier still, pre-clashed clothes were fashionable for a more practical reason, according to Susanna Cordner, senior research fellow at the London College of Fashion.“Elaborate and matching print designs require the pattern on the fabric to be perfectly aligned ... which can result in metres of fabric being wasted,” says Cordner. “This was a proponent for ditsy and contrasting prints in the 1930s and 1940s, as they were seen as a way of creating maximum effect with minimum waste.”Be it sustainable styling or organised chaos, it’s a trend that’s set to stick around far beyond 29 March. “It’s a way to give the customer something a bit quirky without the customer having to work it out for themselves,” says the fashion historian Tony Glenville. “At its chicest, it’s spots with stripes or geometrics with florals. It’s less fashion and more collage or assemblage the unlikely forced into a new harmony. I think we need look no further than the state of the world to understand why this might be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b338a193a2ba3a3c7196cad2854138d6da85051/107_435_5136_3082/master/5136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2ba8aadb73fe3f0d3e380cc0733f392","title":"haute couture captured a photo essay from the ss19 shows","story":"From Valentino to Viktor \u0026amp Rolf, Chanel to Dior, the shows in January delivered a dazzling insight into the world of haute coutureby  Jo Jones,  Scarlett Conlon and  Matt FidlerThe gilets jaunes protests of January may have threatened to derail couture fashion week by disrupting deliveries and blocking access to studios, but designers beat the odds to deliver another show-stopping season, honouring their hard-won spot on the hallowed schedule. From Valentino reducing the audience to tears to Viktor \u0026amp Rolf’s meme-inducing dresses, this season delivered headlines and viral crazes on social media, making sure there was something for everyone to enjoy.The Chanel couture show may have made headlines for the absence of Karl Lagerfeld (he was tired, said the house, so his long-time right-hand woman Virginie Viard took the bow with the bride instead), but there was an abundance of style notes to be made from the runway. Staged at Chanel’s regular haunt – the Grand Palais – against an Italianate villa imagined through a trompe l’oeil cyclorama, it featured models meandering around the orange trees in impeccably tailored monochrome skirt suits with kick-flare hems, exquisite puff-ball dresses, and appliquéd gowns with tulle shoulders that splayed out like fans.Naturally, its couture status cranked this collection up a notch. One dress was embroidered in real flowers preserved in resin to last for ever. And the bride? She wore a bejewelled swimsuit. As Coco Chanel said: “There is no time for cut-and-dried monotony.”“In a circus parade, it is not just about being beautiful – it is about being proud, about being strong, about being bold and having fun.” So said Christian Dior’s creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri, backstage before the show, making a clear comparison between the circus stimuli she adopted for this show and the tribe she has sought to create since she was appointed at the house. Chiuri’s collections have been about female empowerment from the get-go and this outing was no different. As befitted the circus staging (the London-based Mimbre theatre group performing as the models made their entrance), the palette was playful. Several silhouettes riffed on the larger-than-life look of a classic clown, all candy-stripes, ruffle collars, big bow-ties and balloon sleeves. Chiuri’s signature embellished floor-length gowns, meanwhile, gave balance to the bolder pieces, emanating a quiet confidence. It was a class act.Latex and couture are not what you would call frequent bedfellows. Yet, in a way only the marvellous Clare Waight Keller can do, they fused to form a collection that showed the designer – now into her third couture season with the house – is ready to have fun. “Latex is very couture, because it’s the most bespoke fabric you can get, in terms of a second skin fit,” she told the ’s Jess Cartner-Morley after the show. In her own words, she wanted to make it “as modern as possible. I wanted absolute purity: tailoring, technique, clean lines and saturated colour.”As a result, asymmetric tuxedo jackets were worn with skinny leggings a sporty racer-style top became a sweeping gown complete with a clean-lined cape and models with large, squishy backpacks edged with angel wings streamed into the white box of a room that took four months to design and five days to install. In other words, a clean slate. Lines were sculpted yet structural, pitting strength against fragility and creating the most potent of couture juxtapositions.Guo Pei mined her Chinese heritage for her latest couture outing. Calling it East Palace, she brought the Hall of Supreme Harmony in Beijing’s Forbidden City to the heart of Paris, recreating it in the vast underbelly of the Palais de Tokyo. Taking her cue from the architecture of ancient Chinese palaces, her designs appeared stoic and structured, all the time with a delicate celestial magnificence. Accordingly, she bestowed a ceremonial atmosphere on proceedings: models glided by slowly in richly embroidered silk gowns in an opulent palette of golds, molten silver, ruby reds and sapphire blue.Much like Clare Waight Keller at Dior, designer Tamara Ralph was also in the mood to have fun this season. Drawing inspiration from María Félix for the British couture house’s latest outing - who Ralph described as “the most famous Mexican a of all time” - she steered her delicate designs down a lavish and extravagant path. Bright and bold from the offset, fuchsia pinks and the grassiest of greens were cut into power-shouldered and beaded suits bandeau dresses with sweetheart necklines came with all-over tassels black leather gloves were worn with intricately embellished bodices and wide-brimmed hats and iridescent fringing made several looks perfect for a spin on any a-approved dance floor.Enter the wonderful world of Maison Schiaparelli, home of the most wondrous and idiosyncratic archive, which the creative director Bertrand Guyon continues to mine with aplomb. While an eight-months-pregnant Erin O’Connor closed the show and dominated the subsequent headlines in a spectacular sunset-orange, hot-pink and tomato-red tiered tulle gown, the galactic-inspired looks that came before her were as noteworthy. The theme appeared on skirts featuring diamanté-embellished clusters and star-fastened capes as a rocket taking off past a waistline and in a zodiac-constellation motif. Back down on Earth, florals were in bloom across the show, while the most beloved trimming of couture designers – the ostrich feather – contributed appropriate levels of frou to the atelier’s flou.It was the show that brought the front row to tears and cemented Pierpaolo Piccioli’s status as a master couturier. “For me, it’s about more than clothes,” he said backstage, which is always a good place to start when it comes to couture. These are creations that far exceed the emotional expectations of mere garments – and the audience reaction to this outing confirmed it.The collection was a colour explosion, rapturous in salmon pink, spearmint, royal blue, regal purple and, of course, Valentino red while all eyes were on, well, the eyes, thanks to makeup artist Pat McGrath’s sensational feathered eyes. Naomi Campbell appeared in a sheer and tiered ballgown to close the show. Afterwards, she congratulated Piccioli on Instagram for “a historical moment, done in such an elegant manner”, adding that she was “blessed to be part of such an incredible, spellbinding moment”.A great of his generation, Giambattista Valli looked to the greatness of Yves Saint Laurent for inspiration this season – specifically a 1977 Helmut Newton photograph of models resplendent in his salon. A lifelong fan of the late couturier, Valli paid tribute with decadently beaded cocktail dresses complete with an asymmetric flourish and the fezs worn by every model. A tale of two halves, hemlines ranged from thigh-skimming to floor-sweeping, while gowns got an update via stomping cowboy boots.It was the collection that launched a thousand memes: “No photos please”, “I’m not shy, I just don’t like you” and “Sorry I’m late, I didn’t want to come”. Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren’s sloganed gowns may look incongurous when pitted side by side with the splendour and refinement associated with couture, but it captured the imagination of the internet at large (everyone’s head, from Anna Wintour to Fyre Festival’s Billy McFarland, has been superimposed on one of these dresses). The wording certainly gave a new relevance to the sartorial genre, but that stands up only if the technique is top notch, too – and it was. The lengths of tulle and silk were pinned with the perfection demanded from a spot on the exclusive haute couture schedule."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6847c844d5f939087697705ea7fd8be9a9398681/230_196_2065_1239/master/2065.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72613b8f13623422618e5c750f24d072","title":"fiji water girl suing company following golden globes hostess gig","story":"Fiji Water says lawsuit by model Kelleth Cuthbert, whose images on the red carpet went viral, is ‘frivolous’ and ‘without merit’Forget Glenn Close.

So accessible, so speedy to cook, so sweetly flavourful, and a brilliant source of protein. At this time of year I rely on them to add freshness when most other green veg is a distant memory. This week, I cooked them with potatoes, lemons and feta to make a family-friendly traybake, and the pea and coconut soup is a go-to, made with things I usually have to hand.Use a tray large enough that the potato chunks have space on the tray or they won’t cook as evenly. Vegans could use firm tofu in place of the feta – or use neither and it will still be good.1kg maris piper potatoes, unpeeled and cut into chunks2 lemons, seeds removed, cut into quarters4 garlic clovesLeaves from 1 sprig fresh thyme1 pinch Aleppo pepper or Turkish chilli flakesOlive oil200g fetaSalt and black pepper150g frozen peasSmall bunch soft herbs (I used mint)Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzlingHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)400Fgas 6. Tumble the potatoes on to a 30cm x 40cm baking tray and squeeze over two of the lemon pieces, then toss the rinds into the tray with the rest of the unsqueezed lemons. Add the garlic, thyme and chilli flakes and a generous glug of olive oil. Season well with salt and pepper, toss everything together, and make sure everything is coated with oil.Break the feta into large chunks and sprinkle it over the potatoes. Drizzle with oil again, then bake for 45 minutes, until the potatoes are crisp and the feta is chewy in the middle and crisp on top.Remove from the oven, then prepare the peas. Put them in a bowl, pour boiling water over them for 30 seconds, then drain. Sprinkle the peas into the tray and put it back into the oven for another few minutes. Top with the fresh herbs, then drizzle with plenty of extra-virgin olive oil. The lemons have done their work now and will have transferred all their favour to the potatoes, so scoop them out before serving in the middle of the table.When I am hungry, impatient and have nothing in the fridge, this vegan soup is the recipe I turn to. To be really speedy, the pan you use is important a small, deep saucepan will mean your soup won’t come to a simmer quickly, so I suggest a deep, wide one – cast iron is ideal. If you don’t have spring onions, a normal onion will do fine you may just need to cook it for a little longer.1 bunch spring onions1 tsp coconut oil1kg frozen peas1 × 400ml tin coconut milk, reserving a little of the cream, beaten, for drizzling1 tbsp vegetable stock powder, or ½ stock cube1 bunch basil or coriander (or a mixture of both)1 limeExtra-virgin olive oilFill and boil a kettle, and get all your ingredients and equipment together, ready to go. Put a large, shallow soup pan, one that has a lid, over a medium heat to warm it up.Chop the spring onions quite finely and put into the pan with the coconut oil. Turn up to the highest heat and cook for two minutes, until softened.Add the peas to the pan with the coconut milk, the stock powder or cube and 750ml boiling water, then cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, simmer, still on a high heat, for two to three minutes.Remove from the heat. Add most of the herbs, stalks and all, and the juice of the lime, and use a stick blender to blitz the soup until it’s super‑smooth.Serve ladled into bowls with a little olive oil and the rest of the herbs.

The primary aspiration this season was always writ large: get Arsenal back into the Champions League any which way. So to try to get the measure of where his team stand, what their chances are and also forage for clues to improvement, he has been busy examining Premier League trends to bring reassurance they are on the right track.“I use a lot of information about the previous years in the Premier League of other teams and also our team,” he says. “I remember three years ago Liverpool were playing in the final of the Europa League, they were in the top four in the table in the Premier League. Their progress is very good progress. Maybe Manchester City is a different example, because they bought important players, paying a lot, and maybe we can’t do that. But our way is we can do something similar to Liverpool, similar to Tottenham, doing more with young players, using players well who can improve with us. We are doing that. We need time, but also we need to be very demanding of ourselves.”Six months since Emery’s first Premier League match, a free pass at home to Manchester City that ended more or less as expected with his experimental side dominated by the serene champions, Arsenal face City again. It seems like a useful time to try to assess the level of progress. We can calculate the tangibles: they are five points better off than this time last season and two positions higher in the table having snuck a little fortuitously back into fourth at Chelsea’s expense. They are not quite so far behind the league leaders (14 points compared with 23 last time). They were out of both domestic cups before the snow came, never mind melted.But it is the thing you cannot chronicle with statistics that matters even more for Arsenal’s longer term. What exactly is Arsenal’s identity under Emery? Should it be more defined by now? Even if there are mitigating circumstances, particularly with a curse on his defence that makes them drop like flies, is it reasonable to wonder whether Arsenal should be slightly more Emerified in their approach?Last weekend, as Arsenal were picked off by Manchester United, the question of team identity felt sharpened. United exhibited a style that seemed so familiar and Ole Gunnar Solskjær rubbed it in by explaining how he had shown his team videos of successful counterattacking goals targeting the very worst of Arsenal, with an overstretched defence more or less pointing neon signs behind the full-backs saying “Space this way”.Even if Solskjær has made it look easy by sorting out a clearly defined and inspirational method in a few weeks, it is not always that finger-clickingly simple. The challenge to create a team in his own image has been problematic for Emery because the tools he has to work with are not in many cases the ones he would have chosen, and half the time quite a few of those tools have needed fixing themselves. It is awful luck to lose some of the players who have shown the most improvement under Emery to long-term injury – Héctor Bellerín and Rob Holding particularly – along with Danny Welbeck, whose work ethic would have appealed. The Mesut Özil (�� below) conundrum is a continuing complication. The fatigue suffered by Lucas Torreira after his initial tornado of form has not helped.Rewinding to the day Emery was announced as Arsenal’s chosen one to be the post-Wenger answer, he outlined his stylistic ideas. “I like to win the ball back as quickly as possible. It’s about two things: possession and pressing. We want to play looking forwards.” His mission statement was to “be among the best and beat the best”.There have been flashes of high-intensity football from Arsenal – the best example being a blistering second-half comeback in the league game against Tottenham – but there have been plenty of games lacking that edge and energy. Only a few days ago against Cardiff they toiled, mostly pedestrian, not particularly cohesive, thankful for the inidual attacking qualities of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette. The worst games, the ones that seem to completely lack Emery’s ideas of winning the ball back quickly, pressing and playing forwards, reared an ugly head in the humiliation at Anfield, for example. Overall it has been a mixed bag, with the manager tinkering repeatedly with players, formations and ideas, which is why it is so difficult to figure out exactly what Emery is trying to achieve this season with this group of players. Just over eight months after he was appointed, evidence of a stylistic shift away from the years of Wengerism remains cloudy.Now to the Etihad. Emery tries to stress that Arsenal need the points just as much as City for their own reasons. “Usually we want to have the possession more than the opposition but against Manchester City, maybe I think it is not possible. It’s a very big challenge for us to prepare for this match,” he concedes.His admiration for Guardiola is unstinting, even if he has the luck to work with such refined squads. “I have analysed a lot of teams and coaches and I think it’s difficult to find one coach who is better than Guardiola. He has had the possibility to take the best players at Barcelona, in Bayern and in City little by little. Every year he is improving with great players and also paying a lot for new players but he led them, at Barcelona, Bayern and City, one step more every place. This, for me, is the quality that makes me say he is the best.”Without quite the same luxuries, Emery continues to plot his path towards the improvement he craves, the intensity he loves and the consistency of style he hopes will come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherWe’re looking for unusual partnerships – two people who live together in a way that shows the changing nature of the traditional household – for our new series that seeks to reflect how the place we call home can now include extended family, friends and even strangers.In the first piece in a series talking to pairs of people who live together we met the McPhersons, a grandmother and grandson living together who tell us their story.

He had just turned 50 and had suffered the loss of his estranged father, so he had reasons enough to evaluate his life. There are worse problems than a vegan partner, but I am not handling it well. I go through periods of avoiding eating and cooking with him. I don’t want to offend him, and I don’t want him to offend me. I don’t believe veganism is a good choice for personal or planetary health, and I feel healthier on a low-carb diet we both realise we are not going to persuade each other to change diets.He has lost lots of weight and looks great, and is happy with his choice. But I feel sad that he may never cook another delicious chicken dinner for me, and I am seething underneath that he immerses himself in vegan “propaganda” and has withdrawn from the family culinary traditions. To be fair, I lack a love for beans and avoid starch, so he isn’t left with much choice except withdrawal.Following his bereavement and period of grieving, he hasn’t been as easy to live with, and we are also dealing with the ups and downs of our teenage children. I really miss connecting over a good dinner and wish he would go back to being an omnivore.Food is incredibly emotive and can unite and ide. It can therefore be tricky if family members eat different foods, but it’s usually a logistical problem. No less an issue, but this also seems emotional and personal. It’s almost as if you don’t know who your husband is any more. I am presuming he will no longer prepare any food that is not vegan. What do the children eat? Does this put the burden of cooking on to you?There was a lot of loss in your letter for both of you. Your partner’s father has died and, while the death of an estranged parent hardly affects some, with others it can go deep. This can be because, with the demise of that parent goes any hope of ever repairing the relationship. The sadness some adult children feel in these situations can take them by surprise.In what ways wasn’t your husband “as easy to live with” after his father’s death? I also noted you said “period of grieving”, as if you feel it should be a finite amount of time – it’s not.And then there’s you you feel you’ve lost your husband and some of the things you shared, and that must be hard for you. I understand about the communion in cooking and eating together, but you seem to see his veganism as an assault on your relationship, and you’ve both withdrawn. Were things really OK before this, for both of you? It sounds as if he is determined to do this, but you sound as if you are determined to hate it, and that tells me more about your relationship than your shopping list.When people aren’t happy, they tend to look for differences between them to justify their unhappiness, and ignore what unites them when happy, they celebrate the similarities and ignore areas of conflict. What you both need to do is look at where your likes and interests intersect, however vanishingly small that feels, and concentrate on expanding these things.This is a seismic shift for you in the kitchen, but veganism isn’t – or doesn’t have to be – all starch and beans. There are some amazing cookbooks now, with recipes that even hardened meat-eaters find exciting, which could give you some culinary crossover.But before you get there: food is just one aspect of your relationship. I wonder if your husband discussed this with you, or just did it and you feel left behind. How do you communicate usually? Is this the last straw, or a new way of him behaving? What else do you have in common? What are his attributes? You mentioned nothing else about him.You may not feel you can cook or eat together at the moment, but can you start a conversation that lets him know how you feel, without making his choices feel invalid and small?

It also calls upon working producers to remain conscious of gender ersity “within music’s technical fields” when selecting proteges and young hires.The other artists supporting the initiative include Katy Perry, Cardi B, Common, John Legend, Keith Urban, Brandi Carlile, Chance the Rapper, Selena Gomez, Sharon Van Etten, Maroon 5, Halsey, 2 Chainz, Tegan and Sara, Troye Sivan, Pink, Maggie Rogers, Nicki Minaj, Missy Elliott, Ryan Adams and the Chainsmokers.Leading producers such as Quincy Jones, Jimmy Jam, Max Martin, Diplo and Jack Antonoff have also given their backing, in addition to such labels as Columbia, Big Machine, Epic, Glassnote, Def Jam and RCA.The producer and engineering inclusion initiative is the creation of the Recording Academy’s taskforce for ersity and inclusion, which was formed after the 2018 Grammy awards were criticised for failing to recognise the achievements of female artists and hip-hop stars. Out of 86 categories, only 17 were won by women or bands fronted by women, and only one – Alessia Cara for best new artist – in a major, televised category.Recording Academy president Neil Portnow received criticism from artists including Pink and Sheryl Crow for suggesting that women needed to “step up” if they wanted to achieve success in the music industry. The backlash led Portnow to announce his resignation following the 2019 ceremony and to the formation of the ersity taskforce.The taskforce is is led by Tina Tchen, a former chief of staff to Michelle Obama. Tchen described the producer and engineering inclusion initiative as “overdue”, adding: “There is no magic bullet to shift a status quo that has existed for centuries, but we see this initiative as an important step. We aren’t here to tell anyone who to hire, but we have seen repeatedly that the simple act of making sure erse candidates are always seen and considered makes it more likely that women will get the opportunities they previously have been denied.”The nominations for the 2019 Grammys are led by Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Cardi B and crossover country star Maren Morris. Changes to this year’s ceremony include the expansion of the major categories from five nominees to eight, permitting “a broader opportunity for more representation”, as Portnow told Rolling Stone. The Recording Academy invited 900 new industry figures to join its nominating committee.Portnow added: “I think we’ve opened the discussion, created the beginning of tangible means to address it and now we have to stick with it. Ultimately it’s the industry that has to also focus on these issues.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91a804b275e8c07b51e9a787209eadecee94b7b0/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ef40b6f41e9ca1ed3ce864b4b4e67e4","title":"labour may proposals for workers rights likely to be rejected","story":"Party chair warns against allowing prime minister to ide and rule over Brexit Labour and leading trade unions have said they are unlikely to endorse any proposals from Theresa May aimed at improving workers’ rights after Brexit, with one leading figure accusing the prime minister of trying to “ide and rule”.Trade unions involved in discussing a possible workers’ rights package, which the government hopes will help some Labour MPs support its Brexit deal, said they had yet to see anything from ministers they could support.Union sources said they would want to see the government commit to putting future protection for workers’ rights in the Brexit agreement struck with the European Union, rather than in UK legislation that could be repealed by a future government.They said May had shown no sign of taking on board their concerns about existing labour market regulation, under which, according to one official, an average UK employer “can expect a visit from an enforcement agency once every 500 years”.The prime minister met several union leaders last week, including Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary who is a key supporter of Jeremy Corbyn the Unison leader, Dave Prentis and Frances O’Grady, who heads the TUC. Union officials held meetings with civil servants on Thursday.Greg Clark, the business secretary, and Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, are working on legislation that unions believe would commit the government to not lowering standards on employment, environmental protection and health and safety after Brexit.As well as demanding that such protections are inserted into the exit treaty, unions want a binding commitment that the UK will match any improvements passed by the EU. So far, the government has said only that parliament would be able to vote on whether such improvements should be matched.The ministers have also been talking to Labour backbenchers in leave-supporting areas, including John Mann, in the hope of getting at least a dozen to back May’s deal and make up for the lost votes of Tory Brexiters who will not support any deal May strikes with the EU.The talks have included the idea of creating a “transformation fund” which could be invested in mining communities and other post-industrial, leave-supporting areas to support job creation, according to Mann.Ian Lavery, Labour’s chair, said backbenchers should be careful about talking to the government, and that the prime minister was trying “the last move in the well-thumbed Tory playbook: ide and rule”.“Any Labour MP seriously considering discussions with the PM should remember her record and that of her party going back generations. Quite simply, taking such a bribe would be fool’s gold,” he wrote in an article for Labour List.Downing Street indicated on Friday that any transformation fund would not only cover areas represented by Labour MPs and would take in other deprived areas, such as fishing and other coastal towns.The prime minister’s spokesman declined to give any details about the plans, but said any such initiative would cover “every part of the country” that needed investment, not just mining areas.May spent Friday in her Maidenhead constituency as she continues to work on alternative proposals to resolve the Brexit impasse.She is examining three options to deal with the unpopular Irish backstop, which is aimed at keeping the border open in case no long-term trade deal can be agreed. They are a time limit, a unilateral exit mechanism and alternative technological arrangements put to her by Tory backbenchers last week.Her spokesman said May had no immediate plans to restart negotiations, or travel to Brussels, partly because Downing Street’s strategy continues to be to hope that EU leaders will reflect on her call to reopen the withdrawal agreement to remove the backstop, which the EU says is integral to a deal.It is not clear when May will be able to present her revised Brexit plan. If she fails to do so by 13 February, she must make a statement before parliament and invite MPs to vote the following day on what they would like to see happen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14692bb778fe1032d0080eebe5e9447131317c0a/0_257_5100_3061/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=357b05092e57d0cc294224c17c7c1c50","title":"revealed plan to deal with putrefying stockpiles of rubbish after no deal brexit","story":"Exclusive: leaked emails show officials planning crisis centres to manage halt in waste exports to EUGovernment officials are preparing to deal with “putrefying stockpiles” of rubbish in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to documents leaked to the .If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, export licences for millions of tonnes of waste will become invalid overnight. Environment Agency (EA) officials said leaking stockpiles could cause pollution.The EA is also concerned that if farmers cannot export beef and lamb, a backlog of livestock on farms could cause liquid manure stores to overflow. A senior MP said the problems could cause a public health and environmental pollution emergency. An EA source said: “It could all get very ugly, very quickly.”The emails leaked to the  were sent to EA staff, asking for 42 volunteers to staff crisis management centres that would deal with incidents. On Tuesday the chief executive of the civil service revealed plans to move up to 5,000 staff into an emergency command and control centre in the event of no deal.An EA email sent on Thursday, labelled “importance: high”, said crisis centres could go live on 18 February and run from 7am to 8pm seven days a week, with plans to operate 247 if needed. To explain the potential tasks, the email gave two examples.“If there is a no-deal scenario, the current export of waste may cease for a period. This could result in stockpiled waste which causes licence breaches,” the email said. “Odours will obviously be an issue as the stockpiled waste putrefies and there may be runoff of leachates, causing secondary pollution.”The email said the waste could become a high-profile issue. “It will quickly escalate into a political one because the operators will state that they have no means to move the waste.”The second example related to animal slurry. “Problems may arise in exporting livestock to the EU. In that situation, farmers may be overstocked and unable to export lambbeef etc. That means that they may have problems with slurry storage capacity and insufficient land spreading capability.”The EA source said: “The examples seem like real possibilities. There’s a serious amount of panic going on.” Mary Creagh, the chair of parliament’s environmental audit committee, said: “The UK’s waste and recycling system is already fragile but these shocking emails show it will grind to a halt if customs checks and WTO tariffs prevent the export of millions of tonnes of waste.”“No deal would be a green light to criminal fraudsters and create a public health and environmental pollution emergency. EA officials should not carry the can for the failings of government to get a deal through and this shows how hollow the prime minister’s promises were about protecting the environment if we leave the EU.”An EA spokesman said: “As with the whole of government and the rest of the public sector, we are preparing responsibly for all scenarios as we exit the EU.”As well as recycling waste, the UK ships about 3m tonnes of rubbish a year to the EU to be burned in incinerators that generate electricity. Most of this is household rubbish, which is sometimes shredded and has metal removed before being sent abroad. If waste has to be stockpiled after a no-deal Brexit, industry experts say the populous south-east of England would be worst affected. The UK’s lack of incinerator capacity and shrinking number of landfill sites drives the exports.The government issued a technical notice in December stating that “if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, importexport licences issued by the UK would no longer be valid for shipments of waste to the 27 remaining EU countries from the day the UK leaves.” The notice added: “There is currently no process set out in the EU waste shipment regulations on how notified shipments should be re-approved. Defra is contacting other EU countries to discuss arrangements.”Stuart Hayward-Higham, who leads Brexit planning for Suez, one of the UK’s largest waste management firms, said the EA’s planning was sensible: “It is them just putting things in place in case they need them.”In September the National Audit Office warned ministers that plans for the continued export of animal products such as beef were far behind the needed schedule. After 29 March in a no-deal scenario, such products will require export health certificates (EHCs), which need to be signed by an official veterinarian after an inspection.Potential delays in issuing EHCs could leave farmers with more livestock than expected and more manure than they can deal with. Last month a government air pollution strategy proposed in effect a ban on muck-spreading, where fields are sprayed with liquid manure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ad29ece82935cdf4a6cc685049e6cd569d309c3/0_251_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=184882442aeb6c4d82a89ed665787582","title":"universal credit scores lowest for satisfaction in benefits survey","story":"Official findings reveal one in 10 claimants were ‘very dissatisfied’ with experienceUniversal credit has the lowest claimant satisfaction rates of any welfare benefit, according to an official survey that suggests tens of thousands of people are being left frustrated by their experience of the government’s flagship programme.One in 10 claimants told the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) they were “very dissatisfied” with their experience of universal credit, and they reported significant levels of discontent with the quality and effectiveness of the service they received.Campaigners said the survey confirmed there were still “fundamental problems” with universal credit and called for it to be closed to new claims while the issues are fixed.The chief executive of the charity Child Poverty Action Group, Alison Garnham, said: “The work and pensions secretary has said she is listening to concerns about how universal credit plays out on the ground. Will she listen to the many people who responded to this survey to report ongoing problems?“The ministerial refrain is that universal credit is a force for good but the DWP’s own survey shows in reality there are still fundamental problems. Overall, satisfaction rates among universal credit claimants are worse than for any other DWP benefit. That is not where universal credit should be.”A DWP spokesperson said: “Overall satisfaction among claimants has remained consistently high over the last three years. Four out of five claimants are satisfied with the support they have received when claiming universal credit and this survey plays a vital role in helping us improve this number even more.”At the time of the survey there were about 600,000 universal credit claimants. The results equate to approximately 114,000 “dissatisfied” claimants, of whom 60,000 were “very dissatisfied”. There are nowabout 1.6 million claimants, and it is expected that by 2023 there will be approximately 7 million.Increased claimant satisfaction is a key success measure for the benefit as set out in the DWP’s business case to the Treasury.One in six respondents said they did not have internet access at home, suggesting they relied on computers in libraries, cafes or jobcentres to apply for, or update their claim for, the primarily online benefit.The survey appears to contradict claims by the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, last month that persistent media reports of problems with universal credit were based on “one or two people where the advice hasn’t worked for them”.She said the new benefit was an improvement on the previous “broken” system. However, the 2017-18 survey shows it lags behind satisfaction rates for employment and support allowance, income support, and jobseekers’ allowance, all of which are being merged into universal credit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d33ddba5b34e10053d5129d4ff372bb0360d58c/0_197_4073_2444/master/4073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a3f273c790baf48bce677138f0242da","title":"france wales six nations 2019 match report","story":"• France 19-24 Wales• Wing North capitalises on French mistakes with two triesMadness – but is it not always between these two? Or, at the very least, when France play. Still there is no knowing who or where they are. Les Bleus tore Wales apart in the first half – as much as any side can be torn apart in rain like this. The visitors did not know where to turn, their quiet confidence before this tournament shredded, their composure shot.France went into the break with a 16-0 lead but it could have been more, Morgan Parra missing three kicks at goal. No international side should lose a lead like that at home – not even France. How they laugh in the face of received wisdom. Here they handed Wales the game in the most agonising manner, yielding three tries in the second half, each one softer than the previous, the third just after they had regained a lead they had somehow lost with nearly 20 minutes to play.And so Wales claimed a 10th consecutive win with this, the biggest comeback in their history. “The big difference between the two,” said Warren Gatland, “is that we’ve become a side that have forgotten how to lose and France are a side still looking for confidence.”It was unbearable to watch, such had been France’s form in the first half. Wales were braced for a battering by one of the heaviest packs known to rugby, nearly 50kg heavier than their own. When the rain set in an hour or so before kick-off that expectation turned into an assumption. Sure enough, France confounded us all there too. French power up front was the least of Wales’s problems.Les Bleus had also picked a backline of more traditional elan and they were not afraid to use it. Threats came at Wales from every player, one to 15, and never once from anything so slow or predictable as a rumble up front. Louis Picamoles cut back after one fluent move to score the game’s first try after only five minutes. At the start of the second quarter France had their second.Damian Penaud cut Wales up down the right, the French midfield conveyed the ball sweetly left where Arthur Iturria, yet another threat, this one unexpected on the flank, released Yoann Huget for the corner and a 10-0 lead. This time two years ago, in the infamous 100-minute match, Wales had been kept in the match by the boot of Leigh Halfpenny. He was absent here, which was a mixed blessing. No reliable marksman but at least Liam Williams could showcase his talents.As ever he proved Wales’s most threatening player. After one slashing run he was denied only by Picamoles’s tackle. Then another run won Wales a penalty. Gareth Anscombe was given the tee in Halfpenny’s absence and missed that shot at goal and another in the first half, a failing that seemed to spread to the rest of his game. He and his half-back partner, Tomos Williams on his Six Nations debut, endured a torrid time in that first half. On the approach to the break Williams carried over and France won a penalty from the subsequent play, which Camille Lopez converted. On the stroke of half-time Lopez extended the lead with an audacious drop goal.But this is France. No one is ever quite safe against them, but neither are they ever quite beaten by them. Sure enough, nothing looked on as Wales swung the ball aimlessly back and forth five minutes into the second half, but Josh Adams suddenly waltzed clean through France’s fringe defence to find Williams on hand for the try. Redemption for the young scrum-half just before he was replaced. In between, though, Wales struck again and this time the gift from France was toe-curling.A nothing kick to the try line from Hadleigh Parkes was fumbled by Huget and George North scooped up the ball to touch it down. Wales, barely 10 minutes into the second half, were within two points. They thought they were ahead just a few minutes after that. Ross Moriarty went over but he was called back for obstruction. Worse, a penalty that might have calmed French nerves was pushed wide by Lopez.Now it was France’s composure that was shot. And their lead followed. Dan Biggar does not tend to miss and his penalty had Wales ahead on the hour. It had come from a scrum, the very area we had expected France to dominate. Expectation – indeed, reason itself – had left the building. So at the next scrum, penalty, of course, to France and Lopez, with 10 minutes to go, put France back in the lead.Then the maddest moment of them all. Sébastien Vahaamahina, one of France’s biggest, decided to fling a 30-metre pass as if he were France’s deftest. North again pounced on it to gallop home. Wales got away with this one. France will be, well, mad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eddcbd8a45d36c73ee5185f804dc0bf4966a3e02/44_0_4534_2721/master/4534.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=168801eeca1ec36b294085290b530d96","title":"womens six nations england ireland rugby union","story":"• Ireland 7-51 England• Red Roses begin campaign with eight triesThe Women’s Six Nations kicked off on a freezing Dublin evening but, as the mercury dropped, England’s performance rose to the occasion. A dominant pack, aggressive defence and clinical finishing by Simon Middleton’s newly-professional side overwhelmed Ireland.England know things will not be this straightforward against the grand slam champions France next weekend but, with the centre Emily Scarratt influential on her comeback, this was a perfect start. By the time Emily Scott and Bryony Cleall, both second-half replacements, went over for the seventh and eighth tries in the dying minutes England’s few supporters at Donnybrook had a very warm feeling.Scarratt’s return to XVs after two years playing sevens was a big boost for England, the centre’s almost telepathic midfield partnership with Katy Daley-Mclean so vital over the years.Scarratt soon made her mark with a midfield break after England had won swift ball from a lineout and Jess Breach found room on the right-hand touchline to touch down. The score looked ominously easy.Daley-Mclean spurned the chance of a very kickable penalty as the English pack chose to bludgeon their way over from a series of mauls. The fly-half then kept the scoreboard ticking over with a penalty from in front of the posts after the desperate Ireland defence had repelled the danger.Sarah Bern, the England prop who was also returning after a year out, made a storming break down the middle of the field and Scarratt again gave Breach a chance to create havoc down the touchline but the wing was hauled into touch. England were now moving through their gears. Hannah Botterman, their other prop, made a big carry and the ball was moved to the blindside where a clever little chip by Daley-Mclean was cleverly touched down by the full-back Sarah McKenna.Botterman, the 19-year-old Saracens tighthead, continued to cause the Irish defence problems. She made another break but the TMO this time denied Breach a second try when a replay showed she had just knocked the ball on as she was tackled by Aoife McDermott.England suffered a setback, though, when their experienced flanker Marlie Packer had to leave the field just before the break. Packer had played a big part in a dominant performance by the England pack and her absence against France would be a major blow.Bern crashed over for a try near the posts just after the break which Daley-Mclean converted. England now had a 20-point cushion and Ireland’s resistance was broken.Sarah Hunter then took the ball from a lineout and the England pack drove the hooker, Lark Davies, over for their fourth try. Ireland were unable to stem the white tide and the substitute Rowena Burnfield popped up a pass for Daley-Mclean to dart over. There was some consolation for Ireland on the hour when the England scrum buckled and they were awarded a penalty try. But Zoe Harrison ensured England had the last word. She had been on the field for barely five minutes at fly-half when she breached the Irish defence for a sixth try."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0454e25179f790b6335f6d049c3de8608c01d601/3_170_3377_2026/master/3377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=273e3b09c46e522ea9f45689376ed751","title":"ireland best game england rory best six nations rugby union","story":"• Captain dismisses Autumn internationals as ‘friendlies’• ‘We have to play at a higher level than we did in November’Signs of weakness were thin on the ground in the Ireland camp on Friday. In response to Eddie Jones’s somewhat half-hearted attempt to turn the pressure up on the Six Nations champions – “praise can make you weak” – the Ireland captain, Rory Best, quipped back: “It’s maybe the lack of praise from Joe behind closed doors that protects us.”Ireland like to talk about the “bubble” that Joe Schmidt creates. It shields them from the praise Jones referred to. And in fairness there has been a certain bullishness in Dublin this week. The former head coach Eddie O’Sullivan believes only two members of England’s side would get into Ireland’s while the former captain Brian O’Driscoll thinks Saturday’s home side will have “too many smarts” for a “shaky” England team.In a further demonstration of Ireland’s mindset, according to Best the November internationals are, in effect, friendlies and the World Cup can wait. The first of those is some claim considering Ireland’s two victories against New Zealand in their past three meetings have come during the autumn, the most recent just a few months ago. He went a step further, insisting Ireland will have to produce their most accomplished performance since Schmidt took over in 2013 – and there have been plenty – in order to beat England.In the green corner Andy FarrellTest caps 8 for England\u0026nbsp (rugby union) 34 for GB, 11 for England (rugby league)Andy on Owen (when he first joined Ireland) “As a kid I never let him beat me at anything, but since he’s turned 19 he’s beaten me at everything so it’s about time I started getting my own back.”In the white corner\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOwen FarrellTest caps 65 for England, 4 for LionsOwen on Andy “I’d grown up watching my dad at Wigan and being around a lot of people he played with – some good teams that had real good leaders in. People who wanted to win. That brought that side out of me.”“We’re going to need the best game of rugby that this group has ever played because that’s what it will take to win this weekend,” he said. “They will be physical, but they will also play with a lot of width and speed, that’s their plan. You need to get on the front foot, up front.“Six Nations rugby, it’s different to the autumn internationals. The autumn internationals is playing a team that’s a little bit unknown. Argentina and New Zealand, we study them but we don’t play against them in Europe every year. You’re not very close neighbours. England know us inside out.“And you’re into competition. None of us ever treat the autumn internationals as friendlies but, ultimately, that’s what they are. This is a competition, a championship and all of that squeezes the pressure on you and creates a different sort of atmosphere. It probably means you have to play to a higher level than we did in November.”The second of Best’s claims – that Japan 2019 is not entering their thoughts – was backed up by what he called “his worst moment in an Ireland shirt”.He said: “I remember way back to 2007 we had a really good team. We lost to France at Croke Park when we should have grand-slammed right at the very end of the game. It was almost a bit of a feeling of, ‘Oh, we’ll get them at the World Cup’, and it wasn’t. We bombed out in the groups and it was the least enjoyable time I’ve ever had in an Ireland shirt. That all came because there was an attitude of ‘it’ll be all right on the night’. That’s why you don’t look ahead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d33ddba5b34e10053d5129d4ff372bb0360d58c/0_192_4073_2444/master/4073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6cca243115a308793476fb5a02da70f","title":"france v wales six nations 2019 live","story":"Wales took advantage of extraordinary French generosity to come from 16-0 down at half-time and win on a wet, error-strewn night in ParisMichael Aylwin was at the Stade de France to watch a remarkable comeback from Wales, who beat the hapless French.

I think the conditions won the game for us today.” France’s players are devastated: And so they should be - they have thrown that game away, gifting Wales two tries with a couple of stupid mistakes from Yoann Huget and the rookie Romain Ntamack. WALES WIN! The ball goes loose, Gareth Davies claims it , turns and boots it into the stand. Wales have ridden their luck and come from 16-0 down at half-time to win the opening match of this year’s Six Nations championship. 80+1 min: France 19-24 Wales France recycle for the 13th time as Wales defend 40 metres from their own line. 80 min: France 19-24 Wales Wales lose their own line-out and Geoffrey Doumayrou tries to force his way up the line. France have the ball just inside the Welsh half as the clock goes into the red. Ntamack advances, but Tipuric makes the tackle. 80 min: France 19-24 Wales France wheel the scrum deliberately and concede a penalty, before starting a mini-brawl. Meanwhile, the clock ticks on – that’s just so French. Thirty seconds to go. 79 min: France 19-24 Wales Wales put-in at the scrum after a brilliant tackle from Jason Tipuric forces a France knock-on. There are 60 seconds remaining. 77 min: France 19-24 Wales “They were so smart tactically in the first half but it’s just disappeared in the second,” says Paul O’Connell of France on the BBC match commentary. They win a penalty after a Welsh player picks up a Gareth Davies knock-on and France kick for the corner. It’s a poor effort and they have a line-out about 10 metres from the Wales try line. 76 min: France 19-24 Wales Stout defending from Wales, as France run into brick wall after brick wall. They’re on phase 20 but haven’t made an inch. Gael Fickou concedes the scrum with a forward pass and Wales alleviate the pressure for the time being at least. 75 min: France 19-24 Wales A penalty won’t be good enough for France at this late stage, but they have possession halfway inside the Wales halfas they recycle the ball for the 14th time. Wales stand firm. WALES TRY!!! France 19-24 Wales: After two poor France passes in a row, Romain Ntamack throws a third one out wide towards the wing and it’s intercepted by George North, who hares off towards the line. That’s the second try he’s been gifted tonight. Add on two more for the conversion. FRANCE PENALTY! France 19-17 Wales Lopez puts the French ahead once again, slotting over a penalty awarded after Wales failed to get the ball out of their own scrum. That massive French pack was just too powerful for them. 69 min: France 16-17 Wales After another break for an injury to Cory Hill, France win a penalty under the Welsh posts following a period of sustained pressure. It’s under the posts.68 min: France 16-17 Wales Gareth Davies gifts possession to Romain Ntamack and France set up Lopez for a drop goal. It’s blocked brilliantly by Justin Tipiric. 67 min: France 16-17 Wales Liam Williams goes off with blood pouring from a head wound, which means he’ll probably have to get stitched up and under go a head injury assessment. Having been replaced earlier by Dan Biggar, Gareth Anscombe comes back off the bench and goes in at full-back. 65 min: France 16-17 Wales A Wales 22 drop-out, which Biggar sends as far up the pitch as he can. France return it and win the turnover and Julien Marchand surges forward. France knock on and there’ll be a break in play as Wales full-back Liam Williams receives treatment after coming out second best from a tackle by Louis Picamoles. 63 min: France 16-17 Wales Dan Biggar slots over to put Wales in front. I’m not quite sure how they’ve managed this - France have been absolutely dreadful since half-time, so the Welsh haven’t had to do anything particularly special to come from 16-0 down to take the lead in a little over 20 minutes. Let’s not forget, either, that they’ve had two tries disallowed. 61 min: France 16-14 Wales Good play from Navidi and Alun Wyn Jones, who hold up Louis Picamoles to create a maul, allowing them to win the put-in for the subsequent scrummage. Penalty advantage for Wales and Dan Biggar sets off up the pitch on what amounts to a free play. No advantage is forthcoming, so Wales have a penalty after Demba Bamba pops out of the scrum. That’s the fourth penalty the Welsh forwards have won tonight. 58 min:  France 16-14 Wales Both sides have rung the changes and brought on replacements, with Wales very much on the front foot despite having looked dead and buried at half-time. As I type that, France win a penalty, which Camille Lopez pulls wide from a long way out. They could have done with that to steady their jitters. 55 min: France 16-14 Wales It’s all Wales, as Jonathan Davies breaks a tackle to make ground the left touchline. Dan Biggar, on from the bench, drives forward and a ruck forms. The ball is played inside to Ross MOriarty, who crashes over. His “try” is subsequently disallowed for an apparent infringement on Louis Picamoles, who Ashley Barnes decides was cleared out despite not being part of the ruck formed around Biggar. On BBC, the commentary team are unanimous in their opinion that it was a harsh decision. WALES TRY!!! France 16-14 Wales A shocking error by Yohann Huget allows George North in to score a second try for Wales. The France winger was sliding back over his line to collect a terrible kick for the corner, but let the wet ball squirt out from under his arm and into play. He can only watch in horror as George North comes from nowhere to perform an excellent pick-up and touch down for what amounts to a gift. Anscombe snaffles the two points from the conversion. There’s only two points in it! 49 min: France 16-7 Wales The Wales fans in the stands find their voice having seen their side score. A French knock-on gives Wales a scrum just inside the France half. WALES TRY!!! France 16-7 Wales Wales go through the phases – 10 of them – and score a try out of nothing. A missed tackle by Paul Willemse allows Josh Adams to break through the defensive line and he draws a man before passing to Tomas Williams, who slides over. Anscombe slots over for the extra two points. 43 min: France 16-0 Wales France continue to slow down the game at every opportunity and after a re-set, Louis Picamoles takes the ball out of a spinning scrum. 41 min: France 16-0 Wales A good tackle on Camille Lopez by Tomas Williams forces an error, giving Wales the put-in in the scrum in the middle of the pitch. Gareth Anscombe wriggles past Morgan Parra to get to the France 22. Wales over-run the ball and Ken Owens mishandles. Yet another handling error for Wales - their 12th. France have the scrum on their own 22. 41 min: France get the ball airborne for the second half as the rain continues to bucket down. Josh Adams claims for Wales. Half-time stat: “The last time Wales were at least 16 points behind at half-time was over two years ago when they were losing 20-3 in Australia, in a match they lost 32-8,” writes our man in the Gracenote Sports anorak, Simon Gleave. “It is nearly 3 years since Wales were so far behind at the break of a Six Nations match (0-16 v England in 2016). Wales recovered in the second half to lose 25-21. This was also the last time they failed to score a first half point.”Wales go in for the interval with their tails between their legs and fairly lucky to be only 16 points behind. They’ve missed 11 tackles to France’s five and committed eight handling errors to France’s one. The French flew out of the traps, while their opponents have yet to find any kind of momentum at all. DROP GOAL!!! France 16-0 Wales: Anscombe’s decision to keep the ball in play costs them dearly, as France set up a drop goal effort from distance for Camille Lopez. He makes no mistake, turning away and fist-pumping excitedly as Wayne Barnes signals half-time. Wales are in all sorts of bother here and haven’t a hope of getting anything from this match unless they seriously up their game. 40 min: France 13-0 Wales: Wales get a free-kick for a premature French push in the scrum. Anscombe kicks towards the centre, keeping the ball on the pitch. The clock ticks into the red and we’re in first-half overtime. 39 min: France 13-0 Wales: Stout defending from Wales on their own line as they attempt to repel a French maul that was snowballing as assorted members of their backline got involved. A five-metre scrum and Wales have the put-in. 38 min: France 13-0 Wales: Josh Navidi is penalised for tackling Morgan Parra before the scrum-half had a chance to release the ball from a line-out. Parra kicks for the corner and Arthur Iturria claims the ball at the subsequent line-out. 36 min: France 13-0 Wales: Wales win a line-out halfway inside the France half. Ken Owens takes the throw-in but fails to find his man. It’s just one mistake after another from the Welsh.

But only one wicket has fallen, and the runs have still flowed fast enough, with 90 runs on the board. Patterson can have some early thoughts of a Test century, if he dares, while Paine also has a great chance for a decent score after the break. There’s a huge amount of time left in the game, there’s a sell-out crowd filling Manuka, it’s a gentle cool and cloudy day, and so there’s no reason for Australia to do anything but bat and bat and bat.That’s it from me – I’ll be back tomorrow, and coming up next will be Adam Collins. Kindly address your correspondence accordingly.118th over: Australia 474-5 (Patterson 74, Paine 28) Rajitha to Paine, who works a single. Patterson waits out the rest, including another no-ball.“Was Kurtis Patterson the player who came out to field for New South Wales with a toasted sandwich in his pocket?” asks Brett Sprigg on ABC Grandstand. “It’s strange what stays in your memory.”“Why not?” responds Dirk Nannes. “You can have whatever you like in your pockets.”“That might not be the best suggestion,” says Sprigg eventually. “After the last ten months or so.”For the record, let it show that the toastie belonged to Nic Maddinson. And appropriately, it’s time for lunch.117th over: Australia 472-5 (Patterson 74, Paine 27) Gorgeous. Threads the gap between cover and mid-off, as Kusal Perera es and can’t save. Dilruwan Perera the bowler. Most of Patterson’s boundaries have come from the short ball, and that was easily his best from a fuller pitch. Is he thinking about a hundred yet?114th over: Australia 468-5 (Patterson 70, Paine 27) Rajitha is back, he’s been Sri Lanka’s best today by a mile. And he nearly bags Patterson straight up. Leading edge that drops short of midwicket. Minor victory for the bowler. But Patterson takes back the ascendancy by smashing a pull shot for four, just beating midwicket who es, but the ball flies away to the rope.113th over: Australia 462-5 (Patterson 64, Paine 27) Paine gets a leg bye, after which Patterson charges de Silva and plonks him through cover for four. I’m not sure if that was supposed to be a high loft or along the ground, but he mis-hit it and split the difference, at a catchable height but in the gap. The partnership is worth 58.112th over: Australia 457-5 (Patterson 60, Paine 27) Paine getting very cautious, including just padding a Perera delivery away. Old school. Gets a single to close the over.Phillip Lewis emails in: “Whilst reading Steve Smith’s Men I’m reminded of a question I was asking myself in the immediate aftermath of the ball tampering fiasco. Who tipped off the South African TV people? Was it an eagle-eyed doorman? Were the change rooms bugged? How, in short, did anyone other than the suspended culprits know?”And to answer his question, the South African players had a pretty fair suspicion that there was something unorthodox going on. The broadcasters did the investigative work.111th over: Australia 456-5 (Patterson 60, Paine 26) Double spin, perhaps, as Dhananjaya de Silva comes on from the Church End. He bowls serviceable part-time off-spin. Patterson cuts a couple and drops a single. Paine gives the strike back thanks to a fumble at mid on.110th over: Australia 452-5 (Patterson 57, Paine 25) Patterson with the hit-and-run to mid off once more, taking the quick singles well. That’s the only score from the over.109th over: Australia 451-5 (Patterson 56, Paine 25) Karunaratne lobs the ball from hand to hand, like a clubbie pretending he’s about to come in and bowl a ripping leg-break before sending down a slow doorknob. When he bowls too full, Paine produces the best shot of his innings. The square drive looked risky, but this on-drive is perfect. A picture. Put it on a postcard. The 450 comes up. 108th over: Australia 447-5 (Patterson 56, Paine 21) Paine drives Perera to mid on a couple of times before taking on the man for a single. The only score from the over, but Perera is four runs away from his bowling ton.107th over: Australia 446-5 (Patterson 56, Paine 20) Karunaratne, from the Church End now although he bowled at the Pool End earlier. Paine tries to repeat the slashing square drive from earlier but this ball doesn’t get up enough, and it creeps under his stroke. When the bowler goes back of a length, Paine is able to force square off the back foot and pick up three out to deep cover. Patterson drives a couple through mid on from a very overpitched delivery. So Karunaratne follows up with one just as full but wider, and Patterson drives it cleanly through point for four. A productive over, worth nine.106th over: Australia 437-5 (Patterson 50, Paine 17) Now it’s Patterson’s turn to find the field, as Perera keeps dropping short but isn’t punished. Hasn’t bowled with much rhythm. “One maiden in his spell, that says it all for me,” observes fellow off-spinner Phil Tufnell on ABC radio. Make that two maidens now, but the second wasn’t a quality one. 105th over: Australia 437-5 (Patterson 50, Paine 17) Chamika Karunaratne comes into the attack for Fernando. Patterson glances a single for his milestone, and celebrates in very understated fashion. Paine plays plenty of shots to the next five balls, but finds the field every time. 104th over: Australia 436-5 (Patterson 49, Paine 17) Behind the pace here as the Canberra internet and phone networks combine to black out the blog – apologies. Dilrurwan bowls a mostly pretty good over, but Patterson produces a quality on-drive away through midwicket for three, which is saved at the rope.103rd over: Australia 433-5 (Patterson 46, Paine 17) Fernando to Paine, who drops a single away to the leg side and scurries through. Patterson goes more firmly in the same direction for another. This gives you a sense of the Patterson approach.102nd over: Australia 431-5 (Patterson 45, Paine 16) We’ve had a drinks break and now Dilruwan Perera resumes from the Pool End. A tidy sort of over, met by some tidy defence from Patterson. Some variety from the batsman, happy to use his long reach and also to use his feet to defend.101st over: Australia 431-5 (Patterson 45, Paine 16) Patterson is a long and bendy batsman, and his gangles are all on display as he pulls a single from Vishwa Fernando. Paine likewise pulls and scores a couple of runs.“Do you think Paine will eye a ton here,” asks Ruth Purdue on email. He can eye one, just like I can eye an Aston Martin through the showroom window. But he hasn’t made a first-class ton since 2006, so the likelihood doesn’t seem high. Certainly hope he can do it before his second-chance career is over.100th over: Australia 428-5 (Patterson 44, Paine 14) Dilruwan Perera comes on to try some off-breaks, bowling from the Swimming Pool End rather than the Church End where he was yesterday. Paine tries to shovel a couple across his stumps before he gets a single away. Patterson drives to mid-on and sets off with the shot, bolting through as the stumps get thrown down. He was in comfortably but the umpire goes upstairs anyway. Not out: his foot was well in, let alone his bat.99th over: Australia 426-5 (Patterson 43, Paine 13) Fernando to Paine, left-arm over the wicket, and Paine drives beautifully down the ground for four! Just inside the mid-off fieldsman, who is set quite wide, and it beat his e. Paine usually likes to get on with the game, though he has played some long innings for Australia since coming back into the side nearly 18 months ago. Picks up another brace through the gully. Then a leg bye.98th over: Australia 419-5 (Patterson 43, Paine 7) Karunaratne to Patterson bowls most of a good over, angling across the lefty just outside the off stump. But when he tries the bouncer Patterson is more than equal to it, pulling behind square and beating the squarer sweeper into the fence. It’s a no-ball too, yet another overstep for the Sri Lankan attack.97th over: Australia 414-5 (Patterson 39, Paine 7) That’s a bit more convincing from Paine. Fuller and wide from Rajitha and Paine throws a square drive at it. Nails it for four. Rajitha gets a ball to come into the pads and nearly squeaks through, but Paine gets bat there. Then a tester back of a length that got enough bat that it didn’t constitute an outside edge. But we’ve seen some decent stuff from Rajitha this morning. 96th over: Australia 410-5 (Patterson 39, Paine 3) Karunaratne – the bowler, not the batsman – comes on. Short and stocky but wheels the ball down alright. Tim Paine won’t get many better chances than this to make some runs. But he nearly spurns that with a wild cut shot that misses but nearly gives up a top edge. He gets going with a push down the ground for three runs. 95th over: Australia 407-5 (Patterson 39, Paine 0) Rajitha nearly gets another with the chop-on. Patterson stands up tall and gets a bottom edge trying to force away away to the off side. The ball lands kindly for him. Gets a couple of runs on the leg glance.94th over: Australia 405-5 (Patterson 37, Paine 0) Patterson is unflustered, and keeps collecting singles. Paine tries to block out Fernando’s over, though he misses one and is reprieved by the umpire. Outside leg stump perhaps from the left-armer? 93rd over: Australia 404-5 (Patterson 36, Paine 0) Well, it’s a busy old over from Rajitha. He gets belted by Patterson’s pull shot for four, from a no-ball, and then gives Burns another boundary off the legs. Australia’s 400 comes up. But then Rajitha gets some fortune his way with the wicket. On balance, he’s bowled a few great deliveries and probably deserved some luck. Here comes Paine, blocking out his first ball.Oh, that’s bad luck! But Burns has had plenty of good luck in this knock to this point. Burns is out to the pleave: he half played at this ball well outside off, then wanted to bail out. Left the bat hanging out, the ball comes off the face and bounces down onto his stump. Burns is gone for his best Test score of 180, and his fourth Test century. Three of them have been over 150. He’s got something, as we’ve all known for a while. Quite why he hasn’t been in the team between now and Johannesburg last year is the enduring mystery. Safe to say he’s back, even as he goes.92nd over: Australia 394-4 (Burns 176, Patterson 31) Burns gets going with his first Queensland shot of the morning, getting up tall for a meaty cut through the covers. Only gets two as the outfield is a touch slow and he didn’t time it perfectly. Fernando follows up by beating his edge with a good one. There’s been something for the bowlers in this early passage, but as we saw yesterday, if you don’t make the most of that you can be in some serious toil.91st over: Australia 392-4 (Burns 174, Patterson 31) Burns nudges another single, creeping towards that double-century. Patterson edges Rajitha, the second stroke of bad luck for the bowler, as it angles down past gully on the bounce, false shot from an uncontrolled poke. Patterson has a new highest score, following his 30 on debut in Brisbane. If he can keep this trend up in each innings he’ll have a fair record by his 100th Test.“The first bear would be the vanguard. What sort of bears are they? Cuddly and cute or fierce and growly?” I don’t know where you went to school, Andrew Benton, but the vanguard is looking after the escape vehicle.90th over: Australia 387-4 (Burns 173, Patterson 27) Fernando to Patterson, trying to do the disciplined thing and just work away in the channel outside the left-hander’s off stump. Patterson counters with the other disciplined thing and leaves it all. Discipline fight. 89th over: Australia 387-4 (Burns 173, Patterson 27) Kasun Rajitha from the Church End, directly in front of us here in the media centre. Some swing for him immediately. Patterson works a single, but Burns is beaten by an absolute beauty. That was aimed at middle stump so Burns came slightly across the ball. Then it swung away, beat his outside edge, and just, just crept over the off bail. Cruel for a bowler. 88th over: Australia 386-4 (Burns 173, Patterson 26) Vishwa Fernando will do the honours with the still new-ish ball. Gets Burns on the pad, and Dickwella immediately launches into his Starman appeal, singing Bowie all the while. But Umpire Illingworth’s mind is not blown. You can tell why it’s not out, because the ricochet is given as a run, not a leg bye. Patterson also gets moving immediately with a run into the covers.Great Southern Land gets a run on the PA for the 1,000,486th time at an Australian cricket match. Iva Davies stirs in his slumber and rolls over on his piles of diamonds and gold.Ten minutes to go. Tim Paine has been in the nets. Got a first-baller at the Gabba, so he’d want to finish his season on a slightly higher personal note...One former Australia player is briefly back in the ABC comm box and also apparently back in the team huddle.Now then, if you’re feeling down for any reason this morning, be cheered up by this. Hope is a bird... Graeme Vimpani!A brief thought on the Burns-Head partnership. It wrapped up yesterday at 308, meaning it was the biggest partnership since Shaun Marsh and Adam Voges towelled up a sorry West Indies team in Hobart back in 2015. That day Voges and Marsh nearly broke the all-time Australian partnership record of 451, Marsh eventually falling with the stand worth 459. So, 2015. You read that and think that it’s been a while. But then if you dig a little deeper on the numbers, there have only been 22 Australian stands worth over 300 in history. Ever. Of those 22, Bradman featured in five of them. Because of course he did. But he also featured in the first, in 1934. The first 60 years of Test cricket didn’t feature a single stand that big. Then there was a gap of 17 years between Bradman’s last and Bill Lawry’s first of two, then 20 more years before the next featuring another Marsh and Mark Taylor.The great Australian Waugh-Ponting era only produced four 300 stands between 1999 and 2006. They don’t come along very often, regardless of the conditions or situation. So while people can qualify that this came against a weak Sri Lankan attack, assembling a score of this magnitude between two batsmen is still a rare achievement.

Hello also to anyone in orbit who has managed to access the uplink. (And watch out for the supercomputer, it’s slowly going mad!) Australia will resume today in Canberra in a dominant position with the bat for the first time this home season, and indeed the first time in just under a year, since the Durban Test at the start of March 2018. The score is 384 for 4, a fair old recovery from 28 for 3, which was the position after a first hour of sloppy shots against pretty average bowling from an entirely new Sri Lankan seam attack forced by injury to all three bowlers who played in Brisbane.Travis Head made 161, while Joe Burns can go really big when he resumes on 172 not out. Both were dropped earlier in their innings, as was Kurtis Patterson first ball who resumes on 25. Let’s just say that Sri Lanka haven’t helped themselves.Head last night dedicated his hundred to another aggressive and unorthodox left-hander, the late Phillip Hughes, who mentored the younger player after moving to play for South Australia. It was an emotional moment in the middle. “I just wanted to hug him as hard as I could for as long as I could,” said the adorable Burns last night. If you couldn’t love him any more.In other news that is unfortunately news, the teenage prodigy Will Pucovski has asked to be released from the squad to head home and keep managing his mental health. It’s hard enough for any of us to do that, let alone when it’s being reported on in news outlets. But that’s the peril of high-profile work. So let’s hope people can do the right thing and leave him alone.We’ll get going in just under an hour, on another cool and cloudy day in Canberra."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32eb4f30fd4e021253a2e12a5189ceed9a2b1e2d/763_575_3605_2163/master/3605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbacf37f8ab8cdb1f2f8fae5782f1a29","title":"closure google plus everything you need to know","story":"Social network’s demise has confused many Google users.

The news website Snopes announced on Friday it was cutting ties with the social network.The departure of Snopes, which has collaborated with Facebook for two years to debunk misinformation on the platform, doesn’t come as a surprise. Numerous journalists working for Facebook’s factchecking initiative have said the partnership was failing to have an impact.Snopes, which was paid by Facebook, announced in a short post that it had been evaluating the ramifications and costs of providing third-party factchecking services. “We want to determine with certainty that our efforts to aid any particular platform are a net positive for our online community, publication and staff,” it said.Facebook’s factchecking collaboration with various newsrooms began after the 2016 presidential election led to significant concerns about propaganda and false news polluting the site. Facebook has since experimented with different tools to stop the spread of misinformation, including limiting the reach of articles debunked by journalist partners.Studies and analyses of the initiative have repeatedly raised questions about whether the partnership was making a difference, and Facebook has refused to release meaningful data. Over the last year, journalists also increasingly raised ethical concerns about accepting money from the scandal-scarred company. Some critics said the financial arrangement compromised newsrooms that report on Facebook.“This all could have been avoided if they had not taken money from Facebook to begin with,” Brooke Binkowski, former managing editor of Snopes, told the  on Friday. Binkowski has long been outspoken against the partnership and while at Snopes advocated against it. Facebook paid Snopes $100,000 in 2017.“It was a huge conflict of interest,” Binkowski said, adding: “You cannot speak truth to power if you’re being paid directly by power … We cannot pressure Facebook for transparency if we’re their employees.”ABC News, another initial partner in the program, was an early US newsroom to drop out. The Weekly Standard, which joined in 2017, recently shut down.PolitiFact and FactCheck.org remain a part of the initiative in the US, and Facebook continues to work with more than 30 news outlets across the globe. A recent survey of the partners estimated that factcheckers may have debunked a total of more than 30,000 links to false content as part of the partnership, but many of the newsrooms reported they were uncertain whether the work had helped reduce the reach of viral hoaxes.A Facebook spokesperson said Friday that factchecking partners now review content in 16 languages and that it plans to expand the program this year.“We value the work that Snopes has done, and respect their decision as an independent business. Fighting misinformation takes a multi-pronged approach from across the industry. We are committed to fighting this through many tactics, and the work that third-party fact-checkers do is a valued and important piece of this effort,” Facebook said in a statement.Snopes did not respond to requests for comment, but its managing editor, Doreen Marchionni, told Poynter that factcheckers had raised concerns about the partnership on multiple occasions. Snopes’ announcement said it was not ruling out working with Facebook in the future.Political propaganda remains a significant problem on social media. Facebook and Twitter announced on Thursday that they had taken down hundreds of accounts with suspected links to influence operations from Iran, Russia and Venezuela."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/120feb54af80fe9103f475596c4a70658a2482b6/0_7_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db48297066af902a4485dc3b95cab2d1","title":"polar vortex 2019 america latest news cold temperatures","story":"The bitter cold gripping the American east and midwest, blamed for claiming at least two dozen lives so far, is expected to turn into spring-like weather by early next week, according to forecasters.Just days after arctic conditions, temperatures are expected to climb by as much as 80 degrees Fahrenheit in some regions. Experts said the rapid thaw is unprecedented, and could create its own problems – bursting pipes, flooding rivers and crumbling roads.Already, the blast of cold air known as the polar vortex has been blamed for killing at least two dozen people, including a man found frozen in his backyard in a Milwaukee suburb on Thursday. Dozens of others were sent to hospitals in the region.In Illinois alone, hospitals reported more than 220 cases of frostbite and hypothermia since Tuesday.The weather was caused by a blast of cold air from the North Pole being pushed south into North America. That made some parts of Illinois colder than Antarctica on Wednesday, and the windchill factor made Los Angeles feel as much as 100 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than some parts of the midwest.Many places remained painfully cold on Thursday, including in western New York, where a storm brought face-stinging winds, sub-zero temperatures and up to 20in (51cm) of snow in some places. In New York City, about 200 firefighters battling a blaze in a commercial building took turns getting warm on buses.Attorneys for inmates said hundreds at the politan detention center in Brooklyn had spent days in cold, dark cells amid the frigid weather. They said all recreational activities as well as visits from lawyers and family members had been canceled.However, places such as Rockford, Illinois, where the mercury dropped to a record-setting -31F (-35C) on Thursday morning, should warm to 50F (10C) by Monday.The dramatic warm-up will offer respite from the bone-chilling cold which canceled school, closed businesses and halted trains. However, the same cycle could crack water mains, homeowners pipes and reveal potholes in roads. Scores of vehicles will be left with flat tires and bent rims.Masters, from Weather Underground, said the polar vortex was “rotating up into Canada” and not expected to return in the next couple of weeks. If it does return in late February, “it won’t be as intense.”Amid the dangerous and gruelingly chilly conditions, Americans, by legend, will supposedly find out on 2 February, whether winter will last for another six weeks or whether spring will blossom early.It is Groundhog Day, forever immortalized in the film starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. The most famous ceremony on the day takes place in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, when men in top hats and formal dress hold a reluctant, captive woodchuck, perpetually known as Punxsutawney Phil, aloft at sunrise.If there is enough sunshine for the mammal to “see his shadow”, it will be a long winter. If not, spring is well on the way.The forecast in that part of Pennsylvania tomorrow is for chilly, but not freezing, temperatures, with sun and clouds. Ditto in New York City, where a distant rival to Phil, Staten Island Chuck, will be similarly ritualized.A new aspiring member of the woodchuck hall of fame is the Milwaukee County Zoo’s groundhog, or woodchuck, Gordy. The weather forecast for that part of Wisconsin is cloudy, so locals can look forward to exiting the deep freeze sooner than the east coast, perhaps. It’s forecast to be mild and damp in Atlanta, Georgia, for the Super Bowl on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b0551189c04cc291fcb7d049e4059f7ac79b674/13_481_3036_1821/master/3036.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83e62b419389a57248406d5bbaeedd5f","title":"african churches boom london backstreets a picture essay","story":"In 20th century Britain, migrants from Nigeria and Ghana founded churches to build communities, as did the Caribbean peoples before them in the 1940s and 1950sby Simon Dawson  Reuters. Words by William SchombergAfrican churches opened their doors in London from the 1960s, followed by a second wave in the 1980s. Migrants, many of them from Nigeria and Ghana, sought to build communities and maintain cultural connections with their home countries by founding their own churches, often in private homes, schools and office spaces.On a cold, grey Sunday morning, in a street lined with shuttered builders’ yards and storage units, songs of prayer in the West African language of Yoruba ring out from a former warehouse that is now a church. The congregation, almost entirely dressed in white robes, steadily grows to around 70 people as musicians playing drums, a keyboard and a guitar pick up the pace of the hymns. Some women prostrate themselves on the floor in prayer. In the sparse formerly industrial building, its interior brightened by touches of gold paint, a speaker reminds the group of a list of banned activities – no smoking, no drinking of alcohol, no practicing of black magic.In a street outside, a pastor flicks holy water over the car of a woman who wants a blessing to ward off the risk of accidents. The busy scene at the Celestial Church of Christ is repeated at a half a dozen other African Christian temples on the same drab street and in the adjacent roads – one corner of the thriving African church community in south London.Around 250 black majority churches are believed to operate in the borough of Southwark, where 16 percent of the population identifies as having African ethnicity.  Southwark represents the biggest concentration of African Christians in the world outside the continent with an more than 20,000 congregants attending new black majority churches each Sunday, according to research conducted in 2013 by the University of Roehampton.Reflecting the different waves of migration to Britain in the 20th Century, these African places of worship followed the Caribbean churches that appeared in the late 1940s and 1950s as workers and their families arrived from Jamaica and other former British colonies.As the African communities grew, the churches moved into bigger spaces in bingo halls, cinemas and warehouses, gathering congregations of up to 500 people where services are streamed online by volunteers with video cameras.There is a striking contrast with the empty pews at many traditional Church of England churches where congregations have dwindled for years.“We pray for this country,” said Abosede Ajibade, a 54-year-old Nigerian who moved to Britain in 2002 and works for an office maintenance company.“People here brought Christianity to Africa but it doesn’t feel like they serve Jesus Christ any more.”Anyone travelling through south London on a Sunday morning will see worshippers, often dressed in dazzlingly coloured African clothes, making their way to churches, each with their different styles of worship.Hymns are sung only in African languages in some temples, or only in English at others. Some pastors arrange for worshippers to take full immersion baptisms in the cold of the English Channel. Others believe that when congregants suddenly start speaking in unknown languages it marks the presence of the Holy Spirit.The research by the University of Roehampton found that many churches have in common a drive for professional advancement, a commitment to spend three hours or more at Sunday service and typically very loud worship.“That is how we express our joy and gratitude to God,” Andrew Adeleke, a senior pastor at the House of Praise, one of the biggest African churches in Southwark, in a former theatre.“The church is not supposed to be a graveyard,” Adeleke said. “It is supposed to be a temple of celebration and worship and the beauty is to be able to express our love to God, even when things are not perfect in our lives.”For some, the noise from amplified services is a problem, leading to complaints to local authorities from residents. But many churches face bigger challenges than unhappy neighbours: some provide food for people struggling to make ends meet, or work with young people at risk of recruitment by gangs.Andrew Rogers, senior lecturer in Practical Theology at the University and author of the research paper, Being Built Together,, said pastors had to juggle retaining the churches African identity while appealing to children of first generation immigrants, many of whom have never lived outside Britain. They typically have a more liberal world view which can be hard to reconcile with conservative Pentecostal teachings.Rogers recalled speaking to one pastor who lamented he was unable to talk about religious miracles to his children.“If the church doesn’t adapt, then they are going to leave and look elsewhere,” Rogers said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09d32b6cd960017677be155fc99320c7dcc6b58b/0_0_5306_3185/master/5306.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e210304fa4dd5f3bcd0472a85a75b3eb","title":"sabine weyand profile eu brexit negotiator british sense humour","story":"Weyand, who this week shot down UK hopes of reopening talks, has a reputation for being ‘direct, quick, with no bullshit’MPs voted this week to send Theresa May back to Brussels to restart Brexit talks, but the Commons apparently missed the message delivered in crisp English one day earlier: the talks were over.The messenger was the EU’s deputy Brexit negotiator, Sabine Weyand: the German official with a British sense of humour who loves Shakespeare comedies and Harry Potter, and has been known to describe any outlandish idea as “bollocks”.Whether she has uttered that word since the UK embarked on its Brexit odyssey nearly two years ago with the triggering of article 50 is not clear.But Weyand is credited with coining some of the most memorable put-downs of the talks: British plans were dismissed as “unicorns” and “magical thinking”, before being chucked into the Brussels dustbin. Above all, Weyand is the architect of the Brexit deal: her fingerprints are on all 585 pages of the withdrawal agreement that MPs rejected last month.She has been in the Brexit engine room from the start, but it was her rare public speech on Monday that put her in the spotlight. News reports blazed with her punchy one-liners, evening bulletins reported her no-deal warnings, and the commentariat parsed the significance of her yellow jumper and chunky necklace.“Such a contrast between EU negotiator Sabine Weyand – fluent, detail rich, serious, knowledgeable – and the succession of defiantly ignorant Tory MPs spouting their slogans,” tweeted the former Labour spin doctor and ‘people’s vote’ supporter Alastair Campbell.Born in the West German state of Saarland in 1964, Weyand studied politics and gained a PhD in EU transport policy. She graduated top of her class of 90 students at the College of Europe, the elite training ground for EU civil servants. “She was a brilliant student,” recalls her PhD supervisor, Prof Rudolf Hrbek, who suggested she embark on an academic career. Weyand, who speaks French as well as English, had already set her sights on Brussels.Before getting to know the arcana of international trade law, there was a one-year interlude in Cambridge where she studied political philosophy and English literature. She is a voracious reader, who loves Thomas Hardy and Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew and Much Ado About Nothing. As a student she analysed the role of the forest in the Bard’s works.In the dense thicket of Brexit, she is reputed as a formidable operator. “I would really not want to be on the opposite side of the negotiating table,” one EU diplomat said. Admirers praise her astute handling of the competing egos of the EU institutions.“She is a rare breed. So many officials can either do the big waffle or they can do the minutiae of article 6 paragraph whatever. What she can do is grasp the technical detail and the political interplay,” said one EU official close to Weyand.“She has got a real affection for and understanding of the UK,” said another EU official who knows her well. Several say she has a very British sense of humour, with a taste for sarcasm and irony. “She is really fun to work with very direct, very quick, no bullshit,” said the official. Over the course of 25 years in Brussels, in which she has also worked on climate, energy and development, she bumped into many who would later play a role in the Brexit drama. One senior official at the Department for Exiting the EU, Alex Ellis, was a close colleague in Brussels. It is not the only example where UK and EU officials, once colleagues, have found themselves on the opposite side of the Brexit ide.Weyand is credited as being behind the EU’s policy of publishing many Brexit documents, a decision shaped by the public backlash against trade deals and accusations that food or environmental standards had been bartered away in secret. Critics say the transparency policy does not go far enough. The EU ombudsman reproached the European commission for not publishing an “essential” document on the Irish border or revealing details of Weyand’s meetings – a rare blot of criticism inside Brussels.The lights of transparency were also switched off when negotiators entered the “tunnel” last autumn, an intense phase of talks when the treaty text was thrashed out over long days and late nights. Before the information blackout began, Weyand told EU ambassadors to trust her to protect their interests. The member states agreed, giving her space to agree a big concession to the UK on the Irish backstop.Insiders say it could not have been done without the absolute trust between Weyand and her opposite number, Olly Robbins, the steely civil servant regarded as Theresa’s May’s Brexit brain. But Britain’s Brexit fate is now out of their hands. The final act will be decided by politicians on both sides of the Channel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b743f908aecd150d8496a6956623e50614cdc4f/0_91_3347_2008/master/3347.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78de189d62a2f759f8aa9147456af4f9","title":"vatican remains not two girls disappeared 1983 ancient","story":"Families question how experts did not immediately recognise remains were ancientHuman remains found at property in Rome owned by the Vatican belonged to an ancient Roman man and not to either of two teenage girls missing since the early 1980s, authorities have said.The discovery of the remains in October raised hopes of a breakthrough in the cases of Mirella Gregori and Emanuela Orlandi, both of whom were 15 when they disappeared within weeks of each other in 1983.Mirella was last seen on 7 May after telling her mother she had a date, and Emanuela on 22 June as she left for a music class.Initial reports suggested tests on the remains showed they were those of a woman. There was speculation that they could be the remains of two people, after an almost complete skeleton was found in one area and bone fragments in another.But investigators closed the case on Friday, saying the remains belonged to a man who died of natural causes between AD90 and AD230.The discovery of the remains, made during restoration work of a floor of a building annexed to the Vatican’s embassy, had given the girls’ families hope of finally knowing what happened to the them.The first report came from the Italian news agency Ansa, which cited a Vatican source as saying the remains could belong to Emanuela. “The source wasn’t invented,” Emanuela’s brother Pietro Orlandi told the . “He went to the site and said the remains could be Emanuela.”Antonietta Gregori, Mirella’s sister, said: “We were hoping to bring an end to this dramatic story after 35 years.”The families are now bewildered as to how experts were unable to immediately recognise that the remains were ancient. Orlandi said: “Straight away they said the remains were well maintained and recent. Now they say they are 2,000 years old.”Laura Sgrò, the lawyer representing the Orlandi family, said: “We don’t understand how they could have made so many speculations, also because so many experts in the field say you can immediately identify extremely old remains by their colour. It’s crazy and has caused the family so much pain.

Photograph: Finbarr O’RourkeThe Government may postpone the implementation of a major plan to tackle climate change in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Ministers this week discussed the prospect of pausing the initiative, which aims to make Ireland a world leader in reducing carbon emissions.Minister for Climate Action and the Environment Richard Bruton received Cabinet approval last November to proceed with a scheme that will make every Government department and State agency adopt and implement specific actions and targets in their own areas. Mr Bruton updated the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure on Thursday on its progress, with a final report expected by the end of March.It was discussed at the meeting that, while work would continue on drafting the plan, it could be “paused” if there is a no-deal Brexit, according to sources. Its implementation would continue as envisaged if there is an orderly Brexit.Those present included Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed, Minister for Transport Shane Ross, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy. The vast majority of the Government’s time after March, it was argued by one source, would be taken up with dealing with the ramifications of the UK crashing out of the EU, if such a scenario arises. However, it is not known how long a pause on Mr Bruton’s plan would last.Another source said there were “concerns that a big move now on climate when the farmers are facing a potential Brexit apocalypse mightn’t be the wisest thing politically”. The Irish Farmers’ Association has said 70,000 beef farmers would be put out of business if the UK imposed €1.7 billion in tariffs on Irish food imports, as the Government has forecast in a “crash-out” Brexit.Mr Creed warned Cabinet this week that the beef industry faced an existential crisis as viability would be lost should the UK impose tariffs of up to 70 per cent on imports.The agricultural sector would face a double-whammy in the event of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal at the end of March. This would be from massive import taxes on the 250,000 tonnes of beef to the UK, half of all Irish beef exports, and reduced prices from the beef displaced from the UK flooding EU markets. The Government estimates that UK tariffs would cost the Irish food industry €1.7 billion, of which the beef industry – the agricultural sector most affected by a hard Brexit – would account for €700 million.Mr Creed told EU agricultural commissioner Phil Hogan this week that the industry would require both emergency EU aid and European Commission approval to loosen state aid rules for a domestic bailout to “ride out” the impact of tariffs.A spokesperson for Mr Bruton said: “The cabinet committee agreed to establish 11 high-level interdepartmental teams which will develop actions across Government to step up Ireland’s response to climate change in a range of key areas which require action across government. “Very tight timelines were agreed for this work to be completed, so that Minister Bruton is still in a position to bring a plan to Cabinet for approval by the end of March this year.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Privacy issues are the most common source of unease among Irish peoplePlan to lead world in tackling carbon emissions may be \u0026lsquopaused\u0026rsquo if UK crashes out of EUMinister to act on any such recommendations of report into escalating costsMet \u0026Eacuteireann yellow weather warning is to remain in place until SaturdayBrexit is not the only factor behind the recent surge in applications for the harpFew significant public developments likely until votes in the Commons on February 14thBusiness committee may call ODCE as part of scrutiny of new law strengthening watchdogUS judge to rule next week on whether to extradite man accused of rape at GAA groundKatarina Barley made the comments on a visit to the Border region in north Co LouthIrish scientists say extreme weather, cold or warm, shows the evidence of climate changeMEP candidate Conor Lenihan also says he has nothing to hide in past Russia dealingsPresident Higgins pays tribute to Cork Chamber for its roleMan (27) dies in crash with lorry on N21 a second man (35) dies on minor road near BanagherBritish sense of humour hits hard border at the \u0026lsquoB\u0026rsquo word but they\u0027ll be back \u0027if we can get a visa\u0027Minister says grants should allow 4,500km of roads to be maintained or strengthenedMount Sion singers release \u0026lsquoYour Love Carries Me\u0026rsquo to raise funds for cancer researchModest 400 applicant increase reverses last year\u0026rsquos fall in applications"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3779294.1549051239!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"english rugby supporters in dublin slow to tackle brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJenny Clayton, from Yorkshire, in Temple Bar in Dublin ahead of Saturday’s Six Nations match between England and Ireland. Photograph: James Forde“Hey lads: are you over for the rugby?” The question, accompanied by our best reporter’s smile, never failed to elicit a good-natured, often humorous response from from the droves of English fans in Temple Bar who are over for Saturday’s Six Nations clash with Ireland.“And, lads, what about the Brexit thing?” Suddenly the near and middle distance is empty of rugby supporters.Then we tried a work-around: “And lads, after you are beaten, tell me how will you get back next year when the Brexit border goes up?”Thankfully the British sense of humour is still alive, although the laughter generally stops at the “B” word.Ben Hoddy, from Southampton, and his friends James Hayward, from Suffolk, and Piers Dunford, from Milton Keynes, were among a group combining the rugby and Hoddy’s stag. The three said they hadn’t wanted Britain to leave the European Union, and would be back next year “if we can get a visa” .“We are not worried, we are banking on getting it undone,” said Hayward, to hoots of laughter.So does that mean another vote on Brexit? “Hopefully,” said Hayward. The response, repeated by many in the group, was followed by a seeming determination not to get serious about Brexit on a lads’ weekend. “That was a serious conversation killer,” one of the group said as they posed for a group photograph.In Temple Bar Square the flame-haired “Flameheads” were replete with wigs and aliases. “Phil Snakehips” (later identified as Phil Eremenko) from Northampton said he and his friend “Badger Flamehead” from Nottingham had voted to leave.Apparently it was a surprise to them that their friend Peter “Snickers Flamehead” had voted to remain. Bank manager Peter Holian and his wife Laura, from Margate in Kent, were more inclined to discuss “the Brexit”. While he would have preferred if Britain had remained in the EU he would not want another vote. “That is democracy,” he said.The Temple Bar pub was heaving with rugby followers including David Sullivan and Paul French from Cardiff and Scott and Joe Clay from Leeds.“We are all embarrassed about it, very embarrassed,” said French, referring to the Welsh vote in favour of Brexit.We asked how they thought it was going to go. “Badly,” said Sullivan, while others in the group said neither Wales nor the north of England should be allowed to vote if there was a new referendum.Nearby were James Everard and Nigel Ellis from Warwickshire. Everard said if there was a no-deal Brexit “logistics is f***ed”. Ellis said he had not told anyone which way he had voted. He said he was working for a British company in Germany and knew the recruitment industry “where 80 per cent of low-skilled workers come from the EU”. They were hard workers “who turn up and work”, he said.He said British negotiators were up against the problem that there were 27 other EU countries and one Britain. “The real reason they don’t want a hard border in Ireland is terrorism,” he said. “I do not want terrorists determining what my vote is going to be. From a democratic perspective, we had a democratic vote: let’s leave.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Scott OlsonGetty ImagesThe freezing temperatures in the United States and intense heat in Australia that were witnessed this week both have their origins in climate change, according to two Irish scientists. Emeritus professor of geography at Maynooth University John Sweeney and director of the Icarus climate change unit at the college, professor Peter Thorne said it was becoming more evident that extreme weather events were linked to climate change. Prof Sweeney, who contributed to the Nobel Prize Winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says we are likely to see the evidence of climate change in every extreme weather event, across the globe. He said the amount of energy being trapped in the atmosphere was the equivalent “of one or two Hiroshima bombs per second”. All that energy was bound to have an effect on climate, he said. According to Prof Sweeney events in the upper atmosphere were causing the jet stream, which is an air flow going from west to east, to “lurch north and south”. When it lurches south it brings cold polar air further south and when it lurches north it brings warmer, tropical air further north. He said this was why extremes of cold that are now being experienced in the US can be seen to be related to extremes of hot weather like Europe experienced last summer. Prof Peter Thorne director of the Irish Climate Analysis and Research UnitS group (Icarus) at Maynooth University said the link between the heat in Australia and climate change and was easier to prove than the link between the polar vortex over the US midwest and climate change. He said the links in the evidence supporting US extreme weather event to climate change were long and complex, but he had no doubt they were valid.Parts of the US faced colder temperatures than Antarctic this week as a polar vortex saw cold air of minus 40 degrees moving in from the Midwest to New York and the east coast. In Chicago, people were warned of the dangers of getting frostbite on exposed skin as social media carried images of wet hair instantly freezing and hot water thrown in the air turning immediately to snow. Meanwhile in Australia record breaking heat saw wildfires rage and temperatures of 47 degrees were recorded Adelaide for the first time. US president Donald Trump tweeted on Monday: “In the beautiful Midwest, windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded. In coming days, expected to get even colder. People can’t last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Warming ? Please come back fast, we need you!” Shortly after the official US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration responded with a tweet of its own: “Winter storms don’t prove that global warming isn’t happening.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3779083.1549062591!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what is actually driving increased demand for irish passports","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Irish passport is ‘a representation of a real Irish person’, according to Fiona Penollar, who  heads the Passport Service.

But the majority of the extra demand is coming from the Irish at home, now able, again, to consider foreign holidays.So far, the Government sees the rise in applications from Britain positively. “That surge has illustrated that EU citizenship matters, not least to those who are at risk of losing it,” said Minister for Justice, Charlie Flanagan.Last year, Foreign Affairs’s Passport Office issued 862,415 passports and identity cards in 2018, significantly up from 779,000 passports in 2017 and 733,000 in 2016.The Irish passport is regarded as the world’s seventh most prized, according to the Henley Passport Index, because it offers visa-free travel to 184 countries around the globe.Brexit is fuelling applications from Northern Ireland, however. In 2017, there were 81,752, an increase of almost 20 per cent on 2016. Last year, it rose again, but less dramatically, to 84,855.In 2017, 81,287 people living in England, Scotland and Wales applied for an Irish passport, up 28 per cent on 2016. Last year, that number rose again – up by 22 per cent to 98,544.Half of all of the applications from people living in Northern Ireland were from first-timers but the percentage of first-timers from Britain was lower, standing at 39 per cent.Some 47 per cent of applications in 2017 from Britain came from people who were born in Ireland 37 per cent came from the children of Irish emigrants.Just 7 per cent, despite some commentary, qualified under the grandparent rule.A year previously, a breakdown showed that 55 per cent of British applications came from the Irish-born, 38 per cent were the children of emigrants. Some 4 per cent qualified under the grandparent rule.In 2008, the number of applications from Britain and the rest of the world – not including Northern Ireland – stood at 68,829. In 2009, it hit 74,187 a year later it went to 86,386.In 2011, it dropped back to 82,783, before falling over the next three years to 67,285 in 2014. Since then, however, it has risen. In 2016 – the year of the UK’s referendum – it hit 79,670. In 2017, it reached 87,471. Last year, 96,261 applied.However, a not-insignificant percentage of the increase in applications from abroad is explained by Irish emigrants seeking passports for their children – born out of Ireland after their parents were forced to emigrate after 2009.In 2008, the number of children’s applications stood at 8,434. A year later, it rose to 13,132. In 2010, it climbed to 17,069, and rose by a further 800 in 2011. A year later, children’s applications fell back to 15,222, and in 2013, to 14,887. Since 2015, the numbers have steadily risen, to 17,312 last year.Under Ireland’s rules, foreigners can apply for citizenship if a grandparent was born in Ireland or if one of their parents was an Irish citizen at the time of the applicant’s birth, even though they were not born in Ireland.Such applications have increased since 2008. They have doubled since the Brexit referendum, though, when probed, the numbers are lower than public commentary might suggest.In 2008, 6,683 applied for a place on the Foreign Births Register held by Foreign Affairs. The number fell to 5,840 in 2009 to 4,634 in 2010, before rising slightly to 4,689 in 2011.It fell back again in 2012 to 4,335, and to 4,147 in 2013, before rising to 4,385 in 2014 and to 4,421 in 2015. However, matters have changed since 2016, most likely explained by Brexit.That year, applications rose to 5,920. In 2017, it jumped sharply to 10,653, following by another significant increase last year to 12,309, according to official numbers.If the numbers of applications from people living in Britain has increased steadily over the past few years, the situation for those living in the United States is more nuanced.Numbers from there have oscillated since 2008. Then, 13,943 passports were issued to people living there under all categories: renewals, the children of Irish emigrants and grandparent-rule applicants.Thereafter, numbers shifted up and down between 11,000 and 12,000 until 2015 when it rose to 13,484, of whom 7,328 were the descendants of long-ago emigrants.A year later, the US numbers rose to 16,148, including 9,257 grandparent-rule applications in 2017, it rose to 19,358, but the number seeking to qualify under the grandparent rule jumped sharply to 11,727.Last year, however, the flow abated somewhat. In all, there were 14,579 applications from the US for new passports, renewals, including 8,900 under the descendants rule.Taking a calm view of the rise, Fiona Penollar, who now heads the Passport Service, said the increased popularity of the Irish passport was only partially driven by Brexit fears.Instead, more Irish people, having recovered from the economic crash, are going on foreign holidays: “You would see more people who let their passport lapse for a few years and now the whole family are applying.”Meanwhile, the figures are being skewed, too, since the change to biometric passports in the mid-2000s means many people are also due a passport renewal, Penollar told The .“The percentage increase for applications from Great Britain and Northern Ireland are actually but a small fraction. The driver of the increase is within Ireland.”Numerically, Brexit is not “having a huge impact”, she argues, though the debate about its ramifications has encouraged many in Ireland to place more value on the document.Rising numbers has not caused delays, she insists, helped by online applications, with passports arriving within 10 working days. However, more staff have been hired.The increasing popularity of the passport for people living in Britain is not tied to any emotional connection with Ireland, says Prof Mary Gilmartin from Maynooth University.Faced with the threat of future EU travel restrictions and uncertainty around their status in the UK, those with a claim to Irish citizenship there are “strategically choosing security”, she says.In her 2018 paper, Irish Enough: Changing narratives of citizenship and national identity in the context of Brexit, Gilmartin argued that Brexit has both “opened up and closed off” the different meanings of Irishness while reshaping the “meaning and utility of Irish citizenship” for British people.Since the 2004 citizenship referendum, Irish citizenship is granted to children born in Ireland only if one parent is an Irish citizen, or entitled to citizenship, at the time of their birth.Citizenship is not awarded to children born in Ireland to non-Irish citizens – rules that have created a system of rights that “primarily favoured ancestry over residence”, she writes.“That’s the fundamental problem in how we understand citizenship,” says Gilmartin, “Who we think of as Irish isn’t necessarily who gets formally recognised as Irish.”Ireland does not offer quick citizenship for wealthy investors, unlike countries such as Malta and Cyprus. But five-year residency visas are available to those investing more than €2 million. Afterwards, they can apply for Irish citizenship.Michael Parker, managing director of Insight Communications, opposes passports-for-investment citizenship schemes: “Our passport has always been seen as neutral and Irish citizenship is a very valuable thing.“But if someone wants to come and set up a business, they have to go through the same system of qualifications as anyone else,” says Parker, who has worked with Indians interested in the residency visa offering.“The Government has made it very clear that citizenship isn’t on the table. You can sell residency or an ability to work and live here I think that’s a good scheme for the country. Not an automatic route to a passport.”Arguing that the generally understood definition of “Irishness” is changing, Fiona Penollar says the designs and poetry currently decorating the Irish passport recognise the different cultures existing among citizens.“It’s literally that being Irish is not about a place or a look, it’s about a feeling and, of course, about having citizenship. Ireland is a changing word and being Irish is a changing thing.“That’s brilliant, it’s alive and vibrant. To me the passport is absolutely a symbol of that. It’s a representation of a real Irish person,” Penollar declares passionately.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Absolutely,” she said.“There is rock-solid backing for this agreement.”Ms Barley made the comments during a visit to the Border in north Co Louth on Friday afternoon.She said it is only from hearing the stories of 30 years of violence and standing where “bombs blew up” that “you get a real feeling of how important the Good Friday Agreement is”.She said it was up to the British government to put forward a solution to the current impasse.“It was the British decision to leave the EU so it’s their obligation also to propose how it will work.“We have an agreement and we stick to this agreement.“If there are other propositions by the British government to be made they may make them but the backstop is something that will not be negotiated, definitely not.”She added: “If they want to make any change then they have to have very concrete ideas and propositions.”But Ms Barley said she couldn’t see this happening.“I can only see and hear what they do not want and that is not enough,” she said.Ms Barley was accompanied on her tour of the Border by Labour party leader Brendan Howlin, Labour senator Ged Nash and SDLP Brexit spokeswoman Claire Hanna.Ms Barley also met with Border Communities Against Brexit, the Centre for Cross Border Studies, and the Dundalk and Drogheda Chambers of Commerce during her visit.Mr Howlin said it was very important to have such a senior German minister visit the Border region and meet with Border communities.“For that reason I would encourage not only our European colleagues to do that . . . but our British colleagues who speak authoritatively about a border they’ve never seen.”The Wexford TD said the withdrawal agreement was the only deal on the table.Ms Hanna praised the German minister for “coming and seeing first hand” the complexity of the border issue.The Belfast MLA said: “It almost takes you to come to a place like this to see just how intertwined we are north and south and that it isn’t about policing a line so to speak it’s about all of the knock on effects it has on businesses and communities on both sides of the border.” – PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3779383.1549063961!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord what s the beef with taking a lead on climate change","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael and Danny Healy-Rae suggested the Taoiseach had done a grave disservice to the struggling Irish beef sector.Beef farmers were very annoyed with the Taoiseach recently for daring to remark that he is trying to cut down on the amount of red meat he eats. Such was the backlash from Opposition Deputies outraged on their behalf that Leo was forced to tell the Dáil that he still enjoyed a good steak, and his comments were personal and not in any way encouraging people to give up beef.“I said that I was trying to eat less red meat for two reasons: namely health and climate change. My comment was not flippant. It is a fact that red meat increases the risk of cancer and contributes more to climate change,” the Taoiseach explained.“I can assure Deputies that I haven’t become a vegan or anything like that,” protested Leo, adding he was very happy “to eat fish landed in Donegal and poultry, turkey, pork and all of the wonderful products that Irish farmers produce”.Of course, there were no vegetarians in Leinster House until 1992. Not many people know this.However, chef Julie Lyons, one of the longest serving members of the Oireachtas staff and custodian of all the catering secrets, does.She recalls when the Green Party’s Trevor Sargent first entered Dáil Éireann in 1992, causing a minor panic in the kitchens as he was a committed vegetarian who grew his own organic produce.“Oh yes, Trevor brought in the vegetarianism. He wanted proper meals – something like a bought-in spring roll wouldn’t do him. Back in those days we didn’t know very much about it because people never asked for a vegetarian option.The slim pickings menu changed when the Greens did well in the 2007 election and went into coalition with Fianna Fáil and the PDs. Trevor (who is now a Church of Ireland priest in Waterford) stepped down as leader, although he accepted a junior ministry and the party also bagged two cabinet seats along with a brace of Senators.“When the Greens got into power all of a sudden we had 30 vegetarian meals every day. Every year they held their Christmas parties in here on a Monday night, and we used to be nearly crying because we had to do 120 vegetarian meals and the kitchens would be coming down with turkey and ham.”Today there is always a decent choice in Leinster House for the growing numbers of non-meat eaters. Although TDs and Senators, particularly from the bigger parties, are big meat-eaters, the breakfast or teatime fry is still a winner with lots of them.Down through the years, Julie has noticed a few things about the eating habits of politicians. Take party leaders and government ministers who tend to eat lightly and on the run.“They tend to be a bit depressed if they’re having the fry.”Climate change. One of the reasons the Taoiseach wants to cut down on red meat. (Flatulent cattle producing methane contributing to global warming.) It’s being constantly discussed by our politicians.Anybody who passes the gates of Leinster House on a sitting day will notice that the car parks, front and back, are always jammed.That’s a lot of cars parked up all day and often into the night, although you won’t see many electric or hybrid vehicles charging away as their drivers go about their nation’s business inside.In fact you wouldn’t ever have seen a car getting a top-up at Leinster House because until yesterday afternoon there wasn’t any charging facility available.If it hadn’t been for FG Senator and former health minister James Reilly it probably wouldn’t have appeared at all.Because for all the parliamentary emissions about climate change from our TDs and Senators down the years, not one of them ever suggested the Oireachtas might set an example by installing charging points in their busy car park.Reilly, who has taken the plunge and will soon be driving an all-electric chariot, raised the issue in the Seanad over a week ago during yet another round of “Statements on Climate Change”.“The Minister spoke earlier about walking the walk instead of talking the talk. I am taking delivery of an all-electric vehicle, a Hyundai Kona,” he announced at the end of his contribution.James said he noticed the absence of charging points, and asked the Oireachtas authorities why there were none.“I am told there will be one next week. I am also told, and I am surprised about this, that I’m the first person to ask for one.“Does that mean there is not anyone else in these Houses who has an electric car? I would find that surprising.”He isn’t, and he will join a small group of owners when he finally gets his Kona, which has a battery range of 449km.This, Dr Reilly tells us, has cured his “range anxiety” – a common complaint among electric car drivers and one of the main reasons people stick with fossil fuel.In the Cabinet there is just one non-petrol head – Minister for Communications and Climate Change Richard Bruton is now driving a hybrid, while Dublin-based Róisín Shortall and Noel Rock are among the TDs who have joined the ranks.Reilly returned to the subject in the Seanad on Thursday.“As I stand here today there is still no charging point for electric cars . . . If we are to show leadership in this country and ask people to be mindful of the environment, make life changes and consider going electric or hybrid, we must lead by example.“The fact that the Oireachtas doesn’t even have charging points for people who work or might be visiting here sends such a poor message.”His pressure finally paid off yesterday, when workers arrived to put in a point in the rear car park on Merrion Street. People may be talking about the threat posed by Brexit, Reilly told the Upper House, but climate change is far more serious.“I would say that this is the challenge that will define our generation, not Brexit. We will survive Brexit, but we may not survive ongoing climate change if we do not take action.”Dr Reilly hopes the new charging point will be the first of many in Leinster House. “Because here we were in Oireachtas Éireann without even one while the Fingal council offices already have six of them. If we are going to give leadership we should be showing a lead.”Joan Burton introduced a Bill in the Dáil on Tuesday to provide legal certainty for people whose adoptive parents were illegally registered on their birth certificates as their birth parents. Minister for Children Katherine Zappone revealed at a press conference last year that 126 such cases had come to light as a result of an analysis of files from the St Patrick’s Guild agency, from where Joan herself was adopted.Yet since that announcement nothing has been done to help the people caught in this unusual situation. The former Labour leader says that the actual number of people who are in this “legal limbo” is far greater. A further 748 adoption cases are of concern, and they all relate to St Patrick’s Guild, which is only one of many such societies.The problem affects a generation of children who are now adults in their 40s, 50s, 60s and even 70s.Barrister Anne O’Meara, who discovered she is one of the 126 with a false birth cert, is the driving force behind the Bill. She had a happy childhood in a loving family, always aware she was adopted. When the information emerged about the false registrations, she assumed Zappone would move quickly to help restore legal status to those people who were illegally registered in the years following the 1952 Adoption Act. When nothing happened after a number of months she decided to come up with the legislation herself.“I can’t wait. I need something now to tell me that I am my parents’ daughter, that I was properly adopted. I am entitled to this,” she said at the launch of the Bill, which is so legally uncomplicated she drafted it in one afternoon with the help of colleagues.Burton wonders if wariness of the legalities involved might be the reason for the delay in introducing what would be a relatively simple court process. So this week O’Meara came up with a legal example which might spur on the Government – The Lourdes Marriages.The 1972 Marriage Act was passed to regularise the marriages of 33 couples who had weddings in Lourdes but in church ceremonies. They didn’t realise they also needed to take part in a civil ceremony to have their marriage recognised in French law. This meant their marriages were technically invalid under Irish law too. The Oireachtas niftily solved the problem with some retroactive legislation.Burton says that a similar simple course of action by today’s Oireachtas would do the same for O’Meara and all the others who now find themselves caught in this legal bind."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3779237.1549046326!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar to discuss next brexit steps with juncker and tusk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar will “outline the work under way in Ireland and the supports that may be needed given the potential impact of a hard Brexit in Ireland”. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Taoiseach Leo Varadkar will travel to Brussels next week to discuss no-deal preparations and a possible package of supports for Ireland with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.Mr Varadkar will also meet with the European Council president Donald Tusk – who heads the EU’s highest body, the council of heads of governments – for discussions on Brexit and the likely next steps.In addition to Mr Varadkar’s visit to the European Commission, officials from Brussels will fly to Dublin next week for discussions with the Irish Government on no-deal preparations. It’s likely that measures to protect the single market in the event of a no-deal will be on the agenda, although both Dublin and Brussels have stressed that the commission visit to Dublin is part of a series of visits to all European capitals.The Irish Government insists there will be no return to a hard border in the event of a no-deal but also says it will have to protect the EU single market. However, it has not, so far, said how it would achieve this.According to a statement from Government Buildings, Mr Varadkar will “outline the work under way in Ireland and the supports that may be needed given the potential impact of a hard Brexit in Ireland.”With Mr Tusk, the Taoiseach will “discuss the latest developments in London. Mr Varadkar will use the opportunity once again to thank the institutions, and the other member states, for their continuing support for Ireland”, the statement says.Meanwhile, Tánaiste Simon Coveney is due to travel to Washington DC next week, where he will meet a number of Irish-American politicians amid growing concern in Congress about Brexit.On Tuesday a resolution opposing the reimposition of a hard border in Northern Ireland was introduced in the US Congress by congressman Brendan Boyle. It calls on Congress to oppose the establishment of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Sources in Dublin and Brussels say they expect few significant public developments until further votes in the British parliament on February 14th, though there are likely to be intensive private contacts between Dublin, Brussels and London.The mood is hardening on the EU side, however, with several senior sources adamant that there is no prospect of concessions to the British in the immediate future. EU leaders await Mrs May’s proposals on alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border, but there is little expectation that they will go beyond suggestions that have been rejected in the past.Senior figures expect there will be no move from the EU until after EU leaders meet at the EU-Africa summit in Egypt in late February, by which time they expect matters to have evolved significantly at Westminster, sources say.In the meantime, it’s expected that the EU focus will be on preparations for a possible no-deal outcome, rather than diplomacy to avoid it.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Johannes ElseleAFPGetty ImagesThis week the bid to take on Donald Trump, the presumed Republican nominee in the 2020 presidential election, stepped up a gear.Senator Kamala Harris officially launched her campaign in Oakland, California, gaining primetime TV coverage on an otherwise quiet Sunday afternoon. On Friday, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey announced his bid.But it was another well-known Democrat who ruffled most feathers. Howard Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, announced he was mulling a run. Though he describes himself as a “lifelong Democrat”, the billionaire businessman announced on CBS’s 60 Minutes that he would run as an Independent if he decides to contest.“We look at both parties, we see extremes on both sides,” he said. “The American people are exhausted. Their trust has been broken. And they are looking for a better choice.”The reaction from Democrats was swift and unequivocal. “We’ve seen this movie before,” snapped Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Florida congresswoman who chaired the Democratic National Committee during the last presidential primary campaign. “He doesn’t quite grasp the depth of the impact that that decision would have on our ability to defeat Donald Trump,” she said. “It would be incredibly damaging.”Ms Wasserman Schultz was referring to past presidential runs by Independents. The ghosts of Ross Perot and Ralph Nader still stalk the collective Democratic and Republican memory. In the 1992 presidential election, Mr Perot staged a strong third-party bid, winning 19 per cent of the popular vote, which many Republicans still believe cost George HW Bush the election.Meanwhile, Democrats are still wounded by the 2000 presidential campaign when Green Party candidate Nader received more than 97,000 votes in Florida. Given that the state was ultimately won by George W Bush by only 537 votes following one of the most contentious recounts in history, many believe Mr Nader cost Al Gore the presidency.There are also examples from more recent history. Some Democrats will never forgive Jill Stein, who ran for the Green Party in 2016. She won more votes in Wisconsin than Mr Trump’s winning margin over Hillary Clinton in the state.Mr Schultz has hit back. He believes he represents a centrist vision that many Americans can relate to. Describing himself as a fiscal conservative but with socially-liberal views on issues such as abortion and gun control, the 65-year-old has cited the fact that 40 per cent of Americans identify themselves as Independent.But analysts have pointed out that despite this, most voters have a favourable view of either one of the two main parties and are unlikely to vote for an Independent in anything near the numbers that could deliver victory in the electoral college system. While many Democrats believe the two-party system is flawed, they also believe that now is not the time to fix it, when the prospect of a second Trump term looms.As well as the possibility of a Schultz bid fracturing the vote in the presidential election, the billionaire’s intervention has given Democrats another headache by exposing the isions between the more progressive and centrist wings of the party. As it faces a crowded field of primary contenders, he has forced a very public conversation this week about what kind of Democrat should run in 2020. More than two years after the acrimonious primary battle between Bernie Sanders and Mrs Clinton, the isions over the kind of politics represented by both are still not resolved.Fresh from a successful House campaign in the midterms which returned dozens of women, non-white and progressive candidates, the liberal wing of the party has a new spring in its step. So far, more leftist candidates have declared, with Elizabeth Warren proposing a tax on high earners, which Mr Schultz, unsurprisingly, opposes.Ms Harris too has been flaunting her liberal credentials, confirming this week that she supports Medicare for all, a proposal that will delight the more liberal wing of the party, but may not attract centrist suburban voters fearful of losing their healthcare plans.But others believe the party needs to tack towards the centre in order to guard against another Trump victory. Already this week Joe Biden, who is also mulling a run, highlighted his centrist credentials and willingness to work across the aisle during an appearance in Washington DC.As the Democratic field begins to take shape, the key question for potential candidates is how they will position themselves within this ideological framework.Mr Schultz may never formally launch a campaign. But he has started an important conversation about what kind of candidate can take on Mr Trump."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

High-ranking chiefs in the Iron Age were laid to rest with their chariots along with their horses and weapons.Mr Smith, who has detected metal for 30 years, is now set to make a windfall following his ancient find after it was declared treasure by a coroner at an inquest in Milford Haven. He expects to land up to £1 million or more for his discovery. Mike Smith, 45 (second from right) was stunned when he detected a Celtic chariot dating back more than 2,000 yearsThe payment must be shared equally with the landowner, who has not been named.Mr Smith said: It\u0027s guess work but you\u0027re definitely talking six or seven figures.It\u0027s the biggest ever metal detecting find, as in there\u0027s never been a chariot ever discovered by a metal detectorist.There have been hoards found, but never anything like this.Mr Smith first found what he thought was a medieval broach but turned out to be part of a Celtic horse harness.He went straight back the following day and found more red enamel pieces - dating to between AD 25 to 75.Mike, of Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, said: I knew the importance of them straight away.It was just instinct. I\u0027d read all about chariot burials and just wished it could have been me, so finding this has been a privilege.The exact location of his amazing find is being kept secret for a major dig - but is located in south Pembrokeshire.National Museum Wales said it will now try to buy the treasure items found by Mr Smith.Adam Gwilt, the museum\u0027s principal curator of prehistoric archaeology, said: These chariot pieces may have been witness to some of the historical events of the time, as Iron Age peoples defended their ways of life and identities, in the face of an expanding Roman empire.Mother of three-year-old is first in Britain to be convicted of female genital mutilationUS to scrap INF treaty: How nuclear pact with Russia made world safer - and why an arms race loomsWhy Sandhurst\u0026#39s first female company sergeant major will not play up to stereotypesBritain\u0026#39s most endangered species identified for first time as Natural England launches \u0026#39Back from the Brink\u0026#39 campaignArticle 50 extension \u0026#39not impossible\u0026#39 accepts Jacob Rees-Mogg, as two more ministers say Brexit delay may be neededJeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s popularity sinks to all-time low due Labour\u0026#39s Brexit policySocial media firms face \u0026#34duty of care\u0026#34 laws to protect children from online harmsComment: A short extension to the timetable to deliver Brexit is not impossibleOne in four MPs expected to miss special \u0026#39Brexit sitting\u0026#39 of House of Commons to be with familiesMike Pence tells Venezuelan exiles in Miami: \u0026#39This is no time for dialogue.

This is time for action, he said.The time has come to end the Maduro dictatorship once and for all.”Removing Mr Maduro has been a priority for Mr Trump right from the beginning of his presidency, but has become an obsession for the White House since Mr Guaido, president of the national assembly, declared himself “interim president” on January 23.Mike Pence addressing Venezuelan exiles in MiamiOn Friday John Bolton, the national security adviser and one of the most strident Venezuela hawks, attempted to reduce the temperature somewhat, saying he did not believe US military intervention was imminent.He reacted angrily to reports that Mr Maduro was planning to send 15 tonnes of gold from central bank vaults to the United Arab Emirates in coming days, in return for euros in cash.Oil sanctions announced by the US last week are hitting hard, and Mr Maduro is becoming increasingly desperate to find means of keeping his regime afloat – including accessing $1.5 billion of gold kept in the Bank of England’s vaults.“Not only does Maduro require foreign paramilitary support to keep remaining threads of a failed dictatorship, but reports show he is flying out Venezuelan assets by the plane full,” Mr Bolton tweeted.“Is he stealing resources from the people to pay for Russian intervention?”Venezuelan exiles listen to Mike Pence in Miami on FridayMr Guaidohas urged his supporters to take to the streets on Saturday and demand the resignation of Mr Maduro, who is clinging to power with the support of Russia, China and Iran.Mr Maduro, 56, on Friday tweeted a video of himself inspecting troops. The military, which has so far remained largely loyal, is seen as holding the key to Mr Maduro’s future. Mr Guaido has appealed to the forces to defect, and wrote an open letter to soldiers offering amnesty – which many of them publicly burnt.The 35-year-old published an open letter to Mexico and Uruguay, turning down their offer of mediation in talks with Mr Maduro and saying he would only consider talks “when the usurpation is over”.He argues that Mr Maduro’s May election was fraudulent, and so the end of his term, in January, marked the end of his legitimate rule. He insists that, with the presidency “vacant”, he, as the president of the national assembly, becomes under the constitution the “interim president”.Juan Guaido with his 20-month-old daughter at his home in Caracas, which was visited by Venezuelan police on FridayJeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, expressed dismay at Mr Guaido’s position, siding instead with his friend Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, president of Mexico, and criticising the British foreign secretary for calling for further sanctions.“The future of Venezuela is a matter for Venezuelans. Jeremy Hunt\u0027s call for more sanctions on Venezuela is wrong. We oppose outside interference in Venezuela, whether from the US or anywhere else.“There needs to be dialogue and a negotiated settlement to overcome the crisis.”The European Parliament officially recognised Mr Guaido on Thursday, and urged the European Union to follow suit. A series of European countries, among them Britain, Spain, France and Germany, have set a deadline for Sunday for Mr Maduro to call elections, or else they will join the US, Canada, Australia, Israel and many Latin American nations in recognising Mr Guaido.Pro-Maduro protesters holding up a poster of the late Hugo Chavez take to the streets of Caracas on ThursdayFrancisco Sucre, the head of the international committee of Venezuela’s national assembly, on Friday called on Mr Maduro to step down.Speaking in Spain, at the end of a trip designed to rally support for Mr Guaido, he said that the international contact group announced on Thursday by the EU\u0027s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, should help to cease the usurpation of power by Maduro and establish a transitional government until new elections.He added: There is no possible discussion here, Maduro has to leave.He said Venezuela, under Mr Guaido, welcomes the EU\u0027s involvement because we are going to need its cooperation during the initial stages of the recovery of our country.Power is evaporating from Maduro\u0027s hands with the passing of the hours, he said.We have been contacted by diplomatic workers across Europe who are ready to take a step forward, but they are waiting for the right moment.Please review our commenting policyMother of three-year-old is first in Britain to be convicted of female genital mutilationUS to scrap INF treaty: How nuclear pact with Russia made world safer - and why an arms race loomsWhy Sandhurst\u0026#39s first female company sergeant major will not play up to stereotypesBritain\u0026#39s most endangered species identified for first time as Natural England launches \u0026#39Back from the Brink\u0026#39 campaignArticle 50 extension \u0026#39not impossible\u0026#39 accepts Jacob Rees-Mogg, as two more ministers say Brexit delay may be neededJeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s popularity sinks to all-time low due Labour\u0026#39s Brexit policySocial media firms face \u0026#34duty of care\u0026#34 laws to protect children from online harmsOne in four MPs expected to miss special \u0026#39Brexit sitting\u0026#39 of House of Commons to be with familiesComment: A short extension to the timetable to deliver Brexit is not impossibleBan gambling firm logos on football clubs\u0026#39 shirts, says Church of EnglandTeachers should be exempted from SNP\u0026#39s \u0026#39ridiculous\u0026#39 parking taxHow Venezuela\u0026#39s crisis is fuelling prostitution and sex trafficking on Spain\u0026#39s Costa del SolComment: Technology is the new tobacco, and parents are losing the battle to protect their children from itUK weather: Snow causes chaos as temperatures hit lowest for seven years - latest news and forecastElderly woman who waged 15-year hate campaign on working class neighbours is finally jailedSexual abuse of nuns by priests is denounced by Vatican women\u0026#39s magazine Donald Trump says he has \u0026#39lost massive amounts of money\u0026#39 serving as presidentSenior HMRC civil servant dismissed after claims of \u0026#39sexual harassment and assault\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 1 february 2019","story":"Rosie the fox coming out of her underground den to meet her friend Maddy the terrier.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightNow, the events have been updated to match this greater sense of inclusivity. Ahrendts said, “I always say that the stores are Apple’s biggest product. I think that the architecture of the stores, that’s our hardware and what we do inside is the software. This is an updated software release of the in-store experience. We have over 50 new sessions. Altogether there are 18,000 sessions a week worldwide.”She went on to say that when the Apple Stores were created by Steve Jobs, that the staff were not there to sell. “You know, Steve built Apple Retail. And he told the teams when he hired them that they\u0027re not allowed to sell. He said they have no commission, no quotas. He told them, ‘Your job is to enrich their lives and you have to do it through the lens of education.’ He also said that Apple is the crossroads between liberal arts and technology. Well, we were brilliant in the stores at technology. But how do we unlock that liberal arts piece?”“Being a creative all my life, it\u0027s kind of a dream job for me to help communities be more creative,” Karl Heiselman, a former CEO of brand consultants Wolff Olins, explained. Apple employs staffers in its stores called Creative Pros, who are as heavily trained as the people in the Genius Bars. “We have 3,400 Creative Pros organised by passion or theme –\u0026nbspso photography, music, art and design, coding and app development. They go deep on each one of those, and these people are amazing. Some of them are Emmy winners, celebrated artists and musicians.”Ahrendts added:\u0026nbsp“If you’re a photographer and that’s your passion, we’ll help make you a better photographer, we’ll demo a lens for you. That whole experience of what you do with your iPhone, we want to give you a rich physical experience as well.” The Creative Pros were key to developing the new sessions.Heiselman also made clear that these people are not there just to talk at you. “The thing that defines Today at Apple is it’s not just sharing your story, everyone gets a hands-on. That participatory piece is very important. Because we always say you don\u0027t want to create a session which is like something you can do on the Internet. So maybe an illustrator might share their story and their work and then we hand out iPads and say it’s your turn. We try to, as much as we can, have the audience give it a go.”So, give it a go I did, at previews of the new schedule.New Apple handset to feature three cameras for 3D imagesThe world’s tech giants are about the feel the pinchApple blocks Facebook from installing its internal apps on iPhonesThere are three kinds of sessions in Today at Apple: Skills, Walks and Labs – though the basic sessions introducing customers to Apple products and the ones aimed at explaining accessibility features will continue as before.Skills are the sessions which focus on a particular feature, such as the one I attended on GarageBand, Apple’s deceptively complex music creation app: it looks simple from the outside but is extensive and feature-rich.\u0026nbspI’ve used it but hadn’t been aware of the seemingly endless range of drums available in it. As with all Today at Apple events, you don’t need to bring your own Apple product, or even own one. They’re supplied when you get there, including – to the relief of the other customers in the Apple Store – Beats headphones to keep my attempts at music private. The purpose of the session was pretty specific, to create a beat using the beat sequencer.There are three sections to each event, inspiration, participation and celebration. This means introducing the topic in enough detail to get people wanting to try it and then let them loose on doing it. The final section involved participants sharing their newly created beats. Of course, sharing what you’ve done is voluntary.The Walks events begin inside an Apple Store and then move outdoors. Photography walks have been a staple of Today at Apple for a while, often showing locals parts of their towns they’ve never really seen before. I went to an Art Walk using the amazingly detailed digital illustration app, Procreate. Armed with an iPad Pro, we strolled the area around the store taking photos of colours that took our eye, from a pale green leaf to an eye-searingly bright yellow fire hydrant. These colours were incorporated into the app’s palette and from there we were encouraged to create our own art. My effort, which a psychiatrist might call a cry for help, is below.Walks are the most popular type of session, Heiselman said.And then there are the Labs. These are the most indepth of the events, lasting up to 90 minutes. I tried out \u0027Video Lab: Small Screen Magic, co-created with Zach King\u0027,\u0026nbspwhich concentrated on how to use a jump-cut technique in Apple’s short video app, Clips. The huge video wall was the focus here, where a specially recorded video introduction\u0026nbspfrom King, a YouTube star known for his “digital sleight of hand” was screened.This screen, by the way, has become so central to these stores that the staff jokingly refer to them as being powered by “Wall OS”. And it’s a magnet: once the session started, scores of people who happened to be in the store stopped to hover and watch.The participation section here was particularly fun and the Apple Store was momentarily taken over by the simulation of vanishing and reappearing chairs while attendees performed precipitous prat falls. When edited together, the final cut movies were shown on the wall.All these sessions are free, with materials provided and no selling involved, though the Creative Pros are knowledgeable about the company’s products as well, so can advise you if you’re interested.\u0026nbspAnd those Pros are pretty remarkable. Ahrendts said they’d been training for months, and it shows. They are professional, unflappable and relaxed performers, eager to share their knowledge and their passion.When Apple’s iPhone sales have dipped, as revealed in the latest figures, it’s interesting to see a company make a considerable investment in staffing sessions like this.\u0026nbspBut it’s a cool way to tempt people through its doors.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

How much is Germany’s slowdown actually due to Brexit? And how damaging would a no-deal scenario be for Europe’s largest economy?Click to followThe IndependentGermany’s Economy Minister, Peter Altmaier, this week unveiled a rather brutal downgrade in his country’s official growth forecast for 2019, from 1.8 per cent to just 1 per cent. This came on the back of the worst year of GDP growth for Germany (1.5\u0026nbspper cent in 2018) in five years.And one of the reasons Mr Altmaier cited for the downgrade was the negative impact of Brexit.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIf German politicians like Mr Altmaier appreciate that their own country’s economic self-interest is tightly related to avoiding a no-deal Brexit that could change the terms of trade of the EU-UK Brexit negotiations, goes the thinking.But does the logic here stand up? How much is Germany’s slowdown actually due to Brexit? And how damaging would a no-deal scenario even be for Europe’s largest economy?Germany slumps to worst growth in five years in 2018Germany exported around $95bn of goods and services to the UK in 2017, making us the country’s fourth largest export market, after the US, France and China.But Andrew Kenningham, a Europe specialist at Capital Economics, is sceptical that a weakening UK economy ahead of Brexit was the primary reason for slowing German growth last year, noting that industrial disruption due to new automotive emissions regulations was influential in the third quarter contraction.“I don’t think most people would see Brexit see as the main reason for it,” he said.“It’s true that exports from Germany to the UK have been declining. They’ve probably been the weakest of its major export destinations. But they’ve also slowed a lot in China, they’ve slowed to other emerging economies, including Turkey and Russia. It’s not just exports to the UK have collapsed while everyone else is doing fine.”Oliver Rakau, a Frankfurt-based economist for Oxford Economics, says Mr Altmaier was simply listing the long menu of reasons for the slowdown, rather than singling out Brexit.He suspects, based on data released previously in Beijing, that the big drag in terms of German exports in the final quarter of 2018 will turn out to be due to waning demand in China rather than the UK.But Mr Kenningham suggests that Mr Altmaier might have mentioned Brexit for political reasons, rather than economic ones.The economy minister has been vocal for some time about the importance of avoiding a no-deal Brexit and has suggested that the UK should be allowed to extend the Article 50 process to avoid the 29 March cliff edge.But what about the hugely important German car industry? Here the bigger hit to business has been Donald Trump’s trade wars, rather than Brexit, according to analysts.Nevertheless, concerns about Brexit could be dampening corporate business investment in Germany, which has been relatively weak.Exports falling – but not just to the UKBut what about a no-deal Brexit in March? How damaging would that be for Germany? Could that rising threat galvanise politicians in Berlin?In the long-term the IMF estimates that the UK being forced to trade on bare World Trade Organisation terms would cost the UK almost 4 per cent of GDP, versus less than 0.5 per cent for Germany.But what about the immediate impact, the disruption in 2019?Mr Kenningham notes that Germany’s exports of goods and services to the UK account for around 3 per cent of its GDP.“Even if they were hit hard – say a 10 per cent fall for a few months – it wouldn’t have a huge impact if you look at it arithmetically,” he says.But he concedes that’s a narrow way of looking at it.And Mr Rakau thinks that a no-deal would certainly increase the chances of Germany tipping into recession.More pain for UK than Germany from no-deal BrexitSo could car companies, and German industry more broadly, come to the rescue of the UK government and put pressure on Ms Merkel to accommodate the British, perhaps at the expense of Ireland, which wants the backstop to be entirely untouched?Analysts are not expecting that.“I know it’s often cited in the UK that Germany industry will put on pressure – but I don’t foresee that,” says Mr Rakau.“Even the German industrial associations have put out press releases saying this is for the British side to sort out.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two thirds of the earnings came from the cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services, which boasts fatter margins than Santa after a sackful of mince pies. It\u0026nbsphas a habit of defying analysts expectations on the upside which it did this time around. \u0026nbspDespite all this, Wall Street managed to get itself into a tizzy. Its scribblers and analysts drew their breath in through their teeth and pushed out a cloud of critical comment. The reason: the firm\u0027s guidance for revenues in the three month current quarter came in at\u0026nbspbetween $56bn (£43bn) and $60bn. That was\u0026nbspa shade below the $60.7bn they had pencilled it.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAmazon rolls out new delivery robot called ScoutAmazon builds vest for workers to protect them from robotsThe small miss was big enough for the shares to take a tumble in after market trading, when they lost more than\u0026nbsp5 per cent of their value.\u0026nbspWhen you consider that Amazon is capitalised at $840bn in total, that\u0027s a lot of value to shed. Some $45bn in fact.In sterling terms that amounts to £34bn, which a third more than you buy all the shares in Tesco for. The latter is capitalised at just under £22bn.\u0026nbspThe number crunchers were particularly concerned about the giant’s international business, which is still losing money.\u0026nbspAlthough losses have been falling, the Indian government has thrown a fly into the ointment with new rules designed to protect local businesses from giant foreign e commerce operators.\u0026nbspIt has done the sort of thing Britain’s bombed out bricks and mortar retailers have been calling upon our Government to have a go at, without (to date) much success.\u0026nbspWhile this has resulted in the removal of some of products from Amazon’s website, the company has responded by hunkering down and promising to keep at it. Which is what it always does.\u0026nbspOh and finance chief Brian Olsavsky says it’s going to spend more money this year. There is no greater exponent of that old proverb “you’ve got to spend money to make money” than Amazon.There are many, many reasons for criticising the monster this business has become, and feeling ambivalent about the impact it has had on the world.\u0026nbspIts workers are sometimes treated very poorly. It has had a devastating effect on other businesses. It pays about enough tax to buy a couple of Echo Dots (that’s the company’s crazily high selling crazily cheap mini speaker) and a month’s subscription to Amazon Music to go with them.Then there’s the corporate welfare it’s been sucking in back home in America. \u0026nbspYet you still have to admire the way its founder and CEO Jeff Bezos seems sublimely unconcerned about the huffing and puffing of analysts and commentators in response to the latest quarterly results.\u0026nbspI even saw one saying they thought the best may be over for the business.

Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

The Super Bowl attracts huge audiences - last year, more than 100 million viewers tuned in to watch the game in the US and similar numbers are expected this year. For new brands, a Super Bowl ad can bring its products to the attention of millions of people instantly, which many would argue justifies the high fee. According to advertising consultancy, in 2018 some new brands raised brand awareness by 36.5 per cent after their Super Bowl ad aired. However, these days exposure can be achieved a lot more cheaply, and most of the brands snapping up space in the Super Bowl ad breaks are already well-known names, like Amazon, Pepsi and Budweiser.For companies like these, Super Bowl ads act as a signal to the world that their brand is doing well, and tells consumers that they can trust in their products.Super Bowl 2019: Odds, Vegas betting lines, moneyline and prop bets 10 Super Bowl commercials that have gone down in TV historyEverything you need to know about the 2019 Super BowlHow to watch Super Bowl 2019 It is virtually impossible to calculate the return on investment for a Super Bowl ad, but each year a handful of brands will win out in the battle to become a talking point long after the final whistle blows. And even if an ad goes viral for all the wrong reasons, it might not be a complete failure for the company behind it. “Even though a Super Bowl advertising campaign might not pay immediately in hard dollars and cents, if a business can afford to produce one of these stellar spots, they stand to earn new customers and build awareness on a scale unmatched by other outlets,” according to Peter Koeppel, founder and president of marketing agency Koeppel Direct.“Good or bad, though, impactful Super Bowl ads are the ones that are getting talked about. What a marketer can’t afford is an ad that completely fails to deliver. Because the Super Bowl is also sort of a Super Bowl of marketing, the competition is fierce – the commercials have to be memorable for them to pay off in the long run. “An ad that doesn’t give viewers something, for better or worse, won’t be a profitable one.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2743 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part3043 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.3143 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves3243 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.3343 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.3443 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete.

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4143 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4243 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped.

Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4343 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 143 Cancer breath test to be trialled in BritainThe breath biopsy device is designed to detect cancer hallmarks in molecules exhaled by patients243 Average 10 year old has consumed the recommended amount of sugar for an adult By their 10th birthdy, children have on average already eaten more sugar than the recommended amount for an 18 year old.

The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part3043 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.3143 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves3243 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.3343 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.3443 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3543 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3643 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3743 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3843 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3943 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.4043 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4143 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4243 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4343 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. However, Rutgers University in the United States last year\u0026nbspconcluded students scored the equivalent of half a grade less in end-of-term tests if they were allowed to use their devices for non-academic reasons in their classes.Children will also be told to break off at least every two hours and avoid social media before bedtime, according to\u0026nbspguidance from chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies,\u0026nbspThe Daily Mail reported. Parents will be told to limit children’s screen time to protect their health.The UK would be following in the footsteps of European counterparts if schools were to introduce a mobile phone ban, with French pupils being told to leave their smartphones at home when they returned from their summer holidays last year.Teachers in the UK have also complained about pupils being distracted or using the phones to take upskirt images of staff in the classroom.Toddler development delayed by too much screentime, research suggestsMr Gibb is the latest figure in education to support such a move, with former Ofsted head Sir Michael Wilshaw saying devices were disrupting lessons.Speaking at the Festival of Education at Wellington College last summer, Sir Michael said that “any sensible head would ban mobile phones”.He\u0026nbspadded: “It’s interesting that President Macron is now bringing in legislation in France to ban mobile phones in state schools in France. We should do the same here.\u0026nbspIt’s far too distracting for children having mobile phones. Texting, sexting, all this takes place.

Facebook development teams would do well to look at this precedent and prioritise user privacy,” Mr MacKey told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“With the integration project currently expected to take a year to complete, and with end-to-end encryption as part of the plan, we should expect the Facebook engineering teams to focus attention on uniform data security both in their platform and in the apps themselves.”In response to such privacy concerns, Facebook said in a statement: “We’re working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks. As you would expect, there is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work.”Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, which regulates the social network in the EU, has since called for an urgent briefing on the matter in order to assess the how the proposals will fit with GDPR rules.\u0026nbsp“Previous proposals to share data between Facebook companies have given rise to significant data protection concerns and the Irish DPC will be seeking early assurances that all such concerns will be fully taken into account by Facebook\u0026nbspin further developing this proposal,” the commission said in a statement.\u0026nbsp“It must be emphasised that ultimately the proposed integration can only occur in the EU if it is capable of meeting all of the requirements of the GDPR.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That meant the scientists could take all of those different pieces of data – related to 700 different places in all – and combine them to understand the gravity on the surface.As the rover started to climb up a hill on the surface, the amount of gravity went up. But it did not go up as much as expected.The lower levels of Mount Sharp are surprisingly porous, says lead author Kevin Lewis of Johns Hopkins University. We know the bottom layers of the mountain were buried over time. That compacts them, making them denser. But this finding suggests they weren\u0027t buried by as much material as we thought.Scientists could use the findings to help understand where places like Mount Sharp came from, and how the Martian surface developed.There are still many questions about how Mount Sharp developed, but this paper adds an important piece to the puzzle, said Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity\u0027s project scientist at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which manages the mission. I\u0027m thrilled that creative scientists and engineers are still finding innovative ways to make new scientific discoveries with the rover.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ashley’s purchase saved the brand, but half of its 62 UK stores will close, putting hundreds out of work.Ashley has agreed to buy Sofa for “a nominal sum”, ending a battle with ScS Group for the online furniture retailer.The Sports Direct owner seems to be linked to just about every high street store that has struggled over the past year. He has held talks with HMV’s administrators and is rumoured to be sniffing around posh cake chain Patisserie Valerie.Putting an exact figure on the value of his combined holdings is tricky but Forbes puts it at $3bn (£2.3bn).Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He’ll have the entire high street soonHe has bought heavily into the high street as it faces some of its toughest ever trading conditions. Close to four in 10 listed retailers issued profit warnings last year, with some doing so on multiple occasions.Emma Shipp, partner at Hewitsons, said Mr Ashley’s history with House of Fraser and Evans Cycles suggests he will continue to cut staff and close stores across all of his recent purchases.Ms Shipp added: “Landlords should expect to come under increasing pressure to reduce rent or offer rent-free periods.\u0026nbsp“Cross pollination between his businesses is another likely outcome – witness the introduction of Agent Provocateur lingerie at House of Fraser stores last year\u0026nbspwhich are both Ashley owned.“For the moment, an overriding strategy in these acquisitions is hard to discern and some have likened it to a ‘Monopoly board’ power grab.”ScS, which stands for “Sofa Carpet Specialist”, has concessions in House of Fraser stores but announced in October that it would pull out because the partnership was no longer beneficial after Mr Ashley’s takeover of the department store chain.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In that respect, it will work similarly to the Face ID scanner that currently allows people to unlock their phones with facial recognition – but it will use different a different method, and work over much longer distances.The laser-powered camera will be part of a phone that will also include upgraded chips, an improved lens system as well as alterations to how the phones can take photos, the same report claimed.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

That will help Apple\u0027s push into augmented reality, which has seen it release a range of tools to allow people to overlay virtual objects onto the real world.iPhone price to be reduced in many countries, Apple saysThe extra sensing capabilities could also improve traditional photos, allowing for images that capture better depth, according to the Bloomberg report.The technologies could be a trial run for Apple\u0027s plans for an augmented reality headset or glasses, which it has been repeatedly rumoured to be working on\u0026nbsp– and which the company has not explicitly denied.Apple\u0027s 2019 phone will also have a range of improvements to its camera technologies, according to the same report. They will include three cameras to allow for improved photo capabilities, which could allow for the phone to take a larger field of view, better zoom, and potentially allowing the phone to automatically improve photos or videos after they are taken.The 3D cameras were being worked on for this year\u0027s phones but were not ready in time, the Bloomberg report claimed. Instead, they will come to next year\u0027s line on the the 2020 version of the\u0026nbspiPhone XS Max, though they might not make it onto the upgraded versions of the XS and XR.As well as new camera technologies, Apple plans to improve the software used to take photos. That will include changes to the Live Photos feature – which captures video either side of a photo to allow people to see them in context – so that they take six seconds of video rather than three.The new phones will also have improved chips and an updated Face ID sensor so the phones unlock more quickly. Otherwise, they are expected to look largely similae to this year\u0027s models, with more dramatic changes coming in 2020.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And it could offer an opportunity to look back into the beginning of the cosmos.The tiny galaxy is only 30 million light-years away but is so dark and distant that it was only found while astronomers were looking for something else entirely.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialScientists made the discovery while they were using the Hubble Space Telescope to look at the white dwarf stars in a globular cluster known as NGC 672. They had hoped to use those stars to measure the age of the cluster.But as they did so they spotted the small set of stars on the edge of the area they were observing. After analysis, they found the stars did not belong to the cluster they were looking at – a part of the Milky Way – but were in fact millions of light-years away from it.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

It measures only 3000 light-years across even at its longest point, making it just a fraction of the size of our own Milky Way.Repeated radio signals coming from galaxy 1.5 billion lightyears awayIt is dark as it is feint. Together, those porperties led astronomers to classify it as what is called a\u0026nbspdwarf spheroidal galaxy.Such galaxies are defined by their small size and dim light, as well as their lack of dust and old stellar populations. Reserchers have found 36 galaxies of this kind in our nearby area, 22 of which are satellite galaxies around our own Milky Way.Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are not uncommon, but the newly discovered one is strange in a number of ways. It is extremely isolated, about 30 million light-years from the Milky Way and two million light-years from its nearest possible host – making it the most isolated of any small dwarf galaxy ever found.From studying its stars, scientists found that the galaxy is around 13 billion years old, making it nearly as old as the entire universe. Because it is so distant from any other galaxies – and so has been left largely undisturbed – as well as its old age, the astronomers refer to Bedin 1 as a fossil from the beginning of th ecosmos.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

The Super Bowl attracts huge audiences - last year, more than 100 million viewers tuned in to watch the game in the US and similar numbers are expected this year. For new brands, a Super Bowl ad can bring its products to the attention of millions of people instantly, which many would argue justifies the high fee. According to advertising consultancy, in 2018 some new brands raised brand awareness by 36.5 per cent after their Super Bowl ad aired. However, these days exposure can be achieved a lot more cheaply, and most of the brands snapping up space in the Super Bowl ad breaks are already well-known names, like Amazon, Pepsi and Budweiser.For companies like these, Super Bowl ads act as a signal to the world that their brand is doing well, and tells consumers that they can trust in their products.Super Bowl 2019: Odds, Vegas betting lines, moneyline and prop bets 10 Super Bowl commercials that have gone down in TV historyEverything you need to know about the 2019 Super BowlHow to watch Super Bowl 2019 It is virtually impossible to calculate the return on investment for a Super Bowl ad, but each year a handful of brands will win out in the battle to become a talking point long after the final whistle blows. And even if an ad goes viral for all the wrong reasons, it might not be a complete failure for the company behind it. “Even though a Super Bowl advertising campaign might not pay immediately in hard dollars and cents, if a business can afford to produce one of these stellar spots, they stand to earn new customers and build awareness on a scale unmatched by other outlets,” according to Peter Koeppel, founder and president of marketing agency Koeppel Direct.“Good or bad, though, impactful Super Bowl ads are the ones that are getting talked about. What a marketer can’t afford is an ad that completely fails to deliver. Because the Super Bowl is also sort of a Super Bowl of marketing, the competition is fierce – the commercials have to be memorable for them to pay off in the long run. “An ad that doesn’t give viewers something, for better or worse, won’t be a profitable one.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

doing?Click to followThe IndependentFor some, it is just a case of making sure they have ample supplies of their favourite marmalade, or at least the basics like “baked beans and bog roll”.Other so-called “Brexit preppers”, however, seem ready to summon up images of no-deal ushering in something akin to the Apocalypse.“Allow at least three litres of water per adult per day,” says one online prepper guide published last June.\u0026nbsp “You can line your toilet with plastic bags in the event of water being switched off and dispose of the contents away from your house.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialTheresa May, of course, has said members of the public do not need to stockpile and should take “reassurance and comfort” from her government’s official preparations for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.The boundless idiocy of our politicians has made me a Brexit prepperThe don’t panic instruction, however, does have a certain Dad’s Army feel, given the government’s seeming inability to organise a traffic jam near Dover, and its apparent willingness to rely on a ferry company with no ferries to ship in extra supplies.So how much of this Brexit prepping is sensible, and how much is alarmist overreaction?Should we be stockpiling food?“The short answer is no,” says the British Retail Consortium (BRC).This is despite the pretty chilling letter it sent to MPs on Monday warning – with the backing of supermarket chief executives – of the potential consequences of no-deal Brexit.And despite the fact that nearly one third of food consumed in the UK comes over what, for now, is a frictionless border with other EU states.For non-perishables like tins of beans, explained Andrew Opie, the consortium’s director of food and sustainability, “There is no need for consumers to buy more than normal, because stores have been increasing their supplies a little, just to make sure they are ready for the initial period after March 29.”And for perishable goods like fresh fruit and vegetables, stockpiling – by anybody – is futile.“It’s not practical or particularly safe for anyone to store them,” said Mr Opie.\u0026nbsp “If there was any obvious way in which governments or businesses could solve the fresh produce problem in a no-deal Brexit, we would do.\u0026nbsp The reality is, the solution is to avoid a no-deal Brexit.”Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing

retailers typically storing no more than two weeks’ worth of stock, others have suggested further reasons why personal stockpiling might be unwise.One food supply expert, speaking anonymously because of how sensitive Brexit has become, explained: “It’s like the fears of petrol shortages caused by the fuel protests a few years ago.\u0026nbsp People think there is a petrol shortage, so they all rush off and buy petrol, and that’s the only reason you end up with a shortage.\u0026nbsp It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.“By everyone keeping calm, you can prevent the very situation you are worried about from occurring.”Should we be stockpiling medicines?The Royal College of GPs (RCGP) says no, but not in a very reassuring way.Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, Chair of the RCGPs issued her guidance to The Independent with some pretty striking caveats.\u0026nbsp“The governing Council of the RCGP recently passed a motion to oppose Brexit and to call for a ‘People’s Vote’ on the grounds that Brexit in any form could potentially damage the NHS and patient care in a number of ways that were not made clear at the time of the initial referendum.”But having said that, she advised: “We do support the guidance that GPs should not stockpile medicines and devices at a practice-level as this has the potential to create or exacerbate shortages on a wider-scale.”“We understand that patients may be concerned about their access to medicines and devices,” she concluded, “But would ask them not to take it upon themselves to stockpile - or put their prescribing healthcare professional in a difficult position by asking them to help them to do so.”Instead, said Professor Stokes-Lampard, patients should “look to the government to reassure the public that these measures are unnecessary”.As for how that government reassurance is going, in October England’s most senior department of health official, permanent secretary Sir Chris Wormald announced publicly that maintaining supplies of essential medicines would be “very complex” in the event of no-deal.A few hours later, Theresa May insisted the department of health was working to ensure “we have plans in place” to keep medicines flowing, even in the absence of a deal.Will there be food shortages and price rises in the event of a no-deal Brexit?Almost certainly, according to the letter warning MPs about the consequences of no-deal that was sent by the BRC and the UK chief executives of: Sainsbury’s, Asda, Marks \u0026amp Spencer, the Co-Op, Waitrose, Costcutter, Lidl, Pret A Manger, KFC and McDonald’s.The letter sought to explain to MPs the disruption no-deal Brexit would cause to Britain’s just-in-time food system, where fresh, perishable produce pulled out of the ground in Spain can be on UK supermarket shelves the following day.Nearly a third of all food eaten in the UK is EU-produced, and having a no-deal Brexit in March might be particularly bad timing because in spring a huge proportion of some perishables – 90 per cent of lettuces, 80 per cent of tomatoes, 70 per cent of soft fruit – comes from mainland Europe.In this, Dover – as former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab belatedly realised - is particularly important: 38 per cent of all EU goods imports come through Dover and Folkestone.And it has been estimated that if you delay lorries at Dover for just two extra minutes, it can eventually cause tailbacks of around 30 miles.\u0026nbsp (Hence the government’s attempt, in January, to simulate a 6,000-vehicle backlog at the Port of Dover with 150 lorries, which became 89 lorries after nearly half the drivers didn’t bother to show up.)The letter stated that such delays can be expected in the event of no-deal.MPs were warned: “Even if the UK government does not undertake checks on products at the border, there will still be major disruption at Calais as the French government has said it will enforce sanitary and customs checks on exports from the EU.“Government data suggest freight trade between Calais and Dover may reduce by 87 per cent against current levels as a result.\u0026nbsp For consumers, this will reduce the availability and shelf life of many products in our stores.”As for the supermarkets – as opposed to the customers – being able to further stockpile non-perishable items: “All frozen and chilled storage is already being used and there is very little general warehousing space available in the UK.”The letter also warned that as well as there being supply difficulties, prices may be pushed up by the new WTO rules tariff regime that would follow a no-deal Brexit.Currently, the letter explained, tariffs are paid on only around 10 per cent of food imports to the UK.\u0026nbsp MPs were told that proportion would go up if the UK reverted to WTO rules, which would “greatly increase import costs, which could in turn put upward pressure on food prices.”And so, the letter from one retail consortium, seven major grocers, and three big food chains concluded: “We are extremely concerned that our customers will be among the first to experience the realities of a no-deal Brexit. We anticipate significant risks to maintaining the choice, quality and durability of food, and there will be inevitable pressure on prices.”Although when it comes to the more extreme prepper predictions, there seems to be no need to worry about the suggestion that “the UK would survive no longer than five days on internal resources in a no-deal situation.”The Independent was told it was “remarkably unlikely” that Britain would ever have to rely completely on its own internal resources: trade would not cease altogether, it would just get more complicated.We have been told that once we free ourselves from the shackles of Brussels, we will become a truly “global Britain”.\u0026nbsp Can’t we simply airlift in the necessary food from our many new trading partners around the world?Not, it seems, without the risk of significant increases in food prices.“If you have to airlift in a whole range of products,” said Mr Opie of the BRC, “It adds massively to costs.“The risk is that retailers whose margins are already incredibly squeezed can’t absorb those costs.\u0026nbsp Either they go out of business or they pass the costs on to the consumer in the form of higher prices.”Brexit: Magnums and deodorant being stockpiled in case of no-deal exitThere was, he added, another problem with ending reliance on lorry loads of EU food by air freighting everything in from all over the world.\u0026nbsp It might not be possible.“We simply don’t have the capacity to air freight everything,” said Mr Opie.“At periods of peak demand, like just before Christmas, we had 130 lorry loads of citrus imports alone coming through our ports every day.\u0026nbsp That’s just for one type of product.\u0026nbsp We can’t just switch everything to air freight.” \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspBut no-deal Brexit won’t happen, so surely no harm will have come from all this worrying about it?Just the contingency planning for no-deal is racking up massive costs, said Mr Opie.“The costs are increasing by the day,” he said.\u0026nbsp “Every day, we are having to pump money into planning, in terms of people’s time, in terms of trying to find alternative supply routes and alternative supplies.Royal College of GPsOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But if we are able to make progress sooner, then that might not be necessary.He was slapped down by Downing Street shortly afterwards,\u0026nbspwith Ms May\u0027s spokesman reiterating her commitment to leaving on 29 March.Ms McEntee said the EU was likely to approve a request to delay Brexit but she insisted that the prime minister would have to be clear on her goals.But she added: At the same time, I think there would be a very clear ask from the other member states as to what exactly it is we are trying to achieve.There is no point in looking for an extension if we end up back to the same place in three months\u0027 time.Created with Sketch.

But if we are able to make progress sooner, then that might not be necessary.“We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.”There is\u0026nbspgrowing concern\u0026nbspamong ministers that there is not enough time to pass the necessary legislation before exit day,\u0026nbspamid reports that the February recess could be cancelled to give Ms May more time to win over the EU.Mr Hunt said a solution had “not been properly worked up” to replace the\u0026nbspIrish backstop – which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\u0026nbspMPs backed a bid to\u0026nbspreplace it\u0026nbspwith “alternative arrangements” in a series of crunch votes on Tuesday.He said it was “difficult to know” if negotiations would run to the end of March, but added: “Whereas a week ago none of us really knew whether this was going to be possible, we are now in a situation where it clearly is possible.“There are lots and lots of hurdles –\u0026nbspno one is saying this isn’t going to be very challenging –\u0026nbspbut we do now have a consensus in parliament.“Providing we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.”However his Austrian counterpart, Karin Kneissl, said it would be “very difficult” for the Brexit timeframe to be extended and warned that Britain could be heading for a no-deal exit.She said: “According to the Article 50 procedures, the deadline is 29 March,\u0026nbspso there is a time pressure because what couldn’t be reached by negotiation over the last years, it’s very difficult to imagine that there can be a tremendous breakthrough – a magic solution – in the next few days in order also to have this ratified in due time for the remaining EU members.”Created with Sketch.

This will not change due to our exit from the EU.”However, the spat underlined how the dispute over the territory could still pose a serious obstacle to an orderly Brexit.Spain, which pressed its demands on Gibraltar’s status in the run-up to the agreement being signed in December, will expect the new footnote to be used in all future EU legislation regarding the UK after its departure.The UK and Gibraltar governments argue that the territory has a right to self-determination. In a 2002 referendum on sharing sovereignty with Spain, 98.9 per cent of Gibraltar voters rejected the proposal.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We are useless. Have a trophy.”And it’s a depressing cycle that will continue for as long as there are National Television Awards, live from The O.A ceremony where the categories may chop and change every year, but the stupidity remains ritualised.As well as getting all the usual winners though, viewers also had to endure a technical nightmare on Tuesday, where things went wrong — from the shambolic opening scenes right through to the unedited version of the closing credits: “With thanks to — Television Centre White City or just Television Centretoo long.”It’s always a case of fine margins, of course, at the NTAs, and the evening might have strayed into so-bad-it’s-good territorythe cameras had just focused on one of the Love Island gang when host Dermot O’Leary said: “Danny DeVito will be in Dumbo next year.”They didn’t, though. So a night bedevilled by sound issues, rotten acceptance speeches and foul Danny Dyer language was crowned by Special Recognition winner David Dimbleby eulogising the BBC and ordering us to be nicer to politicians, in a speech that could hardly be descri- bed as “mood capturing”.It’s the awards themselves though, that I know get viewers’ goats the most, starting, painful as it is to admit, with the fact perennial winners This Morning absolutely robbed Piers Morgan’s Good Morning Britain operation in the Daytime category.Given that Jack Whitehall’s Travels With My Father managed to scrape on to the Comedy shortlist, there’s also an argument that says Chunk, Charlotte Hawkins, Richard Arnold and Susanna Reid — who was styled quite magnicently on the night as Waitrose’s answer to Vicky Pattison — should have made that final five as well.Because almost no show made me laugh as loud or as regularly as Good Morning Britain did in .A glaring omission too in the TV Judge section — always won by David Walliams — which included X Factor’s Robbie Williams on the shortlist, but not Craig Revel Horwood, who didn’t take a two-week sabbatical in the middle of Strictly, cost the BBC £million or throw in his other half as part of the deal.The award that made a nonsense of the whole occasion though was Ant  Dec winning Best Presenters for the th time in a row, despite the presence of Bradley Walsh and Graham Norton on the shortlist, and the fact Ant spent far more weeks in rehab than he did in a TV studio.The mutual affection is touching in one way, of course, but it ultimately does neither them nor the NTAs any good at all and has robbed both of a glorious moment of redemption when they win the  award.Before that foregone conclusion takes place, please stay tuned to This Morning and sit tight until mid-March, when Dr Chris will be along with part II of his bottom-wiping masterclass: Flushing, FLU-SHING.Practially the only programme I watched at the weekend that wasn’t punctuated by uncontrollable sobbing fits from the participants was BBC’s landmark Holocaust documentary The Last Survivors.Men and women who are all in their late eighties and nineties now and understand that time is precious.When you’re a living part of history you also know facts are far more precious than tears.So in the words of the remarkable Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, who avoided the Auschwitz gas chamber purely because she could play the cello: “I won’t give people the pleasure of seeing my emotions.”The very least we owe all of them is an audience. The Last Survivors is available on the BBC iPlayer and will probably be the most unforgettable  minutes of television you’ll watch all year.At approximately : hours, Sunday, Gemma Collins stumbled over while Dancing On Ice.The tectonic plates groaned a little on impact, the front row scattered like ten pins and there was a surge on the national grid as several million viewers went “click, rewind, play,” then “click, rewind, play,” again.In fact, by the time I’d stopped rewinding and playing, Gemma had “bounced back,”and Piers Morgan, no doubt angling for a Le Stories interview, had claimed it was “the gutsiest thing I’ve seen on a talent show” – probably since the days Piers himself was wedged in behind the judges’ desk on Britain’s Got Talent.It was an undeniably great television moment, though.A proper face plant, with a full Klinsmann snow plough to finish.The downside, obviously, is that it’s guaranteed she’ll be back next week, when Melody, Wes, James and the others will be performing to a Fairytale theme and Gemma will be clearing the B Fettercairn to Banchory road,ITV want to find a proper use for her.Click, rewind, play.Things remain cheerful as hell on EastEnders.Alfie Moon’s car has been discovered near some clfs and a policeman has the job of breaking the most awful news imaginable to Kat and the Slaters.“Considering the location and the evidence at hand, we would suggest you prepare yourself for the worst.”Big Mo: “You understand what they’re saying ”Yes, bloody Redwater’s getting a second series. Stay strong, viewers.Celebrity Coach Trip, Roxanne Pallett: “I knew as soon as Jedward got on the coach it was going to be fun.”The One Show, Matt Baker: “If you haven’t seen The Greatest Dancer yet, watch it on the iPlayer. It’s well worth it.”And Icons, Kathleen Turner: “Charlie Chaplin used his films to try and smash social barriers.”No, Charlie Chaplin used his films to try and make people laugh.Tell the BBC to try it some time.Good Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “Every cloud. We lost the NTA, but I got a kiss off Gemma Collins.” Yeah, every cloud’s got a gigantic p***-storm.No one from Peaky Blinders bothering to turn up to the NTAs to thank: “The best fans a show could hope for.”Celebrity Coach Trip contestants Jedward ­providing the finest argument yet for theof a hard Irish border.Sheridan Smith’s accent doing the London to Doncaster trip in . seconds flat, on that Cleaning Up tosh.The Greatest Dancer’s pre-performance sob stories straying horribly close to moral blackmail territory.And E fly-on-the-wall moron Vogue Williams asking: “Is Gandhi the Dalai Lama ” in total ­ignorance of this remarkable man’s wisdom, serenity and even his landmark campaign for Dolce  Gabbana’s Light Blue fragrance . . .Martin Keown: “It should be a great spectacle, so sit back, hide behind the sofa and enjoy it.”Phil Thompson: “You never know what’s going to happen and that’s exactly what happened.”And Paul Merson: “If he was at Arsenal doing this, he wouldn’t be doing it.”.This week’s winner is the bellowing great Orca herself, Gemma Collins, and Sugar, from Total Drama Island.Sent in by Rich, of Lincolnshire.

Both are powered by an inexorable sense of self-righteousness. And both have an awful lot of experience of saying sorry.The most recent example came when Sir Nick appeared on the BBC in the wake of the furore over the death of -year-old Molly Russell.It turned out, after she was found dead in her bedroom in December , that she had been viewing material online relating to depression, self-harm and suicide — material which was shockingly easy to find.As her father Ian Russell put it bluntly: “Instagram helped kill my daughter.”Sir Nick, to his credit, said all the right things about how the firm was determined to do more. But he also made the striking claim that it is sometimes better for Facebook and Instagram to keep suicide images online, because it helps other vulnerable young people get support.This after The Sun, on Saturday, found and flagged up multiple images appearing to normalise and even romanticise suicide, all within a few clicks. Many remained published for days, and a Facebook spokesman claimed they could be beneficial to users battling mental health issues.Sir Nick says the firm is following the advice from leading experts and charities. And it may well be doing the right thing. But this is the latest example of Facebook — and other social media giants in general — only acting to tackle a problem once it becomes impossible not to.Over the past decade, social media has come to dominate our lives. The latest research from Ofcom shows internet use rocketing among children and teenagers, with friendships and social lives increasingly run through screens and phones.And it is now clear that this great move online has been accompanied, for our children, by a staggering increase in mental health problems.The situation is particularly alarming when it comes to young women. The latest NHS data found that one in four of those aged  to  report having a mental health disorder — twice the rate among boys.In  alone, one in five US girls aged between  and  suffered a major depressive episode — one in five! Suicide rates for teenage girls, according to academic Jonathan Haidt, have risen by  per cent in the US and  per cent in the UK in a decade.This isn’t just about what happens on the internet. Those having problems online often tend to be experiencing problems offline too, such as bullying, harassment or broken families.More broadly, Haidt believes the “snowflake” phenomenon reflects that “helicopter parenting” leaves children less prepared to cope with shocks and dficulty. But the internet, and social media, are very clearly intensying those problems. And the big tech firms are still playing catch-up.The traditional argument from Silicon Valley is that it’s not their job to regulate human behaviour. They add that eventhey wanted to, there is simply too much out there.They are doing their best to crack down on inappropriate content, but it’s like trying to stem the tide. Behind the scenes — they insist — thousands of people are working day and night to detect and delete messages promoting terrorism, hatred, Holocaust denial and self-harm.But this argument just doesn’t wash. It’s very clear that, in the interests of their bottom lines, many of the big social media firms have long failed to put enough resources into detecting damaging content.Researchers have shown, for example, how following the recommended links from reputable YouTube content can lead to a carnival of horrors. News reports that segue into crackpot conspiracy theories and videos for toddlers that give way to horrendous scenes of a bloodied Minnie Mouse trapped in an escalator.Every day brings new horror stories, such as rival fans of royals Kate and Meghan using the Kensington Palace Instagram to send death threats to each other. Increasingly, online hate is triggering real-le violence. The slaughter of the Rohingya Muslims in Burma was, The New York Times said, “a genocide incited on Facebook”.Part of the reason that Zuckerberg has hired Clegg is to put his house in order. Clegg has talked the right talk about changing Facebook’s culture, and in particular doing more to tackle self-harm.He even says they might start paying more tax. ButZuckerberg’s answer to “how to fix the internet” is “hire Nick Clegg”, we have still got an awfully long way to go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So I’m not bothered about no deal.Appearing as a special guest at the Tory Eurosceptic Bruges Group, Mr Stringer said: Often in discussing the European Union my colleagues use kindergarten language - they say theyre our friends, how could they not have our interests at heart .I think it misunderstands that actually the bureaucrats in Brussels are a self-interested group of people - self-interested in their own survival and perpetuating their growing power and influence across the whole of the European continent.“It also misunderstands the fact that the European Union do negotiate but they usually come to agreements at the last minute – the th hour.“And that is possible which is why it’s important to send the Prime Minister back to Brussels over the next fortnight because I think that the European Union – one can’t be certain – actually want to come to a deal.”In an ominous warning for his party he predicted Labour would lose a lot of seatsit continued to frustrate Brexit.And there would be electoral peril for the partyLabour officially backed a second referendum, the MP added.Mr Corbyn is under pressure to sack a number of Labour frontbenchers who defied his order to back the bid to delay Brexit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/tp-graphic-backstop.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eu backstop brexit nonsense","story":"Will Eurocrats cause needless ­disruption just to make a point  Would they rather see all sides suffer than watch a post-EU Britain succeed If so, what would it say about the ­organisation we are leaving Let’s take a moment to recap.Immediately after the referendum, EU officials declared they would not talk to Britain about a long-term relationship until we first agreed withdrawal terms, including a “orce payment”, rights for EU citizens and the Irish border.Britain foolishly agreed. It was ­particularly silly to discuss Ireland before the main trade talks, since the obvious way to prevent a hard border on the island is through a deep and ­comprehensive trade agreement between the UK and the EU as a whole.That, though, would have given Ireland a strong incentive to get the best possible terms for the UK, and for itself.So instead, at the end of , the EU suddenly came up with the idea of an “Irish backstop”.It wanted Britain to promise that, unless it came up with a long-term ­trading ­relationship that satisfied ­Brussels, it would stay in the customs union and leave Northern Ireland under EU regulations.Stupidly, British negotiators accepted the backstop. Wisely, our MPs did not.The backstop would mean Brussels continued to control Britain’s trade deals with non-European countries after we left.It would mean placing part of our country under permanent EU jurisdiction.MPs threw the deal out. Then something sensible happened.Leavers and Remainers began to talk directly to each other and hammered out a deal that both sides could live with.There were lots of aspects of the ­withdrawal agreement that Eurosceptics resented.They didn’t like being non- voting members for another  months.They didn’t like Euro judges continuing to rule here even after we had left.They didn’t like forking out more than billion quid in exchange for the better part of bugger all.But they were ready to make ­compromises. If the Irish ­backstop were removed, they’d swallow the rest of the withdrawal terms.On Tuesday, the House of Commons adopted this position. The EU responded with a theatrical snort of indignation.“We stand by the agreement that we have negotiated,” said Michel Barnier, the European Commission’s negotiator.“The withdrawal agreement is not ­renegotiable,” said Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission.But hang on. Juncker is simultaneously telling us thatwe alter our red lines — by, for example, agreeing to a ­permanent customs union — then the agreement could indeed be reopened.So there is plainly no technical or legal reason why the backstop could not be removed or at least time-limited.Nor, by the way, is anyone still ­pretending that, without the backstop, there will be checkpoints in Londonderry and Crossmaglen.The Irish government has confirmed that,there is no deal, it will not place any infrastructure at the border.The British Government has been saying the same all along.Barnier says there would be ways to carry out necessary checks away from the frontier.In other words, the whole row is about a border that no one is going to build anyway.It’s ­surreal. There is plainly no way the House of Commons is going to accept the backstop.It also became clear on ­Tuesday there is no majority for a ­second ­referendum, because the last thing Jeremy Corbyn wants is to have to come down on one side or the other.That leaves only two options. Either the backstop is dropped but everything  is agreed, or the backstop is lost and so is everything .From the EU’s point of view, it must surely be preferable to agree the bulk of the Withdrawal Agreement, including reciprocal citizens’ rights and the ­£billion payment, while finding an alternative way to guarantee the Irish border stays open.From Dublin’s point of view, the logic is even stronger.Insisting on the backstop risks,not a hard border, certainly more dislocation between the Republic of Ireland and the UK — the very thing the backstop is ­supposed to prevent.The EU has calculated the cost will be worse for Britain than for ­Continental states, since cross-Channel trade is ­proportionately more important for us.But, by that measure, it is more ­important still for Ireland.In private, some Continental politicians are pushing for a pragmatic outcome — one that minimises disruption and ­preserves the long-term alliance between the UK and its neighbours.You especially hear these arguments in countries that trade heavily with Britain, such as Denmark and the Netherlands.You also hear them from governments that want to ensure the rights of their citizens in Britain are guaranteed.But for Eurocrats, in particular the anti-British Martin Selmayr who has seized control of negotiations, this isn’t about finding an outcome that works.If it were, the EU could have signed a continuity deal with Britain easily.The truth is many Euro-fanatics are happy to inflict pain on the EU  ­provided they inflict even more on us.If their view prevails over that of the pragmatists, then Britain has no option but to leave without an agreement.

The people who can’t get beds in our hospitals, or a place for their kids in the local school. All the while that £billion is being spent on fabulously berserk ­projects in the developing world.To her total credit, Mordaunt has said that our current level of spending on overseas aid is unsustainable. It’s been rising every year. Due to a law passed by the coalition government, we have to spend . per cent of our income on aid to the Third World each year.So right now we spend just under £billion. And where does this money go  No less than  per cent of it is siphoned off to global outfits like that most useless of organisations, the United Nations.This is the body which sent out some dimbo Australian envoy to tick off our Government about economic policy. An organisation which elected Saudi Arabia on to its Women’s Rights Commission. An anti-Western and rabidly anti-Israeli convocation of leftie Third World thugs with chips on their shoulders.The world would be enormously improvedthe UN was shut down tomorrow. And the rest of it  Some of the stuff you wouldn’t believe. A total of £, went to a project investigating Tibetan verbs. Nope, not kidding.I would assume that “climb” was one of the verbs they were investigating. They use that a lot, over there. Thanks to our overseas aid, someone, ­somewhere is now able to say in Tibetan: “F*** me, is that a yeti  Run away!”Then there’s the £, spent on a scheme to stop Indian schoolchildren imbibing sugary drinks. India itself gives overseas aid and has an income rather bigger than our own. Where is the point Another six-figure sum was spent ­persuading Chinese people not to smoke too much — China! The second richest country in the world.Another one was to help Indian workers cool their work­stations down — this in a country which has its own space programme, for Chrissakes. So much of our money is swallowed up by useless leftie quangos and charities to keep themselves in jobs.Still more is pocketed by despots in the horrible countries they run. It is a source of corruption and dependency. It makes things worse. And when we tried to ert our overseas aid to some of the Caribbean countries stricken by hurricanes we were told we couldn’t — they were too rich!It’s a nonsense and a racket. If I thought our overseas aid, in its current form, really alleviated misery and suffering I’d be all for it. That’s why I agreed with the last secretary of state, Priti Patel, who wanted to give a decent chunk to the Israel Defence Forces, which saves a lot of lives in Syria.So my recommendation would be to end it all NOW. Divert the money into our beleaguered and creaking infrastructure. And when a tragedy occurs overseas — sure, splash the cash.Anyway, Penny — hope I’ve helped by starting the conversation. Over to you, babes.SCOTTISH politician Ross Greer has already been called a “ginger turd” by Piers Morgan, and I don’t think I can improve on that. But it’s his ignorance and stupidity that staggers – rather than his hatred for Great Britain, which is something we’re used to from north of the border.Greer described Winston Churchill as a white supremacist, a mass murderer and a racist, and likened him to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. He says he is simply challenging the “myth” of Churchill. No, Ross, you’re not.You’re just pig ignorant, with a very poor grasp of history. Of course Churchill was racist. Just about everybody was of his age at that time.If you can’t see the importance of Churchill to winning the Second World War – against REAL racists, REAL mass murderers – when Britain stood alone, then you lack all sense of context and proportion.The more I think about it, the more I reckon “ginger turd” was an understatement.HERO of the week is the excellent Rachel Riley, who has been speaking out against anti-Semitism. As a consequence, she now needs greater security when she’s doing TV’s ­Countdown.

It’s got to the point where I can’t look at my Twitter feed any more. It’s just a constant stream.”She’s pretty clear who is behind it, too.  A lot of the abuse comes from people who sign off with the hashtag JCPM.SO, Labour MP Fiona Onasanya is off to prison. Found guilty in court of lying through her teeth.But the remarkable thing is she’s still going to be paid as an MP while she’s inside. She has refused to resign her seat and so her £, salary will continue to be paid by the rest of us.If you got sent to the nick, do you think your employers would continue to pay your wages  You’d be out on your ear.

Singer Katy Perry was attacked for wearing a kimono because she isn’t Japanese.White people in the US get criticised for wearing training shoes or sporting afros – that’s appropriating black culture, apparently. Though I think it was white folks who invented training shoes. Thing is, cultural appropriation is brilliant.It’s the way we have of sharing our respective cultures.  think it’s wonderful that countries outside Europe and the US have “culturally appropriated” democracy, sanitisation, railways, computers and so on. I wish more would do the same.SOMALIA is the most corrupt country in the world, according to a list compiled by a group called Transparency International.Not a great surprise, is it  Nor to see most of the rest of Africa hogging the bottom quarter of the world table.It’s bad governance and corruption that is keeping Africa poor – not colonialism. You can tell that the compilers of the report are lefties, though. Asked what countries were becoming more corrupt recently, they named the US, Hungary and Brazil. All three have elected right-wing governments.A NEW study says that women who wear short skirts are more likely to be ­promoted.The lesson I’d take from this,I were a women, is to wear a short skirt to work.

First, EU leaders are fed up with her.She signed off on a deal with them, assured them it could get through the Commons then lost by a record margin.They are now sceptical when the British indicate that this or that change could get the deal through Parliament.Despite the passing of the Brady amendment — saying the Commons would raty the withdrawal agreementthe so-called backstop was replaced by alternative arrangements to prevent a hard border — the EU remains doubtful as to whether this is really the case.No  acknowledges that things are not easy between Mrs May and EU leaders at the moment.One member of her circle tells me they are “waiting for the anger to subside” before they head to Brussels.A well-placed European source tells me there will be “nothing tangible in two weeks”.But there is another reason, beyond their irritation, why the EU are holding off from engaging with Mrs May.They want to see what happens when the Commons next votes on Brexit, on Valentine’s Day of all days.It is expected that Yvette Cooper will bring back her amendment which would force the Government to seek an extension to Article it can not agree a deal with the EU.If Cooper is passed, then the EU could be certain that Parliament would not allow the UK to leave the EU without a deal.At that point, the EU would have little reason to offer up a signicant concession.They would know there was no danger of either short-term No Deal disruption, which would be particularly badly timed for the EU given the slow-down in the eurozone economy, or of the UK ending up pursuing a radically dferent economic course after Brexit.However,the Cooper amendment failed again, the EU would have to confront the fact that this process really might result in No Deal.They could lose a withdrawal agreement that is good for them, and the backstop would have created the very thing it is meant to avoid — the need for a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.In these circumstances, and with time ticking down, the EU would become more creative in its thinking.The hunt would be on for face-saving ways to try to salvage the agreement.This would not mean the EU would suddenly drop the backstop entirely.But it would be more open to, say, a time limit on it.With this change, the deal would stand a very decent chance of passing the Commons.I understand there is a growing body of opinion in the ERG, the most powerful Brexiteer bloc in the Tory party, that a three-year time limit for the backstop — which could be extended to five in exceptional circumstances — could be acceptable.Not all members of the ERG would take this.But enough of them probably would to make up the missing numbers with Labour MPs.Senior figures in the Government were encouraged by how many Labour MPs either abstained or voted against Cooper.They believe these MPs can be persuaded to back a deal.“There is a pool of Labour votes — and it is growing,” one Government source tells me.Getting  Labour votes for a deal now seems doable.Ministers and MPs must hang tight.Now would be the worst moment to weaken the UK’s negotiating position.“I DON’T know who has got any idea,” one leading Cabinet minister tells me when I ask what Theresa May’s plan is.The precise direction of the Government’s Brexit policy is still being debated. I am told “there is no set course”.Inside the Cabinet, the arguments are far from over.There are four Cabinet ministers – David Gauke, Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and Philip Hammond – who won’t even contemplate No Deal.They are becoming increasingly outspoken in their warnings about it.This group has no intention of piping down.However, another set of Cabinet ministers are more worried about no Brexit than No Deal.One of them tells me: “The most disastrous thing for us as a party isBrexit doesn’t happen.”Another minister tells me: “The battle is only going to intensy.”But this gang of four is not as influential as they once were.The key figure from the formerly Remain wing of the Cabinet is David Lidington, effectively May’s deputy.“Liders is in the engine room. Hammond and Rudd are shouting from the sidelines,” one Tory insider tells me.Lidington is, I understand, of the view that the cross-party talks could yield something on customs.The idea would be that the UK would leave the common commercial policy, allowing it to do its own trade deals, but seek to develop a customs arrangement with the EU that would replicate other parts of the customs union.If there is a deal, the big question is how does it get through the Commons One Cabinet minister tells me that they think Mrs May should make clear before the next vote thather deal is defeated she would request a six-month extension to Article .This Secretary of State believes it would squeeze the Tory Brexit ultras, making them choose between Mrs May’s deal and a Brexit delay.THE Labour Party is about to embark on a series of ideologically driven deselections – which is all the more reason for the Tories not to do the same.Political parties must be broad churches to succeed andthe Tories set about deselecting everyone who takes a dferent view on how to achieve Brexit, they will risk turning themselves into an overly narrow faction.For this reason, local Tories should stop thinking about deselecting Nick Boles.He is wrong on ruling out No Deal, but he is right on housing and a whole host of other issues the Conservatives need to do more on.TENSIONS are mounting inside Government about the role of Olly Robbins, the PM’s chief Brexit adviser.Robbins was, I’m told, deeply irritated by reports about potential changes to the UK negotiating team.But, as one insider points out to me, there is a problem with Robbins going back to Brussels.His professional pride means he is highly sceptical about whether there’s a better deal to be done.The second problem is that this is now all about what deal will get through Parliament.But Robbins, as a civil servant, understandably doesn’t have a finger-tip feel for that.Mrs May should be relying on politicians to do this most delicate of renegotiations.In response to a request from the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the Chief Medical Officer has drawn up the first Government guidelines on social media usage.This advice is clearly sensible.If these social media companies want to demonstrate some responsibility, they should start introducing a two-hour cut-off for all users under .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead, women tell themselves they should have been more attentive, or more ­attractive, or better in bed.This week the once queen of the TV jungle, Vicky Pattison, admitted she was wracked with self-doubt after her now former fiancé John Noble “cheated” on her.She even said sadly thatshe was “thinner” he might have remained faithful. This made my blood run cold.It’s typical that poor Vicky chose to shoulder the responsibility for his infidelity by not being “perfect” enough, instead of directing her anger at his betrayal. Noble was spotted with a string of young women on nights out and Vicky felt publicly humiliated and betrayed.One minute she was engaged to be married and planning her wedding. Then it all broke down and she was left in floods of tears. In order to salvage some pride, she decided to break up with Noble.Vicky really thought she had met her soulmate but, instead, it turned out he was just another man she couldn’t trust. She’s utterly devastated, but it’s infuriating her first ­reaction was not to think he’s a swine and cheat but that, somehow, she was the one to blame.Now, Vicky is a smart, feisty young woman and I’m sure she realises she was being very silly to imagine that being a few pounds lighter would have changed anything. But on some level she convinced herself she wasn’t good enough for Noble. Of course,it was the other way around it would be a dferent story.Noble proved he was a man-child, a commitment-phobe and clearly in no way ready to settle down. In these days of social media, he must surely have known thathe was chatting up other girls it would end up all over Twitter and Facebook and Vicky would discover what he was up to.Former Geordie Shore star Vicky says Noble claims he was set up in the photographs taken of him canoodling with a iety of young women, but he has expressed no remorse to her for his behaviour. He hasn’t apologised for breaking Vicky’s heart though he has been back in touch to ask for her engagement ring back.Vicky revealed that he hinted the split was actually her fault and, with her self-esteem and confidence at an all-time low, she actually believed him. His actions in those nightclubs would appear to be those of someone who wants to be found out, or perhaps he is just supremely arrogant.Anyway, I think Vicky has dodged a bullet. It’s painful and raw right now but, one day, she will realise she actually had a lucky escape. Whatthey had gone ahead with the wedding and a few years, and maybe a couple of kids down the line, he turned out to be a serial adulterer Vicky is a strong girl and will bounce back from this devastating experience. I hope her next ­relationship gives her a happy ever after ending. Butit goes awry again, she must not blame herself.And nor should any woman let down by her partner.ALL credit to Peter and Emily Andre, who have provided stability for their own children as well as Peter’s older son and daughter from his marriage to Katie Price.“The Pricey”, as Katie insists in calling herself, has been through tough times dealing with her mum’s terminal illness as well as some truly disastrous relationships.She might appear to be a cartoon character, but she should not be treated as a figure of ridicule. Despite the bold front, I reckon Katie is a mass of anxieties and insecurities and she is very vulnerable right now.I’m sure she is very grateful to her ex and especially to Emily for their support. I hope she takes time out of the public eye and gets her le back on track.I WAS heartened this week by the positive reaction to a married couple who are planning a family together, but whose circumstances mean that their only real option is surrogacy.So many wished trans couple Hannah and Jake Graf well in their quest – some even offered their services as a surrogate. They are a trailblazing man and we and role models who have helped young trans men and women in tough times.Hannah, was the highest ranking transgender soldier in the Army, and was awarded the MBE in the New Years Honours List.While actor and filmmaker Jake stars in Colette with Keira Knightley. Dominic West, who also stars in Colette, recommended that Hannah should take over from Daniel Craig as the first female James Bond.She thought this was flattering and hilarious, but reckons Jake would do a great job in the role. I am so very fond of both of them and in awe of their positivity. Their baby will be lucky to have such kind, loving parents.RIGHT everyone, you know what to do. Vote for Ernest Shackleton as the most influential person of the th century on Tuesday night’s BBC live show of Icons. My all-time hero is up against formidable opposition including Nelson Mandela, Dr Martin Luther King, Alan Turing, Pablo Picasso and David Bowie.Shackleton, the famous polar explorer also known as “The Boss”, was at his best when ­confronted by impossible odds, so I’m hopeful he can pull this off.When his ship, The Endurance, was crushed in the ice , Shackleton somehow ­managed to get all his men to ­Elephant Island in rowing boats.He then made the epic -mile voyage to South Georgia, where he climbed over uncharted mountains, to finally get his crew rescued. I was lucky enough to follow in his footsteps and re-enact that journey, then to pay my respects to The Boss at his graveside in South Georgia, right.If you don’t know his story then check out his book, South, or download the astonishingly good Channel  drama, Shackleton, starring Kenneth Branagh. And don’t forget to vote on Tuesday for this truly iconic ­British hero.BY all accounts, the Michael Jackson documentary Leaving Neverland, ­ which focuses on two men who say they were abused by the star as youngsters, is extremely disturbing and dficult to watch. If the allegations are true, then those who enabled such vile behaviour should be brought to account.Of course, Jackson is not here to defend himself, and he was found innocent of similar charges in a  court case, but the rumours have never gone away.No one wants to believe such actions could have been committed by the pop genius, whose music is still the songbook of many people’s lives. His fans remain loyal and will not entertain the thought that he might have committed any crimes.I feel sorry for his kids, especially daughter Paris, who is rumoured to have entered rehab again due to the stress and upset over the documentary.I can’t imagine how tough this is for a woman who loved her dad, but I suspect we will never really know what went on – and those on either side of the fence will never change their minds.TENNIS ace Andy Murray shared rather more than he meant to when he posted an X-ray of his hip after an operation to relieve the pain of an injury that has all but ended his career.The eagle-eyed ­– and mucky-minded – spotted there was an interestingappendage that drew the eye.Andy, above, might not be able to play tennis at the highest level any more, but he could easily take up snooker with that thing and become a world champion.IT emerged yesterday that all staff at the maternity hospital where Kate had her three babies have been told not to take any leave in April.That would suggest that after talking to her sister in law, Meghan has changed her mind about a home birth.So we will, after all, get that photo on the steps of the Lindo Wing of yet another proud royal mum looking as though she has just stepped off a catwalk.No wonder Meghan is hugging her baby bump so tightly.She knows the little one will be blinded by flashbulbs almost from the moment of emerging from the womb.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Dr Lee used the wire loop to scrape the rest of the bulbous, rubbery skin from his nose.He added: [Dr Lee] showed me the mirror and I could tell right away that things were changing.Even this little bit that shes done today — the results are amazing.

According to police, a woman walking her dog past the play area in Newham, east London was alerted to the shivering baby when she heard her cries at .pm. Georgina Player, , who lives around the corner from the play area in East Ham said: The police came knocking at midnight to tell us what happened. They said she was only -minutes-old when she was found - she even still had her umbilical cord.   Shes at Newham Hospital and Im going to go there this afternoon to drop some things off for her - babygrows, milk, anything. I feel so bad for the little thing. She was left in a towel and plastic bag on the ground, next to the bench - not even on it. The police had snfer dogs trying to find a blood trail but they couldnt, which makes me ask how she left in that state. Although it was dark, a lot of people pass through here. You have to walk past to get to the buses. I wish she knocked on the door for help but I think she knew someone would find the baby. Grandmother Rima Zvaliauskiene, , who found the baby, told The Sun she heard a crying noise from a Sainsburys bag for le. She went to investigate, thinking the noise was from an animal. Rima said: “She was crying for her le. The baby saved herself.” Her son Ovidijus, who lives just  yards away, rushed to help. He said the infant looked purple and was cold to the touch. The -year-old added: I would say it was inhumane, to do such a thing, to leave a baby like that. Slwek Pelka, , was walking his German shepherd through the play area just  minutes before the baby was found. He said: Its crazy to think I was there just before, it was totally empty apart from a man sitting on the bench.  When the police and ambulance came, I thought maybe he had died. It was very cold and snowing. A -year-old mother living opposite the empty playground said: I saw the ambulance and police arrive and paramedics running and holding a baby wrapped in a towel. At first I thought it was a stabbing and I was terried. I was the only one in the house with my baby. They blocked off the whole area. It was freezing. It was snowing really heavily. It is really upsetting. She didnt have to leave the baby in the snow and cold, she could have left her on my doorstep and rang the bell. A -year-old grandmother added: My neighbour thinks the poor woman might have given birth there. I really feel for her. She must have been so distressed and she did the best she could. She will have known the playground gets busy and someone will have found her. Police confirmed that the baby girl is recovering in an east London hospital and her condition is now stable.   A police spokesman said: She has been unofficially referred to as Roman after the road where she was found, a small children play area on Roman Road. The child was discovered by a woman walking her dog with her children after she heard the child cry. When found they alerted the emergency services immediately. There were no other people present. She was found next to a park bench, not hidden. The child was discovered in a shopping bag in a white towel on the floor. Shane Clarke of the north east command unit said: We are growing increasingly concerned for your welfare and I urge you to make contact either with police, your local hospital or GP surgery. It is really important that we know that you are safe. I would also urge anyone who has information that could help us to reunite this baby with her mother to come forward.

You can walk down the road and be on the beach in three minutes, which is really handy for anyone that enjoys surfing. It might appeal to someone looking to relocate for a lestyle change or early retirement or it may be someone looking for a second home. Its an exceptionally nice place, the owners have been there about  years and brought their children up there but are now downsizing. I think Newquay went through a period of perhaps marketing itself to the wrong people, but in the last few years it has come up again and is hugely desirable now.

The couple heard how the Bristol charity One helps sex workers with an van that takes them food, condoms, advice and even blankets and hot water bottles.   As they were shown the food bags being prepared in the programme’s kitchen, the Duchess suddenly said: “Oh actually do you have a Sharpie marker  I have an idea. “I saw this project this woman had started somewhere in the States on a school lunch programme. “On each of the bananas she wrote an affirmation, to make the kids feel really, like, empowered. It was the most incredible idea – this small gesture.” Armed with a marker, and with the words “I am in charge of the banana messaging!” she wrote a series of messages on the bananas destined for the food bags sent out on the outreach van including “You are special”.   Afterwards a volunteer called Sam who is a former sex worker said: “I can imagine being on the van, and ‘Meghan wrote this thing, and what ’ I think they might not eat it. I think that banana would be at home until it is rotten. Because I would do the same. “It sounds really cheesy, but little things like that when you are out – especially tonight, we can see the weather – just to get that little thing… Meghan took her time out to write that one. It’s lush.” Sam, , - not her real name said the couple’s visit was “amazing”. She said: “It is amazing that they chose to come here. It is heartwarming, and makes you think that these women are not forgotten and not cared about.” She told them how the charity had helped her in the past. “I was a service user, and One was there for me when I had no-one. They helped me keep my children, helped me keep a house.” Now, she said she was volunteering for a project which helps women who have quit the le on the streets.   “They helped me move on, and now I am trying to do the same for other women.” “Us women can be forgotten. They seemed to get that. That was lovely.” Sam, originally from the north of England said she was “groomed into prostitution from  or ”. Praising the help she received from the charity, she sad: “I ended up in Bristol, addicted to drugs. I was working in Bristol, and came across One on the outreach van. I started going to the drop-in.

Suddenly I felt an agonising pain in my bum, it felt like it was on fire.  I didnt realise what had happened yet, as I was in and out of consciousness. When the paramedics arrived and tried to remove Rebeccas shorts to check the damage to her bum the fabric had melted into her skin. An ambulance took her to hospital then an hour later she was transferred to a specialist burns unit at Queen Victoria Hospital in Tunbridge Wells, Kent. Rebeccas mum Elaine Petherick, , a carer, her fiance Ben Weston, , a plasterer, and her son Joshua, seven, rushed to the hospital to be by her side. Rebecca said: The doctors gave morphine for the pain, but it wasnt working so I was hysterical. Doctors told me that I had suffered third-degree burns and would be scarred for le.  Every time nurses dressed my wounds twice a day, it felt like they were stabbing me. I was too afraid to look at it in the mirror, I told the nurses I wasnt ready to see it yet. I couldnt sit down, I was forced to lay on my side and my stomach. It wasnt until a few weeks later when I built up the courage to look in the mirror at the damage. All the skin had burned off and there was horrible blisters everywhere. It was the most sickening sight, I was mortied. Doctors told Rebecca that she needed a skin graft and that they planned to take the skin from her leg once her cast was off. A month later in October , Rebecca underwent her first skin graft but, to her horror, it became infected a week later.   Rebecca said: The doctors needed to remove the infected skin and wait for it to heal. The pain was so intense that I was put under general anaesthetic while they cleaned the wound. I couldnt believe I was stuck in hospital again, it had taken over my le. When I ed home two weeks later, I struggled to look after my son Joshua because it was too painful to walk. Three months later in January , Rebecca finally had her second skin graft. Thankfully, it was a success. She says: I was so over the moon. Now today, my bum has healed, and it looks so much better. But the scar has really affected my confidence. I no longer wear bikinis or shorts. I still have horrible flashbacks of that day, it will haunt me forever. Anything that involves heat, like taking a hot bath, makes me panic. Ive even started counselling because of what happened. However, Im lucky that Ben has been so supportive. My scar doesnt bother him at all, it just goes to prove beauty is only skin deep.

Claire Granville, , knew something was wrong when her newborn daughter Matilda suddenly refused to feed from her left breast. But she never could have imagined that it could have been anything so serious as cancer.Puzzled by her daughter’s refusal, Mrs Granville went to see her doctor who referred her for tests which showed that she was suffering from breast cancer. She had a massive ten centimetre cancerous tumour sitting just behind her left nipple - exactly where Matilda had refused to feed from. Now thanks to her swt diagnosis, doctors were able to give her chemotherapy in time, and she has managed to beat the disease. Miss Granville, a nurse, who lives in Hull with partner Mark Wright, said: It was as though she had literally snfed it out and was refused to go near it. I thought it was such a strange reaction. She was fine feeding from my right breast, it was just the left one that she wouldn’t go near. She would turn her head away from it as soon as I held her near. It was uncanny to see her reaction to it like that, and it was only because she had done that that I went to see the doctor and it was diagnosed. By refusing to feed from my breast, Matilda has ended up saving my le. Mrs Granville, a nurse, was thrilled when she was pregnant with her third baby. She was already a mother to Jacob, , and Amelie, ten. When she gave birth to Matilda she started to breastfeed her as she had done with her other two children and at first, Matilda fed happily from both sides. But in April , at  months old, she she suddenly refused to feed from the left side. She examined herself and felt a lump there and went to see her GP.  Cold Feet star Fay Ripley shares the lessons shes learnt - and reveals her one regret  Mrs Granville said: The GP said not to worry about it, as they were sure it was nothing.I said I was sure there was something wrong because my baby wouldn’t drink from that side. So they said that they would refer me for an ultrasound just to to reassure me.But when doctors carried out the tests, they discovered she had a ten centimetre tumour behind her left nipple. She said: I was so shocked that I had breast cancer. I knew there must be something wrong for Matilda to refuse to feed from it, but I was so young to have breast cancer. It’s a frightening diagnosis to get when you are the mother of three children. Mrs Granville had an operation to remove her left breast, following by six rounds of aggressive chemotherapy and radiotherapy too.Doctors discovered it had already spread to  of her  lymph nodes, so it was vital that she’d had the treatment when she did. She finally finished her treatment in January when doctors gave her the all clear, and she was able to ring the bell on the hospital ward to signy the end of her battle. She said: It was a very emotional day when I rang the bell. Everyone is rooting for you, so to be able to ring it like that is an amazing feeling. I’ve heard that animals can sense when their owners have cancer, and it was as though Matilda could sense it in me too.There was a reason why she wouldn’t feed, and I’m so glad I trusted her instinct that something was wrong. Because I was able to get treatment swtly, then it meant that my treatment has been successful. If I hadn’t listened to Matilda then it may have been too late when I was treated. It had already started spreading when I was diagnosed. One day when she’d older I’ll tell her how she has ended up saving my le."},{"url":null,"title":"nurse tells tragic stories child","story":"NewsThe Language of Kindness: A nurses story of the child patients who moved her to tearsEXCLUSIVE: Christie Watson, who became a nurse at just , has written a memoir of some of her most touching and distressing memories in her fieldShareCommentsByRachael BletchlyOliver Milne:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB News\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen Christie Watson took up nursing at the age of  she spent a lot of time shycrying.She cried when she messed up her first injection and when a patient suffering schizophrenia became violent as she took his blood pressure . She wept when she saw her first dead body and, after witnessing a dramatic birth, sobbed so hard her student unorm collar was soaked with tears. But after two decades working in mental health, paediatrics, neonatal care, AE and ICU, Christie’s tears dried up. She says: “I was becoming emotionally numb to quite shocking events. I thought I’d got compassion fatigue.You become harder with every bit of cruelty you witness and I coped by shydeveloping a sick, sarcastic sense of humour. “But there was always a patient who’d remind you of someone you loved and open you up again.” Many of those patients feature in Christie’s best-selling memoir, The Language of Kindness, A Nurse’s Story.  It’s a poignant, powerful and shyemotional account of her -year career, but also a timely reminder of the sacrices made by her shycolleagues on today’s front line. Christie, , says nurses are facing “a perfect storm” of challenges that threaten the future of the profession and the NHS. She adds: “It is shyunbearably hard for nurses today. “They are the most undervalued of all professions and morale is lower than ever. We’re , nurses short in England alone, applications have dropped because the Government scrapped the bursary which paid for their training. “Nurses will be qualying with massive debts and harder to keep in the profession. So who is going to deliver the NHS’s  Year Plan  “The NHS is not failing. Nurses are not failing. They are BEING FAILED.” Christie, from London, is a single mum to two children aged  and . She came off the nursing register last year and now writes full time and fights for staff as Patron of the Royal College of Nursing Foundation. In her book, she recalls some of the patients who left a lasting impression... especially the youngest ones. Here are just three of their stories. Charlottes story Two-year-old Charlotte has shymeningococcal sepsis . It can kill a child within hours. She is en route to the PICU [paediatric intensive care unit] and we get everything ready. She arrives on a trolley covered in tubes already, a ventilator at her head end and a monitor by her feet. Charlotte has no blood pressure. It is impossible to cannulate her, as her veins are too dficult to find.  Her leg is cold and pale, like a twig from a dying tree. We manage to resuscitate Charlotte and attach her to even more machines. But the purple rash has spread. I know when I hand over, long after my sht should have ended, it is unlikely that Charlotte will be there in the morning. She’ll need three nurses just to care for her and she’ll probably lose her almost completely dead and purple legs, and possibly her arms, too. Children as sick as Charlotte have such a profound physiological shycompensatory response to illness that they shut down any part of their body that is non-essential. Charlotte has kept her blood for her vital organs and has taken everything she can from her limbs. But Charlotte is not done yet. Her body is fighting internally as much as our machines are fighting externally. This will to survive, this powerful and physical defiance of death, is one of the reasons I’ve always loved working in children’s intensive care. Still, before I leave, one of the doctors says: “We might need to amputate. Get the surgical team up here. It might save her, might not.” I look at the nurse taking over from me, who will likely hold shyCharlotte’s leg as it is cut off on the ward. She is fairly junior and already this week has had to pull a mother off a child who died, the mother trying desperately to give him chest compressions after the team had stopped. The surgeon will come and remove Charlotte’s leg. Then leave. The amazing paediatric intensive care doctors will spend  minutes explaining what is happening, and why, to the family. Then leave. The nurse will hold Charlotte’s leg as it is being cut off. Then she will sit with Charlotte’s parents through the entire night, performing her nursing tasks, as they ask her a million questions... “Is she in pain  Will she walk  Can she hear me  Is she dying ”  Charlotte should have died a hundred times over. She loses her legs and her fingertips. The extent of her illness is beyond the capabilities of our shytechnology. Yet she survives. And Charlotte’s will to survive lts all of us. It is easier to do the job with shychildren like her. Easy to find the energy to be kind and to care, to prioritise, as do all nurse-parents at times, another child – a stranger – over our own. And when Charlotte comes back to see us two years later, toddling on shyprosthetic limbs, smiling, looking well, holding her mum’s hand and chocolates for the nurses, we all stop whatever we are doing and crowd around. I think of all the sunsets Charlotte will get to see. The golden skies. “Thank you,” her parents repeat over and over again. “Thank you.” And I suddenly feel. I feel so deeply that I have to hold my breath. Charlotte is truly alive, and so am I. Tommys story Tommy does not want to see the sun. He closes his eyes whenever I open the curtains, and screws his face up tightly. Tommy is nine years old and shyparalysed from the neck down, following a road traffic accident. I look after Tommy for many shyconsecutive nights over many months. Twelve-and-a-half hours when it’s often simply me and him. Tommy has spiky black hair, which his dad puts gel in every morning. Next to his bed is a small table with a photograph of Tommy, his mum, dad and cousins on holiday, drinking through long curly straws from coconuts. I wonder what he was like before. I provide all this physical care for Tommy, but it is his mind that needs nursing most of all. We talk through feelings. ‘I am not surprised,’ I tell him, when he mouths that he wants to go home. ‘I think I would feel the same. You must really miss the time before the accident.’ I understand his desire to go home is a desire to travel back in time to his old le. He is not talking about a physical home. I read to Tommy that night, and many others when he can’t sleep, his eyes open too wide in the near-darkness. We read Harry Potter and, as the story develops, his eyes close a little: he escapes a fraction. He requires ventilating, his broken neck means he can no longer breathe unaided. He has such complex needs that it may take many months before he gets out, years even before he gets to his physical home. I listen to his mum and wonder how on earth she will cope when Tommy’s dad is working away. She also suffers with depression.   Tommy’s th birthday arrives while he is on the ward. The nurses decorate his bed space with tinsel leftover from Christmas, stick up cards and balloons. But under the stark lights of the shyintensive care ward everything – even le – seems articial. Tracy, one of the nurses, brings in some flowers from her garden. Tommy looks at them but then closes his eyes. Tracy loves him. She talks to him all day, as she washes him, rubs cream into his skin, stretches his legs out, the radio in the background. She dances, terribly, punching her hands in the air. It is the only time I see Tommy laugh. There is a mound of presents at the bottom of Tommy’s bed and his dad has a large sack of gts when he walks in. “There’s the birthday boy.” He kisses Tommy’s face and they smile at one another. He starts pulling out presents one by one and piling them on the bed until Tommy is wide-eyed. When Tommy falls asleep his parents stay on the ward. “He wanted a bike,” his mum says. “I always promised him that he’d get one on his th birthday”. Her body folds in half. She holds her stomach. “I’m so sorry,” I say. The tears I am holding in burn my eyes. Tommy’s dad puts his arm around her and squeezes. “It’s temporary. He’s a fighter,” he says. “I know he’ll walk again. I just know it, love. Doctors get things wrong all the time.” He looks over at Tommy, who’s asleep surrounded by equipment and machinery. Then he turns to me and nods that slow nod you do when you want someone to agree with you. But all I can do is push my razor blade tears even further back and fake a smile. I look away, and focus on Tracy’s wild flowers. Jasmins story Jasmin is a -year-old girl on a ventilator, following a house fire. Her hair smells so strongly of smoke that we are reluctant to allow her family to see her. Jasmin’s brother lies a few beds away, also on a ventilator but weaning off it, less sick, stronger. Their mother is dead. Jasmin is sedated and dying, but her aunt is now waiting to come in and see her. The ward’s usual smell of antiseptic has been replaced with that of fire. Nurses cover their mouths and noses with gauze swabs. Someone asks for theatre masks. We cannot make things any better for that poor family, but smelling the lingering smoke will surely make it worse for Jasmin’s aunt.  Sometimes not making it worse is all we can do. Jasmin is so sick that it is dangerous to move her at all. But I hold her head very carefully, as my colleague Nadia washes her hair as best she can. That smell will stay with me for ever. It enters my nostrils and rests somewhere much deeper in my memory. As I hold Jasmin, I feel a change. Nothing changes on the monitor. The ventilator does not alarm. But Jasmin has changed. She feels lighter in my hands – something has shted. Her head is a feather. I look up at Nadia, who is looking back at me and we both understand Jasmin has died. We do not move for a few seconds. Take a pause. Then we both go back to the task, Nadia pulling a thick combthrough Jasmin’s soapy hair, tipping water gently over her. I hold Jasmin’s head, letting the blackened water fall between my fingers to the plastic bucket we’ve put underneath us. I take the bucket to the sluice and tip it away, and the smell of smoke fills me up once more. I close my eyes and envisage the block of flats: Jasmin and her brother sharing a room, and their mum trying desperately to get to them. I hear screaming. Smell fire. I push tears back, make my stomach hard. It is not a time for me to cry.   The priest is half an hour away. There is no time to wait. I discuss what we can do, for Jasmin’s aunt. She does not ask about my faith, but instead about my experience. ‘Have you done it before ’. Jasmin is not the first child I have christened. We keep some holy water in the PICU in case a child is dying, the parents have not yet christened them and the priest is unlikely to make it in time. I find myself putting my fingers in the water and making a cross on Jasmin’s head. If there is a God, he will surely forgive me, I tell myself. Patients like Jasmin stay with me for ever. I carry the smell of smoke. Extracted from The Language of Kindness by Christie Watson, published by Vintage at pound..copy Christie Watson .

Next week it is expected Chief Medical Officer Sally Davies will issue guidance to parents about encouraging their children to exercise or play after tech-time. The Department of Health have reportedly stressed Dame Sally will not propose a daily cap on the amount of time children use such technology. She is however expected to point towards a possible ‘association’ between social media use and mental ill health, before calling for more research into the issue.  It comes after an academic blamed Instagram for the suicide of her -year-old daughter and father Ian Russell revealed his daughter Molly, who took her own le at , looked at images glorying self harm on the social media site.When Matt Hancock replaced Mr Hunt as Health Secretary, he asked Dame Sally to fast-track her findings and come up with guidance that could become a ‘norm in society’, similar to the recommended maximum alcohol consumption for adults. In October, he said: Unrestricted use of social media by younger children risks being very damaging to their mental health. It comes as the schools minister Nick Gibb said Mobile phones should be banned from classrooms. Mr Gibb said he had concerns about the impact that excessive phone use was having on children, and said the Government would introduce lessons for pupils on how to limit their screen time.   Speaking to The Times, Mr Gibb said: Schools obviously are free to set their own behaviour policies but my own view is that schools should ban mobile telephones and smartphones inside school, and particularly inside classrooms. I believe very strongly that children should be limiting their own use at home. Every hour spent online and on a smartphone is an hour less talking to family, and its an hour less exercise and its an hour less sleep. And of course it is a lack of sleep that research is showing can have a damaging effect on a childs mental health.

The Duke, , made sure to stop and chat to the adorable nursery school children who gathered waving flags to meet the prince and his we Meghan, .Meghan giggled: They are very good at waving flags. Harry was also heard joking to the nursery staff about how they keep them all under control. He mischievously added to the youngsters: You know you guys can run anywhere you like  as he bent down to check they werent too cold. However, some of the three and four-year-olds from Abbeywood Tots appeared to be more excited by their snack of digestive biscuits than their brush with royalty. Harry later asked: Are you nice and warm in here  as he admired one of the children’s snowsuits.  Meanwhile, he also shook several of the youngsters hands and did funny impression.Nursery worker India Leachman, , said after the meet and greet: “The children beckoned them over, like ‘we’re excited to see you’, waving their flags and as soon as they came over, they were interested in their biscuits. “They looked very interested in all the children and making sure they were warm and thanked them for coming out.” The Duchess also stopped to admire one little girl’s plastic tiara and princess dress, which she wore under a zipped up snowsuit. The couple, who travelled  miles from Kensington Palace, were greeted by a winter wonderland after the area was hit by flurries overnight. They were forced to cancel their plans to fly because of the bad weather and arrived in Bristol by train, about half an hour later than planned. Meghan wrapped up warm in a pound, silk-chfon midi Oscar de la Renta dress, vintage William coat and pound olive leather boots by designer Sarah Flint.  She teamed the outfit with a matching olive clutch bag that she took to Prince Louiss christening. And she appeared to be wearing her pound -karat gold Pippa Small Herkimer diamond stud earrings that she was spotted in at Princess Eugenies wedding.Harry looked dapper in a jumper and blazer.Although they had been delayed, the pair were met with a warm welcome by throngs of well-wishers - including students off school because of the weather - eager to catch a glimpse of the VIP visitors. Meghan told fans: We tried our best to get here fast. She later apologised and said Sorry my hand is cold.  One member of the public told Meghan how her now-defunt blog The Tig had been an inspiration to her. The Duchess also chatted to another fan about yoga and how it was relaxing for the mind, body and soul. She added: A nice practice would be so fantastic right now. All hands were on deck before they arrived to grit roads and try and make the slippery, slushy streets safe. The aim of todays royal engagement was to learn more about the citys cultural history and visit organisations supporting communities most in need. Police earlier revealed they had stepped up security and put up barriers to keep crowds at bay. Chief Supt Ian Wylie, from Avon and Somerset Police, said: Of course the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are the A-listers of the Royal Family and it will attract lots and lots of visitors. As well as the politan Police royal protection officers, well have many of our own local officers supporting.   The visit began with Meghan and Harry being taken on a guided tour of the Bristol Old Vic theatre, which recently underwent a multi-million pound restoration. While there, the Duchess spoke to the children about the benefit of arts and theatre extracurricular activities as a creative outlet. Some of the children then performed an extract of Shakespeare play King Lear before Harry and Meghan unveiled a plaque.The Bristol Old Vic was built in  and has a unique place in British theatre history having nurtured the talents of countless famous actors from Daniel Day-Lewis and Greta Scacchi to Peter OToole and Jeremy Irons.   The internal layout has been transformed, with the restoration of the Georgian Coopers Hall, a new studio theatre created in the old barrel vaults and mezzanine galleries. The project is the second stage of a -year pound million programme to completely overhaul and safeguard the future of the theatre. As the couple left the Bristol Old Vic a member of the crowd shouted: Harry can you take these flowers to which the Prince ran and got them.Obviously they are for my we and not me, he said as he thanked the woman and ed to the car.The pair also visited Empire Fighting Chance, a charity using boxing to support children failing at school and in danger of drting into a le of unemployment or even crime.   Two pairs of personalised black and white boxing gloves baring their names in gold were waiting for the couple as a gt.They met young people using the gym, spoke to coaches about the positive impact boxing is having on Bristols youngsters, and watched a couple of training sessions attended by primary and secondary school pupils. The couple then head to One, a charity specialising in helping women to break free from street sex work, addiction and other le-controlling issues.

Iestyn from Kingswood near Bristol said: “It just got a bit emotional because he mentioned something. He knew some stuff about me and the same thing happened to me.

The charity, based in a former sports centre that was earmarked for closure in  when Bristol City Council was forced to embark on budget cuts, is funded by a mixture of Lottery money, corporate sponsorship, grants, and the charges it levies on schools for pupils using its facilities.   The charity was started in  by Martin Bisp and Jamie Sanigar after they spotted two youths dealing drugs outside their boxing club in the nearby neighbourhood of St Paul’s and invited then into box to get them out of trouble. “Within six weeks we had  kids coming in twice a week,” Mr Bisp said. They now run programmes for  young men and women per week combining non-contact boxing with therapy, numeracy classes, and other courses designed to instil discipline, self control, and respect while building self confidence and improving physical and mental health.

Turning to Mason, Ms Lubbock added: We feel that your role in this incident and the subsequent uploading was more serious and more of a senior role. Giving the pair community orders she remarked: This is a lesson to both of you. You have been humiliated in the court of social media. British Transport Police were contacted when another gay man reported the video had been uploaded on February  last year. In the three-minute journey Mason and Mullan, who calls himself Toby on a male escort site went through a full range of sex activities.   Mason, who goes by the stage name HungYoungBrit, openly advertises his pornographic activity on his Twitter page and is hoping to earn himself an award in Americas porn industry. The BBC interviewed Mason over his Chav porn career which he called his calling, as he was pictured in a national football kit for England. The pair appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court to be sentenced today for outraging public decency. Mason, who is also a landlord, entered the dock wearing black suit and tie while Mullan wore a white shirt and pink tie. They spoke to confirm their identities and guilty pleas. The court heard the pair had been in a relationship but were not when they filmed the sex. They had spent the day together in north London before deciding to head to Masons home in Southwark, South London. Robert Simpson, prosecuting, said: The two men in the dock engaged in ious sexual acts in a tube train including full anal, and oral sex and masturbation and this was in the presence of the travelling public. The incident was recorded by them and the video of what happened was subsequently uploaded on to Twitter where another gay man saw it and thought it had crossed the line of what was acceptable, and the incident was reported to the police.  The Twitter account was traced back to Mason by the British Transport Police. Speaking about Masons account Mr Simpson said: It is not for the vicars tea party. Tweets unearthed by prosecutors reveal Mason advertising his outrageous behaviour: Full on live sex in front of general public on subway train. t is outrageously horny we could not stop ourselves  per cent genuine footage. Howard Cohen, defending both, told the court the orgy was not planned and the section of the front carriage of tube where they were having sex was empty. He also argued Masons twitter was only available on the adult part of Twitter. He added: Mr Mason works in an industry, the adult content provider industry, which involves him taking footage of ordinary members of the public to gather background material for material later posted online. Mason, of Aberfeldy House, Brandon Estate, South London, was given an -month community order and fined pound, with court costs of pound. Mullan of Castlehume Gardens, Belfast, was handed a -month community order and required to pay court costs of pound.

Nicole, , and Matthew Ziesemer, , had only just been introduced to daughter Blakeley when doctors realised the new mum was still in labour. Medics caring for Nicole spotted another head during a post-birth clean up and baby Cade was born  minutes later. During her pregnancy, Nicole only had one scan - the day she went into labour. And it is thought Cabe was not spotted as he was hiding behind his sister. Nicole, from Grand Haven, Michigan, US, is now home and delighted with the two new additions to her family. The -year-old, who worked in insurance before becoming a mum, said: It was crazy. We were over the moon but it utter shock. There were really no signs that I was carrying more than one baby, in fact people said how small I was. We thought the biggest surprise was going to be the sex of the baby, little did we know. It was really scary when they said that something  was inside me.  She continued: And when they told us that it was another baby I literally asked hershe was lying. I just couldnt take it all in and was still in so much pain that it was almost impossible to process. But I really cant imagine having just one baby now. Its like they were meant to be. I love the thought that theyll always have each other. Nicole planned a natural home birth with just a midwe present but had to go to the nearest hospital - Gerber Memorial, Michigan - when her waters broke at just  weeks The new mum - who had severe morning sickness throughout the pregnancy - decided to forgo painkillers in favour of breathing exercises, a yoga ball and cool showers. She did not have any scans throughout her pregnancy, apart from one on the day her waters broke, because she wanted a natural pregnancy. But after being in labour for over  hours, the expectant mum opted for an epidural and a suction.   Blakeley arrived two hours later at .pm on December  weighing lbs oz. But doctors grew worried as instead of the pain subsiding, Nicole was still in agony after the delivery. They were due to stitch Nicoles vagina up but realised something  was in there, Nicole said. While medics were trying to retrieve her placenta, it became clear something was not quite right and decided to do an emergency ultrasound. Nicole gave birth again  minutes later, to a baby boy, weighing lbs. Baby Cade, who was having dficulty breathing on his own, was rushed straight off to nearby Spectrum Hospital, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA.   Nicole, who stayed with her daughter, said: Over the next few days my husband was primarily with Cade while my daughter and I stayed in for observations. We were still reeling from the shock and just trying to get our heads around it all. But primarily all we wanted was for them both to be strong and healthy. The craziest thing is that on the day I went into labour I did have a scan but it only picked up the one baby. They think that Cade must have been hiding right behind his sister. When they were allowed home the couple, who met online in , went shopping for duplicates of all the baby equipment they had previously purchased for just one.  Matt, a chiropractor, and Nicole have since been told that twins and triplets run in her side of the family. She said: It was amazing to hear that its a bit of a family tradition, my grandmas cousins apparently had twins and triplets. People do ask uswe were to have another baby would we have scans this time  but I honestly dont think we would. Unless there were any clear medical red flags, Id do it just the same all over again. Matt added: It was truly was just such a surreal moment. I could not believe that my we was carrying two children that entire time. My we does an amazing job with the two of them. I really dont know how she does it all day every day.

Koku Istambulova, a survivor of Stalin’s repressions, would have turned  in June, according to accepted pension records in Russia. She was older than a woman listed in the Russian Book of Records who died last month supposedly aged , officials believed. Koku made headlines last year by saying she had never lived a single happy day in her long le. Her grandson Iliyas Abubakarov said she had supper as usual on Sunday, January  at her village home in Chechnya.   “She was joking, she was talking,” he said. “Then she suddenly felt unwell, she complained of a chest pain.“We called the doctor, we were told that her blood pressure had dropped, and injections were made.“But they failed to save her. She died in a quiet way, fully conscious, praying.” She has been buried in her home village Bratskoe, survived by five grandchildren and  great grandchildren. A Muslim who was born before the last Tsar Nicholas II was crowned, she outlived the Soviet Union by a generation, according to her internal Russian passport. Her date of birth was claimed to be  June  - when Queen Victoria was on the throne in Britain. But her passport gave only a year of her birth, not the exact day and month.   In extraordinary and moving testimony broadcast last year she spoke emotionally of the appalling day her native Chechen people were deported en masse by Stalin to the steppes of Kazakhstan  years ago. She told how people died in the cattle-truck trains - and their bodies were thrown out of the carriages to be eaten by hungry dogs. If her age was correct, Koku was  at the time, having earlier lived through the coronation of the last tsar Nicholas II two days before her th birthday - and his toppling when she was . “It was a bad day, cold and gloomy,” she said of the February morning in  when the entire entire nation was banished from their mountain homeland in the Trans-Causacus. “We were put in a train and taken … no one knew where. “Railway carriages were stuffed with people - dirt, rubbish, excrement was everywhere.” Stressing the cruelty of Stalin’s action, she told journalists determinedly in her native Chechen language: “Write that - there was excrement in the carriages.   “We were not allowed [to go] anywhere.” Young Caucasus girls died because from the rupturing of their bladders - they were ashamed to go to the toilet in crowded stinking the crowded trains. Older women tried to crowd round them to stop their embarrassment as they relieved themselves. Yet there was worse. “On the way to our exile, dead bodies were just thrown out of the train,” she said. “Nobody was allowed to bury the dead. “Corpses were eaten by dogs. My father-in-law was thrown out of the train in this way.” A paranoid Stalin had alleged the Chechens were collaborating with the Nazis. “We were told that we were bad people and thats why we had to leave,” she said. Before the war, she recalled “scary” Nazi tanks passing her family home. She suffered devastating personal bereavements in her Kazakh hell - her two sons both perished in the harsh conditions. “There were no doctors, no-one to treat them,” she said. “My younger boy came down with something and passed away really quickly.   Such things happened in every family. “When women gave birth children often died because there were no obstetricians, only neighbours and friends.” Weeping the old lady said: “I only kept my daughter Tamara.” She was exiled in Kazakhstan for  years then, after Stalin’s death, people were allowed toto their homeland. When she got back, many houses had been grabbed by incoming Russians - so she set to work building her own home, complaining her husband was too lazy for the work. She conceded that despite her earlier claim, the day she moved into her own house, built with her own hands, after ing from internal Soviet exile was “happy”. “I built it myself, the best house in the world,” she said. “I lived there for  years.” Asked about the secret of going le, she previously said: “It was God’s will. “I did nothing to make it happen. “I see people going in for sports, eating something special, keeping themselves fit, but I have no idea how I lived until now.” Her recipe for a long le was fermented milk, but she shunned meat and soup. She asked: Why did Allah give me such a long le and so little happiness .... “I would have been dead long ago,not for Allah who was holding me in his arms.” Koku said: “It is hard to live when all who remembered you died long ago. And it is very scary to die, however old you are.” The oldest documented human was Jeanne Calment, from France, who lived  years,  days, dying in . French scientists have dismissed a recent claim from Russian researchers who argued she assumed the identity of her dead daughter and was not as old as records show.

They’ve two games to come against County and one final crack at Ayr and, of those showdowns, two are at Tannadice.Yes, the two heaviest defeats of the season came there against County and Ayr but under Neilson that second defeat was the only one he’s suffered in seven home games so far.And last time he sent out a team to face County he did mastermind what was without doubt the best win of the campaign to date, a gritty - success on their patch, in November.If the manager can mould his rebuilt team over the next few weeks, wins like that one can be repeated.They’ll have to be, or United’s big-game failures will see them negotiating even more vital outings in the play-offs."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-take-an-extra-14-minutes-to-get-out-of-bed-on-cold-mornings","story":"Chilly winter mornings lead usto spend an extra  hoursin bed over the colder months - just from hitting the snooze button."},{"url":null,"title":"singer-tom-walker-to-perform-surprise-gig-on-busy-glasgow-street","story":"SINGER Tom Walker is to play a special performance in Glasgow city centre tomorrow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-maternity-infection-source-may-never-be-known","story":"THEsource of an infection that contributed to the deaths of two premature babies in a hospital intensive care unit may never be known, NHS chiefs have said."},{"url":null,"title":"customers-overpaying-for-unused-mobile-data-7-ways-to-avoid-it","story":"MOST mobile customers on SIM-only deals are overpaying for unused data, Citizens Advice has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-lennon-described-as-magnificent-human-being-by-irvine-welsh-after-exit-from-hibs","story":"Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh has showed his support for Neil Lennon."},{"url":null,"title":"council-bosses-could-change-plans-for-free-nursery-places-helping-10000-families","story":"UP TO , families could benefit from new council plans to increase access to free childcare."},{"url":null,"title":"cab-driver-hauled-before-licensing-committee-to-explain-speeding-ticket","story":"A CAB driver was pulled over by police for speeding as he tried to reach his pregnant we."},{"url":null,"title":"judy-murray-takes-on-role-with-kiltwalk","story":"JUDY Murray has been appointed a trustee of Britainrsquos fastest growing charity event, the Kiltwalk."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-toljan-sold-on-celtic-after-youtube-barcelona-highlights","story":"Jeremy Toljan has revealed that Celticrsquos European adventures swung his decision to make a deadline day loan switch to the club."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-blow-as-tom-rogic-out-out-valencia-game","story":"Celtic have been dealt another injury blow with Tom Rogic ruled out of this months Europa League tie against Valencia.

especially in this weather, she said.ldquoEvery parent that sends their child to school by bus is depending on the council to ensure that happens safely.ldquoIt is the councilrsquos responsibility as corporate parent to ensure these children get to school safely.A spokeswoman for Stagecoach North Scotland said: ldquoSince we started operating the additional school contracts on January  there have been some issues with capacity we have identied and are working to resolve.ldquoWe are working closely with Highland Council to resolve these problems by issuing school children with passes allocating them to specic buses to prevent the overloading problems we have seen.She added that in terms of the issues raised by Mrs Paterson an additional bus is now running to and from Croy.Saturday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119409.jpg","title":"Site for Inverness homes not acceptable","story":"Councillor Ken Gowans hit out at the application by agent Bracewell-Stirling for DMPM Services.He said the site was not zoned for housing and would pile pressure on local school rolls which are already well over  per cent capacity.ldquoWhile we need more affordable houses, any development must be part of the local plan, and this development is not.ldquoThis is likely to generate more unacceptable pressures on infrastructure which is already struggling to cope at the moment.ldquoWhile developers pay contributions towards education, it doesnrsquot change the fact that local schools are beyond full, and the councilrsquos school roll projections indicate these will worsen in the short to medium term, he said.Highlands MSP and road safety campaigner David Stewart also expressed some concern: ldquoI am mindful that the dual A will be at one side of this site and the rural B road will extend along another side of the site.ldquoAs it stands, this particular road has no pavement for pedestrians and this would be an issue that would cause me concern.Saturday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117111.jpg","title":"Work starts on new outlets at Eastgate Shopping Centre","story":"WORK has begun at the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness to develop four food outlets.The units, suitable for restaurant or bar operators, are being created by the reconfiguration of two existing shops fronting Falcon Square.Burger King UK is the first operator to sign up while talks are ongoing with operators for the other units.In addition, a new kiosk will be created fronting the Falcon Square mall entrance.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending.

Quick-thinking Lewis, along with pal Lauren Kennedy, sounded the alarm, got Nan to safety and dampened the fire with towels before the fire brigade arrived at the scene.Lewis told the Ayrshire Post : “The whole night was a blur.“We were driving back from work and I saw a fire in the window. “I was chapping on the door and ringing the doorbell. “The full house was covered in black smoke. “I couldn’t see anything. “I didn’t know how long the firemen were going to take and the house was still on fire so I thought I needed to do something. “Nan was shook up about it. “I was trying to get into the kitchen because Nan said there were towels at the washing machine. “They were pretty damp so I just threw them over it. “After we put the fire out, we sat on the wall and waited for thefiremen. They had a big extractor fan and they were trying to get all the smoke out.“It had even got upstairs, the firefighters said.” Nan was upstairs sleeping at the time unaware as to what was going on. She said: “I wondered what it was. “I could hear the doorbell and by this time the smoke alarm kicked in. “Luckily I woke and came down the stairs and there was my hero at the door. “Buthe hadn’t of been here I would’ve been a goner with the smoke alone. “Even now, anything you touch you’re covered in black soot. “I was in a state of shock. “The table caught fire and the windowsill. “I had to go to the doctor two or three days later because I kept wheezing.” Daughter Lesley Watson, , added: “It could’ve been so much worse –Lewis just caught it in time. “If that young man hadn’t been passing, she wouldn’t be here today.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13938225.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS165962684.jpg","title":"driver who sped 70mph through","story":"NewsDriver who sped at mph through streets of Troon is jailed for  monthsMark Kirkby almost killed his passenger when he finally crashed into a wall following the high speed chase.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB NewsMark Kirkby was jailed for the reckless driving\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man who drove like a maniac through the streets of Troon has been jailed for  months, writes Edwin Lawrence. Mark Kirkby, , almost killed passenger Kerrie Anne Monaghan when he finally crashed into a wall. Miss Monaghan was in Ayr Sherf Court on crutches to hear the sentence on her partner, who she is standing by. The court heard Kirkby did not even have a driving licence and Sherf John Montgomery banned him from holding one for four years. Depute fiscal Lindsay Bain told the court police spotted a silver Volvo being driven erratically from Barassie Street into Portland Street. The police car’s blue lights went on and Kirkby initially slowed down before increasing speed. He was hitting mph in Templehill before heading into Harbour Road. And Kirkby’s car was said to have taken off as he drove across a mini roundabout into Port Ranald Drive. He hit mph in North Shore Road, eventually crashing into a wall at the Beach Road Kilmarnock Road junction in Barassie. During the whole episode, which began around .am on October  last year, Kirkby drove dangerously through junctions and swerved round corners.  When the crash occurred the car’s airbags were deployed but this did not prevent Ms Monaghan’s horric injuries. She had to be cut out of the car by firefighters and suffered numerous fractures to her face, head, body and limbs. “Kerrie Anne Monaghan is very lucky to be alive,” said fiscal Ms Bain. The court also heard of offences committed by Kirkbywhose address was given as Barlinnie Prison, on June . This time he was in a grey Ford Mondeo around .am when police spotted the car stationary on the A near the Pennyburn Roundabout. Kirkby was unsteady on his feet and slurring his speech, although a breath test proved negative. A a blood test found substances identied as cocaine and benzocaine. Defence lawyer Hugh Duncan said Kirkby’s relationship with Ms Monaghan was still ongoing. “He accepts full responsibility,” said the lawyer. “He comes across as remorseful to the injuries his partner suffered and to potential harm he could have done to others.” Mr Duncan said Kirkby had been remanded in custody since October , had undergone a detox programme, and had come to a realisation of his mental health issues. Sherf John Montgomery told Kirkby: “You drove dangerously at high speed for an extended period. I see no option but a custodial sentence.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnHMP BarlinnieVolvoAyrCourtsJusticeTroon"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article11461688.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/ymr_ayp_141112Elliots_02.jpg","title":"elliots prestwick evolve rebrand vics","story":"NewsElliots in Prestwick to \"evolve\" with rebrand as Vics  The VineBosses at Buzzworks say the bar and restaurant must \"evolve\" as part of its transformation.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  FEB NewsBuzzworks managing director, Kenny Blair, is promising bold changes at Elliots \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne of Ayrshire’s biggest hospitality venues has closed for a “complete transformation”.

Danielle Smith, , used a metal pole to shatter windows of a home on Ness Glen Road, Dalmellington on November , .

Almost every window in the home had been smashed and holes in the windows were consistent with shots of the rle. Blood smears were spotted on the living room window. Police were called and discovered the metal pole used by Smith the following morning. A search warrant in Smith’s home uncovered pellets for an air rle in a box within her bedroom.

However, it has a narrow focus in terms of local taxation.ldquoGiven the consultation only concluded last Friday, it is surprising that the Scottish Government were able to announce the tourist tax today.The new deal with the Scottish Greens includes an extra poundm for the core local government settlement, a move to three-year local authority budgets and legislation that will give councils control over tourism taxes.The deal also includes raising the council tax cap, meaning local authorities will now be able to increase council tax by .%, up from %.Fellow Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell, also leader of the councilrsquos Scottish national party opposition group , said: ldquoSignicant announcements have been made on a phased development of alternatives to the council tax. ldquoAlthough I donrsquot advocate that locally we should immediately take advantage of the proposal to give local authorities power to introduce a tourist tax, or the suggested workplace parking levy, these are adjustments that some Scottish city authorities will want to take up after the necessary legislation is approved.ldquoI am also pleased that talks on meaningful alternatives to council tax will restart and that with a three-year funding settlement, as opposed to the current one-year deals, there will be more clarity for local authorities on future funding.ldquoThere are also small changes in the - revenue grants for local authorities. Despite the constant chant of despair from the Bordersrsquo Tories, I said all along that the December announcements of funding for the council were only provisional. ldquoThe Conservatives who lead the council like to highlight that we were told we might see pound.m less for core revenue funding next year, conveniently forgetting to talk about promised money for new services such as the massive expansion in early learning and childcare.ldquoThey also omit to tell Borderers that we are getting poundm more next year as capital funding, almost exactly offsetting the change in revenue funding.ldquoWe must wait until the detail of the poundm package from the Scottish Government is analysed by officers, but my provisional calculation is that the new funding announcements could give the council more than pound.m, meaning that we will see a clear cash increase in next yearrsquos funding for core revenue and capital.ldquoSadly, we are being told that the Conservatives in Holyrood may vote against these welcome changes.Rachael Hamilton, Conservative MSP for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire, said: ldquoThanks to the SNP, Scots across the country are about to be hit by a triple tax bombshell.ldquoThis budget not only taxes aspiration but taxes people for driving to work, which is quite frankly ridiculous in a constituency like mine, where travelling by car is essential.ldquoWe will pay the highest income taxes in the UK, council tax could go up and now you might even be taxed hundreds of pounds a year for taking your car to work.ldquoThe SNP have run out of ideas on how to grow and expand the economy.

They have at their disposal expensive advertising and marketing which hugely influence our choices and purchasing habits.,params: .pushHowever, Galashiels councillor Harry Scott felt the proposals amounted to unwelcome government meddling with personal choice, saying: ldquoIrsquom not in agreement with any of the proposals in this paper. I appreciate the problem, but this is typical nanny state, dictating to us how we should live our lives.ldquoIt will cause unnecessary restrictions on business, specialist retailers will find it hard to market themselves, and I doubt very much whether it will have any impact on the groups it is targeting.ldquoWhilst Irsquom very much in favour of labelling food to make clearer to the consumers whatrsquos in it, in principle I am against compulsion. People have to take responsibility for their own lives and lestyle choices, and as long as you keep within the law, the state should have no place in telling you what you can eat or drink.A motion put forward by Mr Scott called for the response to be completely rejected, but it was not supported by his fellow councillors.Instead, they opted to vote to submit the consultation response in full, albeit as a council officer response not as a political response.According to NHS Health Scotland, in , % of Scotlandrsquos children were at risk of becoming overweight and % were at risk of becoming obese.

large ldquoscrapes of empty ground, effective for boosting the marsh clubmoss.English lowland heaths were once well used for grazing livestock and collecting gorse for firewood, heather for thatch, bracken for bedding and sand and gravel for building.This activity created trampled trackways, exposed sandy patches and shallow pools which were a haven for wildflowers and other wildle, and the team

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

plantations, agriculture and lack of habitat management, with only fragments remaining.The team behind the project said marsh clubmoss thrives on bare wet ground created by disturbance such as grazing animals or tracks.So a dramatic decision was made to deliberately drive over thousands of plants in a five-tonne tractor.Sophie Lake, co-project manager, said:ldquoWe knew that many heathland plants benefit from signicant disturbance but there was a sharp intake of breath when we took the decision to drive up and down over a beautul colony of , plants in a five-tonne tractor brandishing a muck

effective for boosting the marsh clubmoss.English lowland heaths were once well used for grazing livestock and collecting gorse for firewood, heather for thatch, bracken for bedding and sand and gravel for building.This activity created trampled trackways, exposed sandy patches and shallow pools which were a haven for wildflowers and other wildle, and the team are attempting to recreate and

However, the advice from officers and consultants is that signicant questions remain about the deliverability of the current tram-train option, particularly in relation to capacity at Central Station.ldquoAs a result, the Executive Steering Group has agreed additional work should be done to establish an alternative Outline Business Case for a Personal Rapid Transitoption.ldquoThis work was not advanced by the previous City Deal Cabinet, but it is now crucial in order to allow us to make a fully-informed choice about which of the options in front of us should be progressed.:Glasgow Airport rail link saga has dragged on for far too longldquoI remain committed to a solution that delivers improved public transport connectivity to Glasgow Airport - but I am determined it should also provide value for money for the city, and deliver the widest possible inclusive economic benefits.ldquoIrsquom confident we have made signicant progress towards that outcome today.Glasgow Airport said congestion on the M means action is needed and ldquodoing nothing is not an option.Mark Johnston, managing director at Glasgow Airport, said: ldquoWe were informed that, due to issues around rail capacity, the project partners are developing an alternative option.: Half a million to go on addressing airport rail link fearsldquoThis will be evaluated and we will, of course, work with the partners to promote the delivery of an effective solution within the agreed timescale.It has been understood that transport officials were not keen on progressing the tram-train link from Glasgow Central to the airport.Michael Matheson, Transport Secretary, said: ldquoItrsquos crucial that improving access to Glasgow Airport is balanced with the needs of the regionrsquos existing transport network.ldquoThe Personal Rapid Transit system option potentially meets this aim, and I look forward to seeing the revised business case once itrsquos completed."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9335824.jpg?type=article-full","title":"make-2019-your-year-with-these-positive-goals","story":"Volunteer GlasgowThere are s of volunteering opportunities in Glasgow looking for people like you to help.Evidence shows that people who volunteer are healthier, happier and more employable.

I still have many of the books I bought with pocket money when I was young, carried through le like a lucky charm. TS Eliotrsquos Prufrock may have measured out his le with coffee spoons I have measured out mine with Puffins and King Penguins, Peregrines and Pelicans. If pressed, I could tell where I found each one.Like radio, the demise of the book has been often foretold. Books, we were unreliably informed, were yesterdayrsquos technology, so th century, so redundant in a digital age. I well recall the gleeful obituaries. The internet would sweep them away with tsunami-like ferocity. Kindles, apparently, were the future, and even I owned one once. Who knows where it lies unloved now. And who cares Similar prophesies of doom were made about bookshops, for what need was there for themno one wanted books  And for a while things did look a bit glum. With the demise of the Net Book Agreement, which determined that books must be sold at their cover price, many privately-owned bookshops found they couldnrsquot compete with the discounts offered by supermarkets and chain stores. Inevitably, sadly, some went to the wall or sold out to more voracious competitors.Of late, however, in what has been the bleakest of midwinters for the high street, there are signs that reports of the death of the bookshop were premature. In the last couple of weeks, I have heard of two new bookshops opening in Edinburgh. And last Saturday evening, I attended a mini book festival in Linlithgow, organised by the local independent, Far From the Madding Crowd, which was very well-attended, a testimony to the loyalty and warmth the shop engenders.The best bookshops are like that. When one of them is threatened it is a cause for mourning and resentment and the raising of petitions. For me, a town without a bookshop is unworthy of the name, a place where civilisation is yet to reach, where culture must surely fail to thrive. I have been in such outposts and nothing would drag me back.Where there is at least one bookshop there is hope. A year ago, I visited Christchurch in New Zealand, which is still struggling to recover from the devastating earthquakes of  and . The centre of the city was preternaturally quiet and the shopping mall was bereft of customers. But the one shop that was buzzing was Scorpio Books, also independently owned, which against all odds had managed to resurrect itself. Would the same, brave decision have been made by the fund managers who control chain stores  Perhaps. Then again, perhaps not.One of the new Edinburgh shops will be Toppingrsquos, which has a wonderful branch in St Andrews. The companyrsquos founder is Robert Topping, formerly of Waterstonersquos in Manchester, which he left after being told to limit the size of the stock. The story is told in a new memoir by Glasgow-born Sir Tim Waterstone, of whom I was briefly an employee ndash the least said about which the better. ldquoThe Waterstonersquos model, recalls Sir Tim, ldquowas simply this: the highest class of heavily stocked literary bookselling run on a national scale by an unusually enthusiastic and highly knowledgeable young staff.Waterstonersquos was born in  when the book trade was in dire of need of modernisation. Complacent, rival shops kept short hours and unsatisfying stock, and their staff were more inclined to turn custom away than welcome it. Waterstonersquos ndash which was in the vanguard of Sunday opening ndash initiated a bookselling revolution and played an intrinsic role in making the literary novel cool. In the store in which I worked, on any given night you might catch a reading by Gore Vidal, Richard Ford, Raymond Carver or Edna OrsquoBrien. It was like a club of which anyone could become a member.Scratch any writer and they will regale you with tales of their favourite bookshops. I have one ndash Main Street Trading in St Boswells ndash a handful of miles from where I live in the Borders. Some prefer charity shops, others, such as my biblioholic husband, emporia like the Strand in New York with its eight miles of books. In Browse: The World in Bookshops, Ali Smith hymns Leakeyrsquos second-hand bookshop in Inverness in which I always try and spend an hour or two when Irsquom in the vicinity.

The thing thatrsquos novel is that men can do this for themselves at home and do not have to go to a clinic as was the case with previous trials.Mr Anderson said: ldquoIt allows a couple to have a discussion about sharing the load.

When he was Prime Minister, James Callaghan ndash as his then son-in-law Peter Jay injudiciously revealed ndash saw himself as Moses, leading his people through the wilderness. Theresa May is even less likely casting in that role, but yoursquoll remember that Exodus had  chapters, and wersquore still quite near the beginning, perhaps round about the stage in the story where people threaten to smite the borders with frogs. Lamentations will come later on.Unfortunately, while Exodus had the most reliable author possible, wersquore getting a narrative on which no one ndash even its authors ndash agrees. The votes this week, for example, were hailed by politicians and commentators as killing off the withdrawal agreement, giving it another stab, fatally undermining it, showing a way to fix it, making no deal less likely, making no deal almost certain, improving the chances of the EU offering concessions, encouraging the EU not to sht an inch, and anything  you can imagine.It would have been a good deal more honest to say, we donrsquot know. Which is, alas, what we ought to say to most of the suggestions for how Brexit might play out. Still, some aspects of the story are possibly a little clearer, and some future developments in the plot more likely than others.I have no idea, and nor does anyone , whether the EU will make any signicant changes to the withdrawal agreement, which it says cannot be renegotiated. But it is the EU which said at the beginning that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and who voiced approval when Parliament insisted on having its say in the deal. Bearing that in mind, the fact is that the shape of a possible deal on an orderly ndash as opposed to a ldquono deal ndash exit, is very slightly clearer.Or, at least, there is a clear mandate from the Commons for what they donrsquot want: they donrsquot want to remain, they donrsquot want to extend Article  , they donrsquot want a second referendum, they donrsquot want ldquono deal, but they may be prepared to vote for Mrs Mayrsquos dealshe can secure changes to the Irish backstop.A lot of sceptics describe this set of priorities as a unicorn, meaning no such thing can exist in reality. That, I think, is to mistake what reality is. Reality includes a lot of things, including unicorns, which people imagined and then wrote down. Treaties and trade agreements ndash though this is, letrsquos not forget, not a deal about our future relationship with the EU, merely about how we leave ndash are not fixed natural features of the landscape, theyrsquore things people invent and bring into being. If it comes to that, even physical features like national borders are articially created.Those who imagined that a second vote, or simply remaining, could happen should now concede that the parliamentary arithmetic makes that a more fancul idea than some amended version of the withdrawal agreement going through. The prospect of some sane Norwegian or Swiss-style Brexit, unfortunately for those of us who hoped for that, also looks much less likely now.The same is not true of the vote disapproving of no deal in principle, however, and not just because it was advisory, and has no legal force. Itrsquos theoretically possible that ndashno adjustments are forthcoming on the backstop ndash Parliament will try to vote to call the whole thing off, or at least to delay. But given the dficulty of finding any mechanism to avoid no deal so far, itrsquos hard to see how, especially given that there are enough MPs ndash including Labour rebels, judging by the majority this week ndash who think that the political fallout of not leaving will be even worse than any disruption a no-deal Brexit might bring.Parliament, whatever inidual MPs may want or think, is clearly not prepared to imagine a hard border in Ireland. Buttheyrsquore insisting there shouldnrsquot be one, it should make it obvious that the only group arguing for this horrible prospect are the EU.The strangest aspect of the argument over the border is how seldom anyone points out that it already exists, with restrictions on goods and dferences in taxation on either side, and that there was free movement of people across it long before either Ireland or the UK joined the EU. If it becomes a more dficult border in future, it will be for one reason only: the preservation of the EUrsquos single market. Thatrsquos also, by the way, an indication that the single market is not some idealistic free trade area, but a protectionist tarf arrangement for the benefit of EU member states.The question is which of the two stories told by the Commons votes the EU chooses to listen to. One is that there is, potentially, a Commons majority for the withdrawal agreement ndash which, I should point out, is a truly terrible deal for all sorts of reasons which have nothing to do with the backstop, and probably worse than either staying in the EU or leaving without any exit deal ndash but onlythey will drop their claims to enforce and police a section of the UK indefinitely. The other message is that therersquos a narrow majority against no deal at all.That second declaration doesnrsquot strengthen the EUrsquos position in resisting any changes in what has so far been put down as much as it might like, however. There was a much bigger majority against the Cooper amendment that is, against any delay in leaving. The story could, judging by its improbable twists and turns so far, go in almost any direction now, not many of them involving a happy ending. But the only one that avoids no deal and ends this sorry chapter is rewriting the current withdrawal agreement.Read more: No  knocks back Hunts signal of possible delay to Brexit"},{"url":null,"title":"saving-the-wildcat-now-only-a-whisker-away-from-extinction","story":"But numbers have been virtually decimated because of persecution, habit fragmentation and interbreeding, leaving fewer than  remaining in the wild.Now an animal conservation charity wants to build a national wildle reintroductions centre in Scotlandrsquos largest national park in a bid to save the endangered Scottish wildcat ldquofrom the brink of extinction.The Royal Zoological Society of Scotlandwants to build the centre on land in the Cairngorms National Park as ldquoa matter of urgency for the elusive native species.Plans include a state-of-the-art breeding facility, with wildcat experts and a dedicated veterinary unit to bolster the diminishing population of the so-called Highland tiger.The RZSS says the cats would go through a ldquorigorous training regime before being released into the Scottish Highlands. The centre could also help save other threatened species, such as insects and birds.The charity, which already looks after wildcats at its existing Highland Wildle Park in the Cairngorms National Park, has now launched an appeal for donations from the public to help turn the plans in to reality.A charity spokeswoman said: ldquoMost of us yearn to catch a glimpse of the glorious Scottish wildcat, yet never do. If we donrsquot act immediately, we never will.ldquoThe wildcat is teetering on the edge. Though revered, wildcats in Scotland have been persecuted for centuries. Add to that habitat fragmentation, and interbreeding with domestic cats, and it is doubtful that their numbers in the wild now reach three figures.ldquoThe wildcatrsquos survival now hangs tenuously on a dramatic plan to create a National Wildle Reintroductions Centre, in the Cairngorms National Park.ldquoThis state-of-the-art breeding facility will bring together wildcat experts, a dedicated veterinary unit, and a specialised pre-release training programme, focusing initially on wildcats, yet with the flexibility to help other priority species in the future.The mammal is the only wild member of the cat family to survive in Britain. Although they were once found throughout mainland Britain, they have only managed to survive in Scotland. They are the same subspecies of wildcat found in continental Europe, but has been separate since the end of the last ice age around , years ago.Besides hybridisation, other threats to the population include historical and accidental persecution, disease and collisions with vehicles on roads.Although it bears a striking relationship to the tabby cat with regard to its markings, the wildcat can be recognized by its distinctive bushy tail which features black rings, a thick blunt tip, and no stripe down the middle. It also never has white feet.A breeding programme, which is co-ordinated by Scottish Wildcat Action, has been working to restore viable populations of the mammal. The last wildcat to be born in captivity was born at Chester Zoo in August. RZSS is one of multiple partners in the programme.As part of RZSSrsquos appeal, Scottish wildle filmmaker Gordon Buchanan narrated a video where he described the wildcat as ldquoBritainrsquos most threatened mammal... a totemic creature that is equally revered in Scottish culture as it is a precious part of our fauna.Mr Buchanan said: ldquoAs a matter of urgency, ambitious plans are under way to build a national wildle reintroduction centre in the Cairngorms National Park. The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland will run this state-of-the-art facility.ldquoIt will provide the perfect environment for breeding wildcats with the aim of releasing them to re-establish viable populations in key locations.ldquoThe Royal Zoological Society and their partners will use the innovative centre with its expert veterinary provision long in to the future.ldquoOver time, this could help to save other threatened mammals, birds and insects.Appealing for donations, Mr Buchanan added: ldquoScotlandrsquos wildcats are but a whisker away from extinction. Current estimates suggest there could be less than  remaining in the wild.ldquoIf we do not take immediate action, it will be too late. If we donrsquot, the fierce green fire in the eyes of the Highland tiger will be extinguished forever.To donate, visit the RZSS website."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-mps-should-not-be-representing-only-those-with-the-loudest-voices","story":"I do recognise thatmore people had actually turned out and voted to remain, the current problems would not exist. The only problem for the Tory leader would be trying to hold a fractured party together. Nothing new there. Of course people may have failed to vote for many reasons. Among them being that they did not feel that they had the information to make an informed decision of such magnitude.Personally, I believe that the \"golf club rule\" should apply to a ballot on any major change. A mere voting majority is not enough,so, apathy could rule the day. For any major change, people must actively fall in behind it. In most clubs, at least two-thirds of membersmust vote in favour of the change. So please, would Members of Parliament please try to remember what they are there for: to represent the best interests of the British people as a whole, not those in Parliament with the loudest voices.Ken Johnson,Alves, West Gates Avenue,Lochwinnoch.DUNCAN McFarlanesuggests that a second referendum would not be undemocratic, but his point that anti-Brexit leaders have tarnished their argument because their motive is for the UK to remain as part of the EU is surely wrong. He seems to be implying that Brexit is a done deal and no one should oppose it. Assuming that democracy means the will of the people, asking them to have their say on such an important decision as this is essential before stepping into the dark.To call this process a second referendum is a misnomer. The question that it would be asking would be confirmation from the electorate that its intentions for the UK to leave the EU are as they were in June . Leave yes no and If yes to Leave do you want Leave with deal no deal. Should Theresa Mays deal be taken off the table and only No Deal remains, it would be a very brave government which leads us down that road without getting confirmation of it from the people it represents.Mr McFarlane suggests that further questions such as a Norway-style deal or just staying in the single market could be added to the ballot paper. This would only serve to muddy the waters as neither is currently on the table. A confirmation of a decision such as this will only work by asking simple yes no questions that are not open to interpretation.Bill Hendry, Blackwood Road, Milngavie.OUR local MP recently insisted to me that their role is not as delegates, representing sectional interests, but to promote the national interest. His subsequent voting behaviour showed the precise opposite of this, but at least he is right in principle. The appalling self-seeking and tribalism that is evidenced by recent events in Westminster show how far Parliament has abandoned the tenets of Parliamentary democracy.It is now self-evident that there will be only two classes of beneficiaries from whatever form of Brexit occurs.

Work is due to start this year, be completed by spring  and create  jobs during the construction phase.Councillor Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness on Highland Council, said: \"While Im keen to see an improvement to the north brae, I still believe we cant take our focus off the south brae. We have two major long-term concerns to focus on here ndash the gradient of the brae and the fact that we are still witnessing serious accidents on the bottom hairpin bend even where there is an escape bed.\"These accidents are a risk to le, causing road closures and impacting in all sorts of ways on our local community and economy. Improvements to the north brae are very welcome and I hope that it is the start of a bigger vision to improve the entire Berriedale Braes.\"We can expect the standard lead-in period of about three months and for discussions to be held with the contractor on how they propose to physically approach the works and discussions with statutory bodies like the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds among others.\"He said that archaeological investigatory works have been completed.The award of the contract was also welcomed by Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce.She said: \"We are delighted to see that after many years of dedicated campaigning by the chamber, Caithness Transport Forum and other local organisations, this project is finally moving ahead. For too long, the Berriedale Braes has acted as a pinch point for travellers on the A north of Inverness, disrupting business and jeopardising investment in the region.\"It has been good to see other work on A improvements and repairs going to local companies in recent years, and we hope the principal contractor will engage closely with our highly skilled local supply chain as these works progress.\"Ms Morris added: \"Now that the contract has been formally awarded, we hope to see clarication on exact start dates and expectedof works very soon. We would urge the Scottish Government to uphold its previous promise to start works within this financial year so that the north Highlands can start to see the benefit of this upgrade as soon as possible.\"A Transport Scotland spokesman said: \"R J McLeod Ltd has been awarded the construction contract as part of the pound. million project to deliver improvements to the road alignment and the existing tight hairpin bend on the A.\"Michael Matheson, cabinet secretary for transport, hailed it as a positive development for the area. \"It will enhance the skills development of the Scottish construction industry, with approximately  jobs expected to be supported in the region during construction.\"Related articles:Four in running for Berriedale Braes contractSilence on A schemeSaturday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119387.jpg","title":"We have saved part of our identity","story":"THE Dunnet and Canisbay area would have lost part of its identityits community council had been scrapped due to boundary changes, vice-chairman Bill Mowat has said.He welcomed last weeks change of heart by Highland Council and said he was very pleased the body had been saved.Under the proposals, Dunnet and Canisbay would have been linked with Castletown and Bower community councils.Mr Mowat said the area would have lost part of its identitythe plan, which would also have seen the demise of Sinclairs Bay Community Council, went ahead.Details were reported in the John OGroat Journal last Friday.\"Community councils are of real value when you have got a single-tier council and you dont have a councillor representing the area,\" Mr Mowat said. \"We are very pleased with the outcome which is a small victory for localism.\"We are relieved we are to continue.

In addition, D photogrammetry is taking place so that digital D models of the wreck can be produced. By using these techniques, in essence, the team is able to digitally bring HMS Royal Oak to the surface.Survey organiser and licence-holder Emily Turton said: “The wreck of HMS Royal Oak is the final resting place of  men and boys. As the most intact underwater dreadnought-era battleship, she has an architectural grandeur befitting of any national memorial. However, at the smaller end of the scale, artefacts pertaining to everyday le on board are scattered around the site, bringing home the human story of those lost.

We are also very aware there needs to be some internal structural alterations.Given the urgency, the board is using its capital reserves to order the new air handling unit which is should be installed in March.ldquoIf the equipment breaks down between now and then, the pool will have to close, Mrs Manson said. ldquoSome people attend the pool on a weekly basis and that is what keeps them going. If it has to close for a number of weeks, it can make a real dference to their mobility and pain control.Retired GP Helen Charley, board chairman, said:ldquoHaving been a GP in Cromarty for  years, and having needed both hips and knees replaced, I am all too aware of how vital the Puffin Pool is to the good health and wellbeing of so many patients like me, she said.Established in  by Dr Malcolm Stevens, the pool has provided an average , sessions each year over the past four years. They are supervised by qualied supervisors and leguards.The majority of income is from its charity shop In Tulloch Street and the fees which are kept affordable for those on benefits, pensions and low incomes although these have increased by  per cent.Supporters are rallying to support the appeal and staff plan a -mile sponsored walk from Tain to Dingwall.To donate, see www.puffinpool or pop in to the pool or shop.Saturday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

A yes no vote on BID would then be held in May.Gordon McIntosh, practice manager of Munro  Noble, is a director of BID Inverness and believes the scheme can pay idends for Dingwall too.He said ldquocoach ambassadors had brought more tourists into the city, increasing spend. It meant local businesses were stakeholders in any centre development plans and have the ability to lobby the council over issues of interest. The scheme also paved the way for successful events such as classic car shows, Easter egg hunts and bar and business awards.He said: ldquoWith representatives from a cross section of businesses on the board the strong advocacy we have provided has achieved some notable results.

We have worked with local volunteers, school groups, young offenders, dementia groups, local walking groups and adult learners.In tune with the sustainable development ethos of the group, logs for Mags Wood build have been sourced locally and dragged to the site by Tarzan, a French-bred horse trained for forestry operations ndash and something of a visitor attraction in himself, hugely popular with the school groups who visit the site from time to time.The building project has been able to call on the expertise of local log building expert Henry Fosbrooke, project co-ordinator David Smith and a local volunteer, Don Fraser, who previously worked on the new Queensferry next to the Forth Road Bridge.Mr Harry said that such expertise ldquohas meant that all the measurements done are near perfect.The project has been funded by the Forestry Commission through a community grant amongst ious other sources.Mr Harry said: ldquoThis will be something special for the area and is involving many iniduals and groups in its building ndash truly a community project and something that will last a very, very long time.He is still hoping to find a supplier willing to help with the timber roof cladding required to complete the project, hopefully by the end of March.

It was commissioned in December.Dunmaglass, meanwhile, is located  miles south of Inverness and has an installed generating capacity of  megawatts from  turbines.SSE said that up to £m of the proceeds will be used to fund the share buy-back programme with the remainder used to reduce the group’s debt.The £m consideration equals to around £m per megawatts generated by the wind farms, which SSE will continue to operate.The deal is in line with the company’s strategy announced last November to sell stakes in its portfolio of onshore and offshore wind farms in order to create value from development and operation, as well as ownership, of assets.Greencoat UK Wind said it had entered into agreements to acquire the . per cent stakes in the wind farms from SSE, in partnership with the UK pension fund whose investment is managed by Greencoat Capital.

But when I was in Parliament on Tuesday, when MPs voted on a raft of Brexit amendments, it felt like many MPs were living in their very own micro-bubbles – particularly on the Labour side. There are as many Labour positions on Brexit as there are Labour MPs. Those in leave-voting seats have a tough gig. They are trying to listen to their constituents and listen to their gut instincts about what they think is best for the country. Who they are not listening to is their leader.For a man famed for such clarity on many other issues, Jeremy Corbyn has played an elusive game on Brexit. The Labour position is still unclear to many and Labour MPs have decided to do what the Fleetwood Mac song says: “You can go your own way.”Although the Labour leadership eventually supported the key Yvette Cooper amendment to delay Brexit, it was very late in the day and that sent a signal that it was a soft whip. The Labour MPs who defied the whip or abstained and helped a beleaguered Prime Minister secure that vital Brexit win won’t even get put on the naughty step.: Brexit: Ireland warning over ‘threats’ as EU rejects May’s dealLabour loyalists are relaxed about Theresa May’s victory. It’s all still a shambles, they say, which is an absolutely fair point. The Labour plan seems to be don’t block Brexit, let the Tories own the chaos, chillax until the General Election then romp home to victory. Simples!Well, not quite. Many Labour strategists seem to have forgotten that Labour cannot win a majority without winning seats in Scotland. The obsession with Labour votes in the North of England has meant that the rather large, cold place north of that has been somewhat forgotten.A large majority of people in Scotland voted to remain. Many hate austerity and want more radical, socialist economic policies but also think staying in the EU is the best option – angry Corbynistas take note, it is possible to hold those two positions and not be a traitor.Many Labour activists in Scotland have their head in their hands. They are desperately worried that Labour may end up doing a deal with Mrs May, be seen to be colluding with the Tories and being on the wrong side of the Scottish people. And Brexit is coming up the doorstep.: Brexit: Barclays given green light to transfer £bn to IrelandOne activist told me that it’s not the first thing people mention but when they get onto it, they cannot believe what is playing out in London and are following it closely. There is anger on all sides. It has confirmed the belief that the Tories don’t care about Scotland, but there is resentment and confusion about Labour’s position, especially on why it won’t support another referendum.There is, of course, one political winner in Scotland as a result of the mess in Westminster. One Labour voter summed it up: “There’s no leadership in Westminster – but at least Nicola Sturgeon is showing some.” Now this person was notan SNP or independence supporter but they were a strong remainer.Brexit could transcend party allegiances in Scotland. A two-horse race in England may well benefit Labour but in Scotland, they could find themselves once again painfully squeezed between a remain-supporting SNP and a leave-supporting Tory party.

It could see Scotland remain in a “British Union” while also signing to the European single market, according to economist Professor John McLaren. The Brexit chaos has brought home the real impact of breaking up a “closely knit economic union” and the SNP’s recognition of this is likely to resonate in a second independence campaign, a paper by the former Scottish Government adviser today states.: Tories call on SNP to ‘sever links’ with pro-indy bloggerA vote for Scottish independence could result in the same “rainbow” of future arrangements being proposed similar to those on the current “soft and hard Brexit” spectrum.“The idea of true political and economic independence in the modern age is largely an illusion,” the paper states.All official data, including the SNP’s growth Commission, makes it clear that Scotland would start out with a net deficit outside the UK of about £ billionin “fiscal transfers” for public spending it currently receives.: Claim that Brexit saps support for independence“This in turn may make it more likely that an alternative form of independence is proposed which helps ameliorate some of these impacts.”It may mean that an independent Scotland joins a “British Union” similar to the current EU model, but also signs up to the European Economic Areawhich keeps Scotland in the EU single market.Prof McLaren said: “The UK Parliaments Brexit discussions have provided a useful insight into how the next Scottish referendum may pan out. The range of possible Brexit outcomes highlights how independence is not an agreed, single, end-point but will inevitably involve a prolonged process of negotiations, with both the EU and the UK. “This leads to a much more complicated landscape for future arrangements than was perceived at the time of the first independence referendum.“The acknowledged loss of a net transfer of public funds from the UK to Scotland may also lead to greater latitude with respect to what any future political and economic relationships may look like.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4865210.1548919873!/image/image.jpg","title":"key snp figures told by nicola sturgeon to prepare for possible election","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...SNP parliamentarians have been told by Nicola Sturgeon to prepare for a possible Scottish electionthe government at Holyrood fails to pass its budget today.The Scottish Government heads into today’s vote without a deal to secure a majority, risking defeat on its spending plans for the coming year.During a meeting of the SNP group at Westminster attended by the First Minister on Monday, Ms Sturgeon warned her MPs that they should prepare for a possible Scottish election campaignthe government fails to get its budget through, The Scotsman understands.However the move comes amid speculation that Ms Sturgeon may need a fresh mandate from the electorate to secure another referendum on independence, as she prepares to reveal her plans on the issue. Publicly, the government has stated that it is focused on getting its spending plans passed and is confident of reaching a compromise.In , when an SNP minority government had its budget defeated by the Scottish Parliament, then-First Minister Alex Salmond threatened a snap election before the deadlock was broken.The current SNP minority has struck a more conciliatory tone and sought to calm speculation about an election, with Finance Secretary Derek Mackay last night appealing for MSPs to “act responsibly”.Last ditch talks are set to continue today in the final hours before a vote, with the Green Party holding out for concessions on local government spending and council tax reform.Mr Mackay must secure the support of the six Green MSPs to pass his budget, with all other opposition parties committed to voting against it.Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie has dismissed suggestions his party could bring down the government by rejecting the SNP’s budget as a “myth”.But senior Nationalist figures were openly speculating about the possibility of an election earlier in the week, with SNP committee convener Gillian Martin warning Green MSP Andy Wightman on social media that voting down the budget could force an election and put a second Scottish independence referendum at risk.“You’ve seen the way the other parties coalesce against us to try and bring down the government,” Ms Martin posted on Twitter. “Since  everything for them is about defeating the pro-Indy Parliament.”She added: “We are at risk of an election that might see pro Indy parties lose seats and put us in a weaker position.”Polls show the SNP remains in the lead in Scottish Parliament voting intention, but that the nationalists have lost ground compared with their performance in the  Holyrood election where they narrowly lost their majority.Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser claimed uncertainty around the budget showed the SNP were “unfit” for government.“The SNP has neglected the day job so badly that it’s now struggling to get the single-biggest responsibility taken care of. Nicola Sturgeon is so resigned to the weakness of her own administration, she’s been forced to rally the troops for another election.“Hers would be the first government in the history of the Scottish Parliament to call an election because it couldn’t pass a budget.“That would be a shameful legacy, and shows just how unfit the Nationalists are for government of any kind.”Scottish Liberal Democrat campaign chair Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said: “We’ve made clear to the SNP that we want a budget that focuses on education, mental health and local government funding.“If their inability to get a budget through necessitates a new Scottish Parliament election then I have every hope that people in Scotland will want to use that to eject the Nationalists.”A Labour spokesman said “no credible anti-austerity party would propose” the draft budget put forward by the SNP.With no deal last night, Mr Mackay said: “Our spending plans for the coming year contain additional money for schools and hospitals, protecting vital public services and investing in our economy, while also providing stability amid the ongoing uncertainty caused by Brexit. “With that backdrop in mind, there has never been more need for MSPs, of all parties, to act responsibly and not add to that uncertainty.”Mr Mackay added: “We are open to compromise in order to ensure we deliver the Budget that the country expects.” ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4866451.1549045584!/image/image.jpg","title":"more than 50m of the scottish government s 2019 budget to go unspent","story":"More than # million of cash in the Scottish Government#s Budget for the coming year will go unspent, it has emerged.Independent analysts at the Scottish Parliament Information Centresaid of the £ million additional cash due to Holyrood from the UK Government, £ million was remaining and would go into the Scottish reserves.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the cash should have gone to councils “to make up for years of SNP cuts”.He accused the Greens, whose six MSPs will back the Budget after reaching a deal with Finance Secretary Derek Mackay, of being “inept” in the negotiations.The Liberal Democrats refused to enter budget talks with the Government, saying they would only meet for discussionsministers pledged not to hold a second referendum on Scottish independence before May .In his amended tax and spending proposals, unveiled to the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, Mr Mackay pledged an additional £ million for local government.Overall, the Finance Secretary said his “enhanced package” would allow councils to spend up to £ million more than the original £. billion local government settlement.As well as the additional funding, authorities will also be able to raise council tax by .%, with authorities also set to get the option of introducing a tourist tax on hotel stays, as well as a levy on work place car parking.Spice confirmed that when funding ring-fenced for specic services is taken out of the equation, the amount of cash councils have control over is down by £. million.Spice also noted that of the £ million additional funding coming from Westminster under the Barnett formula, which allocates public cash across the UK, £ million would go to councils while an additional £ million would go on health.“The remaining £ million will go into the Scotland reserve,” the Spice blog stated.That prompted Mr Rennie to hit out at the Greens and their Scottish co-convener Patrick Harvie, saying they had allowed this cash to “be added to the SNP’s rainy-day fund instead of going on public services”.Mr Rennie said: “How inept for the Greens to not even be able to get all of the money that was on offer to them.“Instead they have agreed to cut adult social care by £ million.“That is an appalling attack on services that the elderly and vulnerable rely on.“This is money that the Greens and SNP should have made sure went to councils to make up for years of SNP cuts.”Mr Mackay said his - budget would result in “the most signicant empowerment of local authorities since devolution”, with additional cash going to support local services.Alison Evison, president of local government body Cosla, said the Budget deal “doesn’t mitigate all of our funding issues” and “challenges still remain” for councils.Mr Harvie claimed “real progress” had been made in reforming local taxes, with councils getting more control over council tax,powers for a transient visitor levy and a workplace parking tax.In addition to this, the Scottish Government has pledged to set up a cross-party group to look at finding an alternative to the current council tax system, which could result in legislation after the  Scottish elections.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"kalfordhame sandness shetland","story":"Offers over £,- bed bungalow for sale in Sandness.

You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

The film is a nature study that follows a young girl and her encounters in the woods over one night, having lost her way from her family campsite. It is a lyrical and delightful portrait of a child’s perspective of the natural world.Last year ATLAS installed it in the south wing of Dunvegan Castle and ran an educational workshop programme with Portree Primary School and Portree High School.This year they are hosting cross-generational screenings with primary aged girls, similar age to the young girl in the film and the elderly generation. The aim is to encourage conversation and share experiences and knowledge about their own encounters with nature.Suzy Lee, ATLAS Arts film programmer, commented: “We are really excited about working with both Portree Primary and Budhmor House to offer this screening that encourages sharing and discussion.We’ve had a great response to the film and to our extended programme, so we look forward to showing the film in a new environment.”Centre with the primary seven girls from Portree Primary.Angus Beaton, a care worker at the centre praised the event for bridging the generational gap. He said: “It was wonderful to see the younger generation interact with their regular group and to enjoy watching a film together that connected with both age groups.”Sara Matheson, Portree Primary Head Teacher said: #Our pupils have been very fortunate to benefit from the work of ATLAS Arts. Most recently our primary seven girls have taken part in film screenings of Eglantine, both at Dunvegan Castle where they were able to hear directly from Margaret Salmon, and more recently at Home Farm and Tigh Na Drochaid, where they have been able to enjoy the film in a cross-generational context.She added: #As with all projects we have been involved in with ATLAS Arts, our pupils have been impacted very positively by these experiences. We look forward to working with ATLAS Arts on some new and equally exciting future projects.#"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1408261.jpg--.jpg?1548410228000\n","title":"internationally known engineer and innovator hailed in his home town","story":" BALLYMENA’S globally recognised engineer and industrialist, Sir William Wright CBE, was honoured in his home town on Friday when he was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim.The award pays tribute to iniduals or organisations who have made an outstanding contribution to public le.The businessman and co-founder of Wrightbus was honoured at a special ceremony in front of family, friends, colleagues and special guests.Councillors proposed and agreed the award in recognition of Sir William’s contribution to global business and the local economy.Sir William Wright CBE said: “To receive the Freedom of the Borough is a great honour, particularly as it is bestowed from my birthplace, the area where my business is based, and a place I am proud to call home.“Over my letime I have had the privilege to take part in some memorable occasions and this event sits alongside the best of them.”Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor Lindsay Millar said the occasion was befitting as the work Sir William had carried out in the local economy was inspirational: “I am delighted to see so many people here today to recognise the outstanding work that Sir William has carried out over his illustrious career.“His contribution to global business and the local economy is exceptional. An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

The  album release ‘Up Among The Heather, The Scottish Album’, reflects the Scots influence on their Northern Irish roots - the album will be released on tour. Last year, their previous album ‘The Unicorn, the Continuing Story’ gave the long-awaited sequel to their famed Unicorn song.BRAID DATEBand leader, George Millar says: “In some ways it seems like yesterday, in other ways it seems a million years ago when I first met and played with Jimmy . “Neither of us had any idea what could possibly be ahead of us. Tohome and play after all these years, will be a highlight of our career and one we’re looking forward to immensely. Like the famous Bushmills Irish Whiskey, The Irish Rovers continue to improve with age and The Braid Arts Centre and Mid  East Antrim Borough Council are delighted that the boys are making a visit home to be applauded for all they have done over the years for the music industry, and for promoting this part of the world across North America and beyond. Thursday March  will see the Rovers will be performing at The Braid and they will be guests of honour at a reception where the Mid  East Antrim will welcome them home.AIR AMBULANCEAll proceeds from tickets will be donated by The Irish Rovers to the Mayors Charity Northern Ireland Air Ambulance.Another great honour for the band this year was being recognized as one of these islands greatest eacutemigreacutes by Ireland’s newest and most state of the art museum in Dublin, EPIC Ireland. Museum Director Mervyn Greene says: “The Irish Rovers are iconic, world class and with very a long career. “That’s important to us in Ireland. “They’ve truly taken Ireland with them and shown the world.As it happens, The Unicorn album is part of EPIC’s Irish Rovers installation. As young immigrants, the Rovers emigrated to Canada and became so much a part of the Canadian culture that Canada’s Prime Minister Trudeau personally asked them to become full citizens so they could officially represent Canada around the world.In , The Irish Rovers had a breakout hit with their second album, The Unicorn.That album and the ‘lucky little ditty’ of a title track written by Shel Silverstein, took them from folk clubs of America to concert halls and television sets worldwide.LAST MINUTE“The Unicorn, which was in fact a last minute add to the original album, left us all with a tear or two, plus the unanswered question, ‘Whatever happened to the Unicorns when the ark left them stranded on the shore ” says George. Since that first big hit, the band ed to the charts  more times with other songs, nevertheless, the magic of ‘The Unicorn’ remains.To pay appropriate tribute on its Gold Anniversary, the Rovers are releasing ‘The Unicorn, The Continuing Story’.It includes all new recordings, plus the sequel to the original song, which answers the question of the last fty years.A new music video also tells the story.The World Wildle Fund, and wildle cinematographer Adam Ravetch assisted in the production. Since the s, the Celtic super-group have travelled the world as musical ambassadors - with performances from as far apart as the Arctic Circle, Japan, and Germany, with regular tours to Australia, New Zealand, and the US.The Rovers first became known in the US in the s on shows like The Tonight Show, The Smothers Brothers, Mike Douglas Show, The Dating Game , and even starring in The Virginian.In the s they hosted their first of three international television series, ‘The Irish Rovers Show’ and throughout the next  years their weekly television shows brought Ireland into living rooms of America and the rest of the world.More recently, their  Drunken Sailor album went viral on YouTube, made news headlines back home in Belfast and put them back on radio across North America with a new younger generation audience.A Canadian CBC producer saw the Belfast news articles about the Rovers new song and video and asked George Millar to sing his new song ‘The Titanic’ to help their telling of the th Anniversary of Titanic. The   Years triple CD broke tour sales records, while the lads ed to the small screen with three North American television specials, ‘The Irish Rovers Home In Ireland’, ‘The Irish Rovers Christmas’, ‘The Irish Rovers LIVE on St. Patrick’s Day  th Anniversary Special’, all produced in the last few years.The days of the long tours are finally coming to an end for these Irish lads as they are now completing one last world tour.

Squinter’s been running his eye over the top-performing personalities as we hurtle towards the ration book, conscription, petrol riots and raffling oranges. Jacob Rees Mogg’s rocky road to DublinArch remainer Lord Snooty has made a fortune from providing financial services through his company, Somerset Capital Management . Thoughhe will be luxuriously insulated from the worst effects of a no-deal Brexit evenhe never worked another day in his le, he is a leading light in the fanatically anti-EU European Research Group , which makes UKIP look like the Alliance Party and which sees a Brexit crash-out as pretty much an ideal scenario. But as the Brexit negotiations descended into chaos and then high comedy, SMG decided that it was time to open two new funds in, ah, Ireland. Although Jacob is a co-founder of the company and is paid £, a month for doing eight hours work a week for the company , he said the decision to set up business in Irelandwas nothing to do with him. Asthat’s not bad enough, the company’s prospectus for the coming financial identies among the key ‘risks’ facing the business in the coming financial year is ‘Brexit’. Simply spfing, old bean.Boris and his zig-zag BrexitBack in  when Boris Johnson was still considering what outcome in the Brexit referendum would be best for him – sorry, for the country – his close pal Sir Nicholas Soamestweeted this: “Whatever my great friend Boris decides to do I know that he is NOT an outer.” But regardless of where his heart and or his head is, Boris is certainly shoulder-to-shoulder with Jacob in the vanguard of the hard Brexit storm troops. ’Twas not always thus, truth to tell. Pre-referendum Boris famously came out for Brexit in his Dailycolumn. But what people didn’t know until some time later was that Boris had written two columns that week for the : one pro-Brexit and one pro-Remain. In the pro-Remain column, which was never published in the paper, he wrote: “Shut your eyes. Hold your breath. Think of Britain. Think of the rest of the EU. Think of the future. Think of the desire of your children and your grandchildren to live and work in other European countries to sell things there, to make friends and perhaps to find partners there.” Cue soaring violins. Boris’s most recent comment on the single market was that it is “useless” In  he said in Paris: “Personally, I would like to stay in the single market. We need to stay in the council of ministers of the internal market. In my view, the British have done good things for Europe.” Google Boris’s stunned reaction when the referendum vote was announced and then remember what Nick Soames tweeted.Nigel glad to be rid of the EU Former UKIP leader and Brexit poster boy Nigel Farage has two children by his German we, Kirsten Mehr. He has told journalists that both of them support England at the football, so that’s alright then. Except they both have German passports and so, thrillingly, unlike their English neighbours, will continue to enjoy free movement throughout the EU post-Brexit. And, of course, Nigel will continue to draw his £, per year EU pension – no-one hates the EU that much, not even our Nige. Squinter was particularly moved by Nigel’s claim in the weeks leading up to the referendum that staying in Europe would “spell the end of the steel industry in this country”. But Nige and his UKIP colleagues were in  among a tiny number of MEPs to vote against a move to tighten up rules on the import of cheap non-EU steel. Business, as they say, is business. The Man from the Daily MailFormer Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre was the man responsible for all those headlines that frightened the horses during the referendum campaign and, subsequently, the attacks on Parliament and the judiciary as the political and legal implications were fought out. So he’s the Brexiter’s Brexiter. But it’s estimated that as a landowner Dacre benefited to the tune of around £, a year in EU subsidies. The veteran journalist was on over £m a year towards the end of his time with the Mail, so he’ll not be begging outside the Red Lion in his local villagethe UK leaves the EU. Brexit-voting and Mail-reading Farmer Browns, however, may be left sucking thoughtfully on a wheat stalk as they contemplate their own looming subsidy deficit, which may not be so lightly borne.Bordering on the ridiculousThe DUP’s singular focus as we hurtle towards Brexit D-Day is to block any deal that involves regulatory ergence with the mother ship – in other words: we must be treated exactly the same as Britain by the EU. Whether that’s a gentle wave goodbye with best wishes, or a massive, eye-watering boot in the ging-gangs matters not. We’re all in this together . The DUP’s insistence on alignment with the ‘mainland’ may be extremely touching, but it is an entirely new concept, for this little corner of empire long ago gave up any pretence of a claim to be as British as Finchley. Presumably, the party will continue to lobby for a dferent VAT and Passenger Duty regime post-Brexit, for they were white-hot on those ideas before the EU balloon went up. They’ll continue to block defamation law reform, keeping loyal Ulster as a magnet for libel tourists . Most famously, the DUP remains the bulwark against the equal marriage and abortion rights that are accorded to every other part of these two islands. Luckily, the party stood firm and insisted that Are Wee Country has to have exactly the same RHI regime as across the water, avoiding the possibility of widespread and catastrophically expensive abuse of the boiler scheme*Sub-editors: please check this last line for accuracy. Thanks, SquintPapers, pleaseAndrew Bridgen, Tory MP for West Leicestershireis another European Research Group charmer, without the profile of Jacob Rees Mogg but with the same level of warmth and likeability. Andy’s most notable brush with fame before Brexit thrust him into the public eye alongside Boris and Jacob was his posting of a raunchy video on a WhatsApp group composed of Tory MPs, some of them ministers. Suffice to say that the video included a scantily clad woman, a man and a sports car. A suitably repentant Andy explained to colleagues that it had been a terrible error caused by “fat fingers”. In October past he said in a radio interview that all English people are entitled to an Irish passport, a claim that nearly caused Twitter to explode and was the impetus for more jokes than Ian Paisley’s summer holidays.In response to a question on free movement between Britain and Ireland post-Brexit, Andy said: “As an English person, I do have the right to go over to Ireland and I believe that I can ask for a passport. Can’t I ” No, Andy, mate, you can’t. We’ve enough West Brits on this island, ta very much.Doctor Jekyll and Mr SnideThat Michael Gove’s a reasonable bloke, ain’t he  There he’s been for the past few months, urging cool heads and common sense, quietly and assiduously working to help Prime Minister Theresa may with a withdrawal agreement that’s harder to sell than a Northern Ireland shirt in O’Neills. While those nasty Brexit nutjobs in the ERG snarl and threaten, Michael’s been a model of loyalty and stf upper-lipped British discretion. But wait. Wasn’t it a bloke who looked exactly like him who said during the campaign that Turkey was about to join the EU, opening the gates to allow five million-plus Turks to come cascading into the UK.Yes, indeed: it was Michael Gove who made that claim. He has subsequently admitted that it was baloney and should not have been made. So them Turks stay in the mess they’re in.

An SDLP conference is scheduled to take place on February  in Newry where the party membership is set to vote on the plans.Speaking exclusively to the Andersonstown News. West Belfast Councillor Tim Attwood said he was “not an advocate of the SDLP and Fianna Fáil partnership”. It’s known that South Belfast MLA Claire Hanna is also at odds with the party leadership over its move to link up with Fianna Fáil.“I recognise that the political landscape of this island has been changed utterly given the failure of the DUP and Sinn Féin to bring back the power-sharing Executive, the catastrophic consequences of Brexit and the emerging debate about Irish unity,” said Cllr Attwood.Cllr Attwood continued: “I have the greatest respect for the leadership of the SDLP and recognise that in a post-conflict situation there is a natural and wider debate about political realignment on this island,” he said. “The reality is my politics is steadfastly rooted in the social democratic and labour traditions embodied by the SDLP and parties of the Party of European Socialists.”Mr Attwood, who has served as a West Belfast councillor these past  years, said that over the coming days he would be speaking to his family and SDLP members in his constituency area about the proposal for a new partnership between the SDLP and Fianna Fáil. “I will make a further statement after these discussions,” he added.Meanwhile, SDLP Lagan Valley MLA Pat Catney is supporting the party leadership in entering into a partnership with Fianna Fáil.Mr Catney said: “Northern Ireland is crying out for a response to the fast changing and signicant challenges across these islands as a result of Brexit. “Twenty years after the Good Friday Agreement, people here must be offered something new, credible and forward-looking in its approach.”The Lagan Valley MLA added: “Brexit has shted the political sands dramatically. It poses many challenges that sit outside the boundaries of local devolution. Our politics in the past two years, a politics of ision, of deadlock and of repetition is frighteningly at odds with the vast challenges that now face us. Old solutions to new challenges can no longer cut it.“It has always been the SDLP’s vision to unite our people. To seek an Ireland, befitting of the st century, where opportunity and prosperity are more than slogans on a placard but a way of le whether you are Catholic, Protestant or Dissenter. That will never change.“I am all too aware of the uneasiness some of my unionist neighbours may feel about this new partnership. Neighbours who have put their trust in me in countless elections. But let me be crystal clear a new Ireland, one without the full inclusivity of unionism is not one I want to be part of let alone build. You are part of the fabric of this island, woven into history every bit as much as any nationalist and you are a critical part of its future.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"fundraiser in memory of limestone mother","story":"A FUNDRAISING night will be held this Saturdayin memory of a North Belfast woman who died suddenly just two weeks after she became a grandmother for the first time.Marie Branfdied suddenly at her Limestone Road home on St Patrick’s Day  after suffering a heart attack and going into cardiac arrest. Despite efforts by her family to perform CPR, they were unable to resuscitate her.This Saturday, the mother of four’s family are holding a charity night in St Malachy’s Old Boys’ Club to raise money for British Heart Foundation Northern Ireland in her memory. The charity funds research into heart and circulatory diseases including the prevention and treatment of heart attacks.Marie’s daughter Zara said her mum had been delighted to have become a granny for the first time just two weeks before she died.“Mummy’s death came as such a shock to us all. We knew that heart disease ran in our family and my grandparents had had heart attacks at a young age but we didn’t expect this to happen,” she said. “Just two weeks before she died my wee nephew was born and she became a granny for the first time. She couldn’t wait for the baby to be born and had everything all in for him coming. She just doted on him but she only got two weeks with him before she died.”The charity night in St Malachy’s Old Boy’s Club will raise funds to power research into heart and circulatory diseases.“We don’t want another family to suffer like we have,” added Zara.“My wee brother found mummy in the house and between us we tried to resuscitate her but it was too late. We want to raise money to help fund research and stop this happening to other people. So many people loved and miss her. Her husband David, her children and her four brothers and all her friends. The night will be a lovely tribute to her.“Saturday will be a really good night and so many businesses and local people have been really generous with ballot prizes. It would be greatpeople could come along and enjoy a great night.”Órla Clarke, fundraising manager for BHF NI said: “Thanks to Zara and the Branf family for organising the charity night which will raise much needed funds for research. Our research has saved thousands of lives. Before the mid-s, nobody fully understood the cause of heart attacks and  per cent of people here who suffered a heart attack didn’t survive.“Our research has meant that today  per cent of people do survive a heart attack. But stories like Marie’s story show there is still so much to do.“ No family should lose their mummy at just .

After noticing smoke billowing from the property, the brave pair sprang into action, racing towards the fire to bring the people inside to safety.Recounting the dramatic ordeal, Antoin told us: “I couldn’t see the fire, so I thought it was the end house on my street. As soon as we got to the end of the street we could see the flames through the back windows – the whole lot was on fire.“Nobody lives in the house next door so I kicked in that door thinking somebody had broken in and set it on fire. Then I came round and hit the other door a boot and the fire nearly blew me off my feet.“I started smashing windows to let the smoke out. I smashed the front window and then climbed up and smashed one of the top windows and shouted at the top of my lungs, ‘Is anybody there ’“We found out there were people at the back of the house. We couldn’t get in the front because the flames were too big, so we went to the old couple next door, got them settled, and then my mate Terence started breaking down the fence with his shovel to get into the house. He got in the back way and lted the two people out of the house and out through the broken fence.“The smoke was all over the place so I thought all the houses were going to go up. I went to the houses on the other side and got them up. My neighbour had one of the kids and I had to bring the other one up the street to get them away from the smoke – I was trying to keep my hand over the child’s face to stop them breathing in the smoke. The black smoke was following us the whole way up.”Antoin added: “I think most people would have done it. I just did it because it was my own neighbours.

A clear message was sent to Brussels that the backstop is the problem,\" the DUP leader said.\"For weeks, Brussels called for a clear ask from the United Kingdom, they now have it.\"Whilst a consensus was reached, we must be realistic, the EU are tough negotiators. I don’t expect them to roll over within hours. But they must face up to reality. The blockage to getting a deal is the backstop, therefore there must be sensible engagement and a pragmatic approach.\"Speaking near the border the Fermanagh and South Tyrone MLA said that it was \"disgraceful for some in Brussels to exploit genuine fears by spinning tales of border posts, troops and queues\".\"No one is building border checkpoints. No one is sending troops to the border either. Such talk is foolish and careless,\" she said.\"Last week Michel Barnier acknowledged that there were mechanisms to avoid a so-called hard border, even in a no-deal scenario. Simon Coveney also helpfully acknowledged this in the Dail on Tuesday.\"I welcome the realism both in Brussels and Dublin. Such pragmatic statements ensure genuine fears of local people about the border are laid to rest.\"Mrs Foster said that the road forward would be \"long and winding\".\"Its now time for those who speak a lot about the Belfast Agreement to step up and demonstrate by their actions that the views of unionists are also valued,\" she said.\"A new border east-west is unacceptable to unionists. Let’s focus on getting a sensible deal which works for Brussels, Dublin and London.”"},{"url":null,"title":"co antrim mumofseven defends taking children on term time family holidays","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of protracted attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.While widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility and while there are some politicians who would like a swimming pool as part of any new development in the resort, this seems unlikely given there are local authority pools in Downpatrick, Kilkeel and Newry.It was previously suggested that the sale of the Annesley Buildings would free up the site for a new hotel and, signicantly, generate funds to help provide new leisure provision in the resort. But that now looks unlikely.As part of the drive to signicantly enhance leisure provision in the resort, council officials are continuing to work alongside education officials to develop a major new sports hub.Shimna Integrated College is planning to redevelop its King Street site which would include the creation of additional sports facilities at nearby Donard Park.It has been suggested that the proposed sports facilities could potentially be developed by the Department of Education in partnership with Newry, Mourne and Down Council with pitches and a sports pavilion forming the new sports hub which could also used by the community.While discussions are ongoing, the local authority still has to address the issue of no meaningful indoor sports facility in the resort to cater for both residents and visitors and is turning its attention to the Annesley Buildings site.Senior council officials have admitted that their initial thoughts about using the location for a town centre hotel have changed, confirming they are working to make a final decision on the way forward. It is also being suggested that the most likely outcome is developing a new leisure-cum-community facility at the Central Promenade site.A feasibility study on the redevelopment of the town centre site for a new hotel was completed several years ago which suggested a two or three-storey extension extension would be acceptable.The new hotel was viewed as a key ingredient in the plan to deliver highly ambitious proposals outlined in the Mournes Gateway proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle.Other proposals include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It has emerged that work on the high profile tourism project is progressing with moves to establish a board to deliver its ious elements, with membership including representatives from the local council, Tourism NI, Forest Service, Mourne Heritage Trust and National Trust.Over the next month, work is scheduled to start on tendering for consultancy and architectural services, alongside the recruitment of environmental and traffic management services.

Scrum half Conor Gibson was on hand to move the ball quickly to Hutley, who put Luka Walsh in space for the first score of the game.Omagh bounced back well, again using the wind effectively, and their pressure gave way to a penalty which they successfully struck to close the gap.As they continued to apply pressure, the home side had a chance to take the lead on the  minute mark, but their kick drted to the right hand side of the posts.With  minutes left in the half, Down High extended their lead. Having forced Omagh deep into their own half, Luka Walsh capitalised on Omaghrsquos decision to play out from their own quarters when he intercepted the ball to score his second of the day. Hutley slotted over the conversion. Down carried a - lead into half-time.With the strong wind now on their tails and a reasonable points buffer, Down High controlled the game well. Omagh continued to apply plenty of pressure, but the Down defence was hungry and with the exception of a few indiscretions they soaked up the Omagh onslaughts.With  minutes left the game took a critical turn when Hutley slotted agoal to take the Down lead to -.As would be expected from the men from the west, they didnrsquot lie down, but they were forced to chase the game.

However, the book kept me from thinking dark thoughts. Soon, all I wanted was to hold a copy of the book in my hand.Maureenrsquos dream came true in the autumn of  when her haunting story was finally published.Maureen, who is the mother of five grown-up children, explained some of the background as to why she put pen to paper.She added: ldquoI was initially setting out to piece together my family tree and the computer screen flashed up information on my great aunt Brigid. I was so fascinated with what I read that I could see the story unfold in a book and in turn I felt the plot would work well on screen too.Research took Maureen to the Presentation Convent in Co Kildare, which Brigid entered at the age of .Maureen said: ldquoI met with such a warm and friendly welcome from the community of sisters, that it gave me the desire to pursue Brigidrsquos story further. I travelled to Australia shortly after and I received the same, warm and friendly welcome from the sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Wagga Wagga.On herMaureen set about sting through a mountain of information and carefully crafted the remarkable story of her great aunt. The book was published in July  and was officially launched a few months later to a rapturous reception in Murphyrsquos Bar in Downpatrick.A chance meeting which her web designer, Michael McLaughlin, had had a year later led to a further development.She said: ldquoMichael was working on a display in Eclipse Cinema in Downpatrick for another movie when he struck up a random conversation with Colin McIvor.ldquoAs they chatted Michael mentioned that he had recently read a book written by a Downpatrick woman which he thought might make a great movie.ldquoWithin days Colin, with the backing of Northern Ireland Screen, was in my house and we were signing contracts on a movie deal. That was in July last year and since then the whole thing has snowballed.ldquoIt has been a pleasure putting the whole thing together. I wrote it like a novel which makes it easy for the reader to follow the story. My story is entirely based on fact.As Maureen describes the plot her face lights up. She believes her great aunt would be delighted at her revealing the long-lost tale to a new generation.ldquoBrigid had trained as a teacher and in  there was a great demand for priests and nuns with skilled trades in Australia and so she was shipped off to the mother house in Wagga Wagga.ldquoBrigid proved herself capable and popular with the children she taught for six years. But a bad day in front of a teaching inspector led the convent demoting her to refectory duties.ldquoTwo weeks turned into two years of hard labour that took their toll physically and mentally on poor Brigid. Requests toto her former duties were denied and feeling she had no real means of complaint, it left Brigid desperate.ldquoOne day she wandered outside the convent walls. Tears welled up in her eyes as she called at a strangerrsquos home. Her afternoon of tea and warm company by the fire ended all too soon and Brigid was sent back to the convent, seen by a doctor and put to bed, Maureen added.The story really begins in earnest at this crossroads in Brigidrsquos le. Drawing on every ounce of courage she had, Brigid leapt from her bed that night and made a hasty escape barefoot in her nightgown on a foggy winterrsquos night in .This night set the scene for a religious storm unprecedented in Australiarsquos history. Brigid found refuge in the home of Protestants who refuse to disclose her whereabouts to the Catholic authorities.A bishop swore before a magistrate that Brigid was insane and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was hunted down like an outlaw and the local media attention created a level of sectarian tension rarely unseen in that part of the world.Later, when there was no apology from the bishop for the arrest and slur on her character, Brigid turned to the courts for redress. But taking on the bishop meant taking on the Catholic Church.Maureen had a challenging time presenting Brigidrsquos story.She said: ldquoIt was a scandal at the time but I had to be careful to write it from both sides and let people judge for themselves. Itrsquos all I can do.Maureen says she is looking forward to the filmrsquos premiere.She added: ldquoIt will be the culmination of not just my five years of writing and telling the story, but all the hard work and effort that my family have put into supporting and helping me and, of course, the efforts of the film company, the director and the actors.Colin spoke of his enthusiasm over Maureenrsquos forthcoming film.ldquoI am thoroughly delighted to have optioned such an amazingly powerful book and to have met the inspirational Maureen and her family through the process, he said.He is currently adapting the book into a screenplay. ldquoI believe the film will offer a fantastic role for a strong female lead and supporting cast, he said. ldquoTo be able to bring this beautully written, dramatic and deserved piece to the silver screen some day would be just fantastic.Log on to Maureenrsquos website toon the forthcoming movie premiere at www.theextraordinarycaseofsisterliguori..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 30%2C 1979  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash A Strangford man had a narrow escape from death when he turned up for work on Monday morning at the new Abbey Lodge Hotel, outside Downpatrick.A muffled explosion during the night had ripped apart a section of the hotel mdash which was due to open in three weeksrsquo time mdash but no alarm was raised and workmen were unaware of the danger when they reported for work.One of the men, Mr Francis Black, from Strangford, passed through the lounge and noticed a black bag and two yellow tins. He thought it was some material left for him to carry on with a job and picked it up.Mr Black failed to notice several wires leading from the bag, but an examination of the contents told him something was wrong. He put it down and it was discovered later that the contents were competence for a lethal fire-type bomb.By then Mr Blackrsquos colleagues had discovered the damage caused by another bomb and a warning was raised. Police and firemen rushed to the scene and the main Downpatrick-Crossgar Road, beside the hotel, was sealed off as army bomb disposal experts raced from Lisburn.An army officer successfully defused the second bomb and workmen moved in to assess the damage, which was confined that bedroom section of the hotel.The hotel owner, Mr William Polly, said: ldquoDoors, windows, the gable and the roof have all been damaged and this includes a total of eight bedrooms. It will mean that an entire section of the building containing the bedrooms will have to come out. It was fortunate that the bomb in the lounge did not explode.A police spokesman confirmed that no warnings of the bombs were made. He said that the entire building would likely have been destroyedthe second bomb had gone off.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Two Down councillors have expressed annoyance over the Department of Educationrsquos rejection of proposals for a swimming pool in Ballynahinch.At this weekrsquos meeting of the South Eastern Education and Library Board Mrs Ethel Smyth and Mr Jarlath Carey said nothing less than a meeting with the minister, Lord Melchett, would achieve any satisfaction.Mrs Smyth said that the Departmentrsquos withdrawal of permission for the pool was an immense setback at a time when everyone assumed that the way ahead was clear for the construction of a multi-purpose community complex to be provided by Down Council and a learner pool to be provided by the board.Mr Carey said there was immense concern over the disappearance of what would have been a very happy exercise in joint provision. He was most annoyed that the decision had been made by the Department without consulting either the council or the board.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh and Shrigley Town Committee was given a massive confidence boost at its annual general meeting last Wednesday evening.An enthusiastic and lively audience of more than  people turned up in response to a publicity drive aimed at finding out what grassroots support the committee had in the area.The response promoted outgoing committee chairman Col Denys Rowan-Hamilton to say later: ldquoSuch a well-attended meeting makes it all worthwhile.In his opening address to the meeting Col Rowan-Hamilton traced the work of the committee in the last  months.He outlined the reasons why the decision was taken to close the community hall, which had been opened by the committee with tremendous enthusiasm by the committee only four years ago.He also reported on Killyleaghrsquos water supply problems and said the shortages of the last three years had caused more worry to some townspeople than any other single item.A new -strong committee was elected and they will meet soon to elect their own office-bearers.CROSSGAR mdash An upstairs bedroom in a Crossgar house was completely gutted when a fire broke out on Friday morning. Severe fire, heat, smoke and water damage was caused to the house at Lislea Drive.Firemen from Downpatrick and Ballynahinch were sent to the scene, but encountered dficulty finding water hydrants due to the snow-covered roads and footpaths. However, they pumped water from the nearby river.Weather conditions also affected the siren at Downpatrick.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The backstop is part of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for re-negotiation.\"And French President Emmanuel Macron also said the agreement was \"not re-negotiable\", in comments just moments before MPs voted.The Commons approved a cross-party amendment, tabled by Midlands MPs Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, rejecting a no-deal Brexit by  to .The vote is not legally binding on the government but will impose massive political pressure on the prime minister to delay Brexit from its scheduled date of March she cannot secure a new deal from Brussels.The PM told MPs: \"I agree that we should not leave without a deal.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed.

The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance.
