The preliminary data in the manuscript has not yet been peer reviewed.Blood from five out of six people who had been vaccinated as well as previously infected with Covid-19 still neutralised the Omicron variant, the manuscript said.“These results are better than I expected. The more antibodies you got, the more chance you’ll be protected from Omicron,” Mr Sigal said on Twitter.He said the lab had not tested the variant against blood from people who had received a booster dose, because they are not available in South Africa yet.According to the manuscript, the lab observed a 41-fold decline in levels of neutralising antibodies against the Omicron variant.Mr Sigal said on Twitter that figure is likely to be adjusted after his lab does more experiments.‘Substantial protection’While neutralising antibodies are an indicator of the body’s immune response, scientists believe other kinds of cells such as B-cells and T-cells also are stimulated by the vaccines and help protect against the effects of the coronavirus.The preliminary data does not indicate that the vaccine is less able to prevent severe illness or death. While lab tests are under way, BioNTech chief executive Ugur Sahin said last week: “We think it’s likely that people will have substantial protection against severe disease caused by Omicron.”The Omicron variant, first detected in southern Africa last month, has triggered alarms globally of another surge in infections, with more than two dozen countries from Japan to the United States reporting cases.The World Health Organisation classified it on November 26th as a “variant of concern”, but said there was no evidence to support the need for new vaccines specifically designed to tackle the Omicron variant with its many mutations.There is not significant data yet on how vaccines from Moderna, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and other drug-makers hold up against the new variant. All the manufacturers, including Pfizer and BioNTech, are expected to release their own data within weeks. Mr Sahin told NBC News on Tuesday that BioNTech has data coming on Wednesday or Thursday related to the new variant.Less severeTop US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said on Tuesday that preliminary evidence indicates that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus likely has a higher degree of transmissibility but is less severe.He said the US was doing its own tests to determine the protectiveness of the current vaccines against the variant and expects results sometime next week.Umer Raffat, an analyst for Evercore ISI, cautioned against reading too much into a single study, noting there has been significant variability in measuring declines in antibody levels in previous lab studies.“Let’s wait for additional studies to draw a mosaic,” he said. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"omicron ordeal exasperated by irish system meant to keep variant at bay","story":"Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport. Photograph: Brian LawlessPAMy first trip back to Ireland in 2½ years started to turn sour as soon as I walked through the immigration checkpoint at Dublin Airport on the morning of Friday, November 26th.Travelling overnight from Cape Town, where I live, I was aware that a new Covid-19 variant had been discovered in South Africa, but prior to my departure there was little public concern in my adopted home or the northern hemisphere about it.All that changed in the 18 hours and two flights it took me to get to Dublin. During that time EU member states agreed to tighten restrictions on all travel into the region from seven southern African countries, including South Africa.And by the time my second Lufthansa flight touched down at about 10.50am, the Irish Government was on the verge of implementing these restrictions to try and control the spread of Omicron.As I passed through customs and immigration control, I presented my travel documents, including the passenger locater form that people must fill out prior to entering the country. The official at the counter welcomed me home before adding that I had made it “by the skin of my teeth”.Despite arriving a few hours before the Government’s fresh restrictions came into force, I read in The  later that day about what the fresh restrictions would entail and decided to comply with them anyway.The report stated that foreign travellers from southern Africa would have to self-isolate for 10 days and undergo two mandatory PCR tests during their period of quarantine. In addition, the tests needed to produce negative results before the isolation period could end.A good friend and his partner had agreed to put a roof over my head for the first night I was back, but now they too had to quarantine for the same period that I did.Negative resultAlthough I had yet to receive any official communication from the Government regarding the new restrictions, I booked a PCR test with Randox Health in Leopardstown on Saturday, November 27th, and got a negative result the following morning.It was not until Sunday afternoon that I received my one and only official text message. It stated that, according to their records, I had travelled from a country at high risk of a Covid-19 variant of concern, so I must self-isolate for 10 days from the time I arrived in Ireland.It also said I must “attend for a PCR test asap and day eight after arrival in Ireland”. The message added: “You will receive a text message with the date and time of your PCR test(s).”Given that I had already been in Ireland for more than 48 hours before receiving this text, I felt relieved to have already taken a PCR test.Nevertheless, I resolved to take the two additional tests that were outlined in the message and waited for someone to contact me with the date, time and place that they would occur.However, much to my surprise I got a phone call on Tuesday, November 30th, from someone at a Covid-19 test centre asking why I had not turned up for my PCR test the day before. When I told the caller that I had not been contacted since Sunday, I was told this was not possible.I insisted it was the case but told the caller I had fortunately already taken a PCR test over the weekend and offered to send them the result as proof. This was not necessary, the caller said, who added I would be taken off their list.I stated I wanted to do the second PCR test that was scheduled for me on day eight of my self-isolation period, as I needed a negative result to re-enter South Africa. However, I was told their PCR tests were not valid for international travel.Second testThis scenario was repeated on day nine of my quarantine, when I got another call from a woman at a test centre who asked why I had not turned up for my second PCR test the day before.I explained what had happened earlier in the week and told her that I had already done a second PCR test that had produced another negative result.At this point I felt completely exasperated with the situation playing out before me. The whole reason for the forced self-isolation and mandatory PCR testing was to ensure travellers from southern Africa did not bring Omicron into Ireland.But in my case the system deployed by the Government to ensure this outcome had some serious glitches undermining it.Why was I only officially contacted about self-isolating more than 48 hours after entering the country? In addition, what sort of technical issues are undermining the HSE’s ability to contact people with the crucial information they need to comply with the PCR testing?Indeed, if my experience is not an isolated one, you would have to say these new restrictions have little chance of keeping Omicron at bay.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"why are there so many no shows for covid 19 booster vaccines","story":"Even though boosters have been available to some groups for several weeks, significant numbers of certain age cohorts still have not got their boosters. File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe The millionth Covid-19 booster or third vaccine jab was injected into an Irish arm this week, but the spotlight has been on no-shows for such appointments rather than the progress made.When Taoiseach Micheál Martin told the Dáil on Tuesday that only 93,000 people had shown up last week for 180,000 appointments for boosters and suggested there was not the “same urgency” for boosters as for the first doses of the Covid-19 vaccines, this resulted in a political pile-on on Martin. He was accused of unfairly blaming the public for the no-shows. Compounding the problem is the fact that there are many angry people out there in eligible groups who have been waiting anxiously for their boosters.The problem with the booster figures, like with so many things related to Covid-19 and the State’s response, is complicated. At the centre of it are technical issues in relation to the vaccination programme, where qualifying people can get booster doses through vaccination centres, GPs or pharmacies. Communications messNew HSE figures show that last week 93,000 boosters were administered through vaccination centres or other HSE channels, 70,000 through GPs and 25,000 at pharmacies. Problems emerge with how these three channels are tracked: the three different systems do not fully talk to each other.The HSE cannot see who cancels appointments at GPs and pharmacies. It also does not immediately know who receives boosters from GPs and pharmacies as it can take several days for booster vaccination records to land from GP surgeries and pharmacies.As a result, these people can subsequently get a text from the HSE calling them to another appointment or encouraging them to attend a GP or pharmacy for the booster. There have been numerous reports of people struggling to cancel appointments they are repeatedly called to.HSE chief operations officer Anne O’Connor has acknowledged the problem with “joining the dots” between the three different channels. All this has created a communications mess at a time when scientific evidence is pointing to the importance of getting booster doses to protect against the new Omicron variant.Another problem for the HSE is that some people have contracted Covid-19 since their second vaccine doses and so cannot get their booster dose for six months.Given that more than 300,000 people have been infected here since June, there is an unknown but possibly considerable number who cannot receive a booster yet, regardless of the number of times they are called for an appointment.The HSE has privately acknowledged this problem too and will be introducing a system where affected people can text back the word “Covid” to messages calling them to booster appointments. They would then not be offered an appointment for another six weeks, giving the HSE time to allow the two systems covering the vaccinated and infected lists to “talk to each other”. ReschedulingEven accounting for the technical problems and the eligibility criteria in relation to the required five-month gap since second doses and post-infection timing, the HSE has said that, for some people, there does not appear to be the same rush to get boosters as there was for primary doses.Those involved in the vaccination programme say some people are cancelling or even looking to reschedule booster appointments multiple times because the time given does not suit them.Take-up figures bear this out. Even though boosters have been available to some groups for several weeks, significant numbers of certain age cohorts still have not got their boosters.As of recent days, the numbers yet to received booster doses include 15 per cent of those aged 80 and over, 22 per cent of people in their 70s, and 28 per cent of healthcare workers. Fixing the system will be essential before the vaccination programme becomes even more complicated with the rollout of boosters to the 620,000 people in their 50s from today and first vaccine doses to 480,000 five- to 11-year-olds in the coming weeks.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"donegal town dealing with mica if it was in dublin this would already be fixed","story":"Moville, on Donegal’s Inishowen peninsula, is among the worst affected areas in the country for mica and for the students in Moville Community College, the subject is rarely far from their minds.  Video: Enda O\u0027DowdAngeline Ruddy, deputy principal of Moville Community College: ‘It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips... There’s no getting away from mica’. Photograph: Enda O’DowdAt Moville Community College, everybody is talking about mica.“There’s not an English essay that’s passed to a teacher that doesn’t have a mention of mica in it somewhere... and every time you mention humanitarian issues it’s the first thing to the forefront,” says deputy principal Angeline Ruddy.“It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips,” she says. “There’s no escaping it. There’s no getting away from mica.”The presence of the mineral in construction blocks – which makes them crack and eventually crumble – has caused structural damage to an estimated 7,500 homes in counties Donegal and Mayo, as well as smaller numbers in other counties.Mica has impacted the entire community, says principal Anthony Doogan, and the school community is no different.At Moville Community College approximately 20 per cent of staff and 25 per cent of pupils – about 20 staff and 100 families – are living in “mica homes” even more have siblings and parents who are affected.“I have five siblings, and four of them are affected by mica,” says Ruddy. The one who isn’t lives in the US.“Where I live, in a half mile radius, 20 houses are affected. It’s everywhere we go.”Her children “know nothing else but a mica household” as they go about their daily routine, mica is “like an app running in the background for every one of us.“‘Is the house safe tonight?’ is a regular question my children will ask,” she says. “I have cracks that are now the width of a two-euro coin, which means my gable is starting to move away from the wall of my house. I don’t know, really, if we are safe any longer.”Others tell a similar story. Special needs assistant Barry Moore’s home is crumbling his daughter was riding her bike around the house when “a lump of plaster fell off... it was near enough to scare her, and me.”“You’re lying at home at night and you hear the walls moving. It’s scary, to think you’re living in a place that is meant to be your safe place and you’re hearing the walls cracking.”Five of the special needs assistants – nearly half of the special needs staff – have mica homes, and so do some of the students they support. A hoist used by one child is attached to a crumbling mica wall, while foster parents have bought two mobile homes to house their children with complex needs.“They need routine, they need to know what happening... they’re going to be moved into two mobile homes behind their house and watch their house getting knocked down,” says Moore.In school, he says, you can “see the children who have mica, or whose houses have mica. They are, like their parents probably are, nearly obsessed with the fact they have mica.“As staff you’re trying to accommodate and support children... but they’re going home to houses that aren’t safe and that are causing them grief and stress.”Guidance counsellor Sineád McCarron’s home also has mica she warns of “what’s coming down the line... this is just going to explode, really, in terms of the amount of support the students need.”As principal, Doogan has significant concerns about the physical and mental health of students and staff – not least through heightened levels of anxiety – and about the impact on students’ attendance and life chances the effects, he estimates, will persist for the next five to 10 years.The anxiety of students and parents “is having an impact on their work rate and their effectiveness at their studies at school,” he says.“Every secondary school in the country”, he emphasises, has seen the effects of Covid “We’re at the beginning of this cycle for mica and in two years’ time, when there’s a large number of houses in this community which need to be demolished and rebuilt, there will be severe anxiety and perhaps worse felt by a lot of our students.”There is also “clear evidence” of an increase in absenteeism due to illness – “they’re living in draughty rooms, the rooms are colder, the rooms are causing them health issues that they wouldn’t ordinarily have” as well as students from mica homes who have left school altogether.Brother and sister Shaun and Aoife Noone describe how their home is “falling down”: “If I put my hand in the wall I could just pull away some of the side of the house,” says 17-year-old Shaun.They have moved out so that their home can be demolished and rebuilt. “I don’t really have a study room so that’s affecting my study, because I’m doing my Leaving Cert now, and it’s harder to focus and settle down and get work done,” he says.“I feel disadvantaged, it’s unfair that most people would stress or be anxious about exams but I’ve got the pressure of my house on top of that, so it’s a bit hard on the mind as well.”Aaron Price (13) and his family have also moved out. “It was a lot to handle trying to go to school and do homework and trying to empty the house.”The Government this week announced a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild mica homes in Donegal and Mayo, capped at €420,000 per home and with a sliding scale of rebuilding costs from €145 per sq ft for the first 1,000 sq ft to €110 for the next 1,000 and €100 thereafter.It has been criticised by the mica campaigners in Donegal as falling short. “Apparently a new scheme was decided but it’s stupid, apparently each square metre gets less money, that doesn’t make sense,” says Aaron.“We need 100 per cent, and I know we probably will never get that, but if it was in Dublin, this would already be fixed.“It’s not our fault, we spent a lot of money on building our house... why should we have to spend more and more money rebuilding our house?”The adults have done the figures each of those spoken to by The  is facing a shortfall of between €60,000 to €80,000. “If council houses are being built at the minute they are built on a rate of €150 a square metre,” says Moore. “What was being offered would work out essentially for our house at €127 a square metre, which would leave us paying €65,000 on top of what we would get.“My other half is a psychiatric nurse, we’re no millionaires, we’re working-class people and we live in an average size house in Donegal which is the average in the country for a one-off build, 2,500 sq ft.“If they had dropped the sliding scale part... 145 euro per square foot, that’s it, and then your rent and then your storage, I would say 90 per cent of people would have been happy and celebrating, but they put in a scale that doesn’t exist in any builder’s pricing.”“The cost to me right now is €79,000, and that’s just for the build,” says Ruddy. “My house is 2,600 sq ft... that gives a total of €315,000 of a grant. The builders have come back to me with €395,000.“I can’t borrow because I have a mica home... 100 per cent redress is so far from it, I don’t think I’m even getting 80 per cent redress.“My children are at the stage where I should be starting to save for their college. Am I going to build their house and deprive them of education? We’re facing these choices.”“People bought the material in good faith... yet they are being victimised to the extent of having to spend 40, 50, 60, €80,000, whereas other areas were given 100 per cent redress,” says Doogan.For him, it is about the value placed on people from this area, not least given that the school itself is still “nowhere near completion” 20 years after it opened. “We bailed out the banks for €64 billion, and they’re saying three or four billion is a huge amount of money, but it’s less than five per cent of what we gave to the banks.“The people up here paid their taxes to pay for the bank bailout, and people here, like me, paid their taxes to pay for the pyrite redress in Dublin and Leinster. People round here are saying, ‘is there a different law for us?’”McCarron, too, is clear: “How can we help people look after their wellbeing and instil value systems of fair justice when our own Government continues to let this happen?”“They’ve let us down,” says 15-year-old Aoife. “If this was happening in Dublin, I feel it would be a different story, because we’re that far away and we’re rural they say ‘ah, them Donegal ones, they live in big mansions, they can afford it’. We can’t.

Much like the last-minute mask decision fiasco the Government takes no consideration of parents ability to choose what might be best for their children or give parents time to deal with the fallout from the decisions. I would hope that in future they could consider parents in their late-night decision making.‘Does the Department of Education have any cop-on at all?’Kieran O’Hare DublinA ham-fisted, behind-covering, one-size-fits-all decision that has greatly inconvenienced parents and deprived children of yet another day’s valuable learning. It was nothing more than a very windy day in south central Dublin on Tuesday. It was even less inclement on Wednesday. Does the Department of Education have any cop-on at all? Why not delegate the decision to school principals. They are on the ground and best placed to make a call on local conditions. What will prompt the next enforced closure? The wrong type of wind?‘This is just not acceptable’Shirley Dunne GalwayIn Galway city, Tuesday was a bit breezy Wednesday was calm and the sun was shining. There is absolutely no reason why schools in Galway city should have closed. We will have a long winter, and negative implications on our children’s education, if schools close every time there is an orange weather alert. We are both trying to work from home whilst our children are home from school, and the school did not roll out any online learning or send home any materials for the children to work on. This is just not acceptable, or sustainable long-term.I am a third-year student in NUI Galway doing exams. They were planned to be on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday but due to the college closure the Tuesday and Wednesday exams were postponed to Saturday and Sunday. This creates a very stressful period as they have been placed in the middle of other exams. I now have four exams in a row from Friday to Monday, also with exams on the following Wednesday and Thursday. Six exams in seven days is not ideal. Both Tuesday and Wednesday did not display any strong winds that would prevent such exams taking place. This is not the type of pressure my course colleagues and I want in the run up to Christmas.‘I’ve no back-up. The pandemic has taken away all my unpaid supports’S Riordan CorkI’m a separated mother of two small children working a four-day week. Working from home (WFH) has its benefits and generally I work a hybrid model mostly. However, when the preschools \u0026amp schools are closed and I’ve no back-up, I’m actually parenting from work at my kitchen table rather than working from home. And I have no back-up. The pandemic has taken away all my unpaid supports – mainly my elderly parents – and the housing crisis, resulting in ever increasing rents, keeps pushing me further and further away from the city where my friends and family live. I do not live long enough in one place to make lasting friendships with neighbours that I could approach for help. My childminder is wonderful, but I pay her €70full day when I earn €95 net. I borrow to work the school summer holidays, I cannot afford any unplanned or unexpected curveballs like these last two days of red weather alerts and school closures. And with end-of-year deadlines, calling in sick is not an option. My workload would only be waiting for my return. Furthermore, I worry about the lasting developmental damage this frequent ‘WFH’ is forcing upon my young children. Both have been sick a lot lately and I cannot send them to school with even a snivel anymore. When they are sick I can no longer take time off to mind them because I am now able to ‘WFH’. So the frequency of this scenario of me at the kitchen table on the laptop ignoring them has increased.When there are two parents, they can help one another, give each other a break. I on the other hand, cannot even go to the shop for milk without packing us all out the door! Lets not forget that we’ve had long runs of school closures in the very recent past in this pandemic. And, in isolation these two days of red weather alerts and school closures would be manageable. However, within the context of this pandemic, a housing crisis and only the beginning of a long winter, it feels like the last straw.‘At 11pm we got the email the creche would close’Mrunal Kotkunde Dublin 16I was okay and scheduled all meetings to next day as I have toddler at home and it was difficult to work with him around. On Tuesday, weather was not bad in Dublin 16 and I thought the decision to close schools and crèches were uncalled for. They should have access the severity and took the decision only on affected areas and not generalised the decision. We got an email from the creche that on Wednesday it would be be open but at 11pm at night got the email that it was closed due to Government decision. Weather was not bad at all, as I have seen much worse weather than these two days. Has the crèche refunded us two days’ fees?We have already had enough stress due to Covid-19.‘Probably the right decision at the time’Kevin Connolly CorkIn our area of east Cork, the storm, thankfully, didn’t hit us as hard as other parts of the county or other counties. The decision to close the schools for the second day proved to be unnecessary in our part of the county, but it was probably the right decision at the time, and was no doubt influenced by poorer conditions in the west of the county. The decision was made in good time, 5.30pm and it was flagged for a few hours before the official decision was made.There was strong wind here for a couple of days. Nothing to worry about, yet two children home from school. Complete nonsense. Children packed into Mcdonald’s yesterday, and packed into indoor play centre today. It was NOT dangerous to go out. Stupid decision.I’m astounded at why the schools were closed when they have had ample opportunity over the past two years to operate online. It reinforces that those accountable for education in our country are not of a proactive or progressive mindset and take the easy option. Very disappointing.‘Conditions were not dangerous’Dermot Maguire DublinI am at a loss to understand why the schools in Dublin were closed. Conditions were not dangerous, it was indeed cold, wet and miserable, but it was also the same in December when I went to school 35 years ago. However, we just went to school and got on with it. Children have missed more school over the past two years due to the pandemic, on top of already the ridiculous amount of holidays for teachers, course days, etc. Of course, the decision to close schools was the one decision over the past number of years that the teacher unions accepted without question. I fear for the education of our children and their mental health.I had not been advised by the preschool so on Tuesday I turned up to it and realised it was closed. I had hectic days trying to do basic things as I live alone with a toddler. The school closures have disrupted my days but finally it’s over.‘These decisions should be taken lightly’John Lalor DublinThe weather didn’t seem severe enough to justify the closure, in Dublin at least. Children have missed some much school time with Covid closures that these decisions should not be taken lightly. Additionally, most working parents had to take two days’ annual leave or lose two days’ pay to mind their kids at short notice. Obviously this isn’t the case in the Department of Education but decision-makers should be mindful of the impact on private sector workers.‘I don’t get this need to blame schools for the weather’Anne Cassidy DublinI would not have sent my kids on Wednesday even if the Government had not closed schools. The weather warning finished at 7am. We leave the house at that time so I had already decided to do the safest thing for my children and work from home. I don’t get this need to blame schools for the weather or the Government and I’m happy to blame the Government for a lot. I’m not sure sure I’d want to be a principal having to deal with that last night, but as a parent kids’ safety overrides my inconvenience. Even if in your particular area it seemed fine we all travel to work think how much more dangerous it would have been with school traffic and fallen branches.‘Is this to be the new norm?’Paul Richardson BrayIreland is an island. Consequently, the weather is regularly wet and windy. In Bray today it is merely breezy and a status yellow warning has been applied. But somehow the local environs are deemed unsafe for school commutes. If navigating your way past fallen leaves and the occasional puddle is challenging, then the decision to close schools for a second day was indeed a wise one. If on the other hand, you consider the inclement weather to be a regular feature of life in this country, then the school closures are perplexing to say the least. Is this to be the new norm – school closures on the basis of oft-cited, but rarely challenged, health and safety concerns?‘We don’t have a family to help in Ireland’Jonas Rall DublinIn Dún Laoghaire, Dublin, the storm was mild, with only leaves and bins being affected. My son, that is two years old, goes to a creche that closed Tuesday and Wednesday, with such short notice that I couldn’t make any arrangements. We don’t have a family to help in Ireland. This put massive stress over my partner and me to take the day off on Tuesday, move meetings and customers to the following days, only to be warned at 11pm on Tuesday that Wednesday would also have the creche closed.

Photograph: iStock And then there was the day Micheál Martin compared Sinn Féin to the long dead British comedian, Tommy Cooper. But the Taoiseach, out of the blue, treated the Dáil to a blast of good old Tommy’s famous catchphrase: “Just like that!” Not once, but three times. Unfortunately, he couldn’t do justice to the celebrated entertainer – Micheál’s delivery went down like a lead balloon while his allusion soared over most of the Shinner heads across the floor. It is well known that Micheál fancies himself as a bit of a mimic. His attempt at a Chinese accent during a tech industry event a decade ago was so well received he had to issue an apology afterwards. But on Wednesday, he chickened out of doing a proper impression of the butter-fingered magician and comedy master. Where was the bumbling, mumbling voice? He barely attempted the famous hand actions. This came as a crushing disappointment to Micheál’s older listeners, the only ones who knew who he was banging on about. Obviously, it would have been too much to expect the Taoiseach to conduct Leaders’ Questions wearing Cooper’s trademark red fez on his head, but by summoning the spirit of the great entertainer he created a mental image some of us can never erase.Tommy died 37 years ago during a live television performance. Were he alive today he would be 100 years old. The youthful political correspondents were stumped. By the look of the slack-jawed Shinners staring back blankly at the Taoiseach, they hadn’t a clue what he was on about either. Blind-sided by the zeitgeist.Housing niggle-festThe comedian, hugely popular in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, bizarrely made his posthumous debut on the Dáil record during a routine housing niggle-fest between Micheál and Sinn Féin president, Mary Lou McDonald. Yet again, she lambasted his “failing” Coalition’s “failing” housing policy which is heading towards “serious catastrophe”. For any government with “an ounce of cop-on, alarm bells would be ringing very loudly. Instead, we get deafening silence, heads stuck in the sand, no urgency to respond, no forward-thinking, and, frankly, no common sense.”Yet again, he lambasted Sinn Féin for voting against housing proposals at local level 5,000 of them in Dublin including 853 social, affordable and cost-rental homes at the Oscar Traynor Road site. “I see a lot of sloganeering, sound bites and nice catchy phrases, but I don’t see real substance from a policy perspective.”Whatever he proposes, it is never enough for Mary Lou and Sinn Féin. When his Government says it can realistically provide up to 12,000 affordable houses next year, 10,000 of which will be directly built through local authorities or approved housing bodies, Sinn Féin has a stock response.“You just come along and say ‘Aah, we think that should be 20,000’.”For some odd reason, Micheál resorted to the days of old-fashioned variety shows to explain his point. “Like Tommy Cooper long ago: ‘Just like that’. You know?”He threw out one hand, but it was nothing to match the shoulders hunched, arms half-extended, palms-down shuffle that Tommy used to do. But the show must go on. “Just like that! We’ll make it 20,000,” he exclaimed in a strange hybrid of Cooper meets Cork. Mary Lou didn’t even look at him.“If the Minister says 4,000 in respect of affordable housing – just like that! – we’ll make it 8,000, Sinn Féin will say.” The Taoiseach plucked something imaginary from the air, perhaps a hard-boiled egg from behind young Jack Chambers’s ear. As for the youthful chief whip, sitting behind his boss? Not a breeze.No, concluded Micheál of Sinn Féin’s “threadbare” housing policy. “No substance behind it. It’s just empty rhetoric, as far as I can see.”As usual, the exchanges descended into a shouting match. “Could we all make a Christmas resolution to behave with a bit of decorum, please?” pleaded the Ceann Comhairle, and him still recovering from the Covid. Leaders’ questions moved on. To the Covid, not surprisingly.Booster confusionCatherine Murphy of the Social Democrats brought up the confusion in the booster vaccination campaign. Many people were annoyed when the Taoiseach complained in the Dáil on Tuesday about people not turning up for their appointments. Catherine Murphy pointed out, not unreasonably, that they feel he was unfairly blaming them for the situation when the truth is that the booking system is all over the place. What had the Taoiseach to say about this?“Last night I slept like a log. I woke up in the fireplace.”“I sleep like a baby. Every morning I wake up screaming around 2 o’clock.”“I worry that as soon as I get into bed I drop off. I better order a bigger bed.” Sorry. That wasn’t Micheál’s reply. That’s a bit of Tommy Cooper. Blame the Taoiseach for sending us to look up some of his old gags. Where the Government’s handling of the pandemic response is concerned, the Opposition’s watchword has always mirrored another one of Tommy’s famous catchphrases. “Not like that, Taoiseach. Like that.”Mattie McGrath returned to active service after a few months’ absence with his views on the “draconian powers” adopted by Government during the pandemic unchanged. He still believes the requirement to produce digital passes to gain access to certain services and events is a form of “medical apartheid”. Independent Catherine Connolly was also concerned about the renewed temporary Covid laws infringing on civil liberties. The Taoiseach put up a strong, if weary, defence.Protecting livesA government needs to be “nimble” about introducing legislation to protect lives during a pandemic, he told Mattie. “It’s not the kind of legislation any government wants to bring in. Why would we want to bring in legislation that restricts normal life? There’s no joy in doing that.” As any politician knows “it’s not the most popular thing in the world to be restricting people’s personal liberties and freedom”. Likewise to Catherine Murphy: People are fed up with the pandemic. The restrictions are weighing heavy on people. Younger people are particularly fed up. “But those in the engine room have to keep going to help people. I say again, what is the most fundamental human right of all? It’s to protect life and limb.” Meanwhile, the hip young things of the Fianna Fáil Comms team were busy on social media with their leader’s finger-on-the pulse reference to the late Tommy Cooper. They quickly posted clips from his Dáil performance on Twitter and YouTube (labelled as a “Must Watch”). Micheál must be delighted. We hear he was boasting that not only is he up on the Tweet machine and the Tube, but that he is probably up on Snaptoc, facetic and the InstantGran too.Just like that."},{"url":null,"title":"developed nations have a moral duty to waive patents on vaccines","story":"The satirist James Gillray channelled  popular anxieties about vaccination  in his 1802 cartoon The Cow Pock–or–the Wonderful Effects of the New Inoculation! At the centre, Edward Jenner is seen delivering a  vicious gouge to a woman’s arm with his lancet as all around her the previous vaccine recipients undergo horrible transformations. As I write this month’s column, coronavirus cases are once again on the rise. The seven-day rolling average of infections has climbed above 5,000 in the State for the first time since January. The Omicron variant saw the European Union recommend the suspension of travel to and from several southern African countries where it has become prominent, despite being discovered independently in several European countries with no demonstrable link to southern Africa.This is a reminder of our privileged position in the global north, with a surplus of vaccines available. As we roll out the third wave of booster jabs, countries such as South Africa, which led calls for a patent waiver to speed up vaccine production, have been able to vaccinate only 28 per cent of their population. Elsewhere in the region, that percentage often drops to single figures.Of course, this winter coronavirus is not the only respiratory virus that we will be vaccinating against. This is traditionally flu season in the northern hemisphere.In the southern hemisphere, however, winter has just ended. One interesting finding from Australia is that vaccination, alongside social distancing and similar restrictions to combat coronavirus spread, has had a dramatic effect on flu cases.In July two people died of flu in Australia, the first in more than a year. The five-year average for Australian flu deaths is 404. There were just 21,266 flu cases confirmed by Australian laboratories this season, compared to an average of 113,861 in the previous five years.Airborne diseasePublic health measures have been so effective in restricting airborne disease transmission that there have been no confirmed cases of two of the four major strains of flu anywhere in the world for more than 18 months. There are two families of the flu virus, influenzas A and B. Influenza A is ided into subtypes based on their surface proteins (H1N1 and H3N2) which are then ided into clades. Influenza B is ided into two lineages, Victoria and Yamagata. An entire clade of H3N2 (3c3.A) was last detected in March 2020, while no cases of BYamagata have been confirmed since last April.It may be too soon to declare these strains extinct, but the reduction in their prevalence is certainly remarkable. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has only ever declared two diseases extinct: the cattle disease rinderpest, and one human disease, smallpox. Both were the result of massive vaccination drives and global campaigning.In 1796 Edward Jenner developed the first vaccine by taking material from cowpox lesions on a cow maid (vaccine comes from vaccus, the Latin for cow) and injecting it into an eight-year-old boy. Several weeks later, he injected the boy with live smallpox, with no ensuing infection.InoculationThis approach would not receive ethical approval today, but it did demonstrate that cowpox could protect against smallpox and offered an alternative to the more dangerous method of inoculation, originating in China, by exposure to a mild version of smallpox.By the late 19th century, vaccination meant Ireland was recording only a handful of smallpox deaths each year. In the early 1870s a smallpox pandemic killed about 4,000 people here. England, with about four times the population, recorded more than 40,000 smallpox deaths in the same period. Other countries with less stringent vaccination regimes were even more badly affected and saw double or treble those rates.Tropical countriesThe technical and sanitary challenges posed by using a culture drawn from animal samples and stored in glycerol meant that vaccination was particularly difficult in tropical countries.However, in the 1950s, Leslie Collier at the Lister Institute developed a freeze-dried vaccine. In the following decade, Benjamin Rubin of Wyeth Laboratories designed the bifurcated needle, which allowed for reliable and cheap vaccination using the Lister vaccine with minimal training.These developments, and the decision to waive patents and royalties on the needle and vaccine, enabled the WHO to launch its 1966-1977 campaign to eradicate smallpox globally.Coming shortly after a failed effort to eradicate malaria, the team led by Donald Henderson had to overcome scepticism that eradication was possible. But after 14 years of careful searching and contact tracing, millions of vaccines delivered using a “ring” approach to target resources effectively, and $300 million, smallpox was finally declared eradicated in 1980.The news that public health measures have a significant impact on respiratory virus spread is very welcome, but the lesson from history is that developed nations have a moral duty and practical rationale for waiving patents to vaccinate more quickly the global south. \u0026nbspEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"schools in denmark to close early for christmas as covid cases surge","story":"Denmark’s prime minister Mette Frederiksen: ‘The new variant entails a significant risk of critically overloading the health service, and that is why we now have to do more.’ Photograph: Adrian DennisPoolAFP via GettyDenmark’s government is shutting schools early for the Christmas break in an effort to counter a surge of Covid-19 cases in the country.Nightlife is also being restricted as a closing time of midnight for clubs, bars and restaurants has been set.The prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, also banned concerts where audiences have more than 50 people standing and required restaurant patrons to wear face masks when they are not seated.She further recommended that people work from home.The measures apply as of Friday and are set to last for four weeks. The virtual teaching starts on December 15th. In Denmark, schools go on Christmas break from December 20th.Speaking about the Omicron variant of coronavirus, Ms Frederiksen said that it is “expected that this will mean more infected, more sick and thus potentially more hospitalised patients”.“Thus, the new variant also entails a significant risk of critically overloading the health service, and that is why we now have to do more,” she said.Norway on Tuesday introduced a 10-person limit for gatherings at private homes, although the number will be increased to 20 on Christmas and New Year’s eves. It also is capping attendance at public events without assigned seating at 50.In addition, the government says it is advising people to work from home when possible and reintroducing a social distancing requirement for restaurants.Neighbouring Sweden also has recommended that employers give their workers the opportunity to work from home, and face masks are required on public transportation when crowding cannot be avoided. – Associated PressEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Minority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragedies"},{"url":null,"title":"watch kamala harris became incredible disappearing vice president","story":"Kamala Harris made history as the first woman, first Black American and first Asian-American to become vice president. But after less than a year in the post, she is a historically unpopular vice president, according to The \u0027s Washington Editor Rozina Sabur. As seen in the video above, where Ms Harris was once always in the frame during Joe Biden\u0027s major addresses, she\u0027s been notably absent from the president\u0027s side of late. “For now at least, it seems she is no longer Joe Biden\u0027s heir apparent,” says Rozina Sabur.“A number of Democrats seem prepared to challenge her for the nomination should Biden not seek re-election in 2024.”More from NewsCovid latest news: Sajid Javid says no to \u0026#39unethical\u0026#39 mandatory vaccinationsA baby daughter for Boris Johnson, as Carrie gives birth to their second child\u0026#39My fundamental freedoms are being ripped away\u0026#39: Readers on moving to Covid Plan BEU Commission plan allows police officers to cross borders, shoot and arrest suspectsPolitics latest news: Three Christmas parties to be investigated as pressure grows on Boris JohnsonNew Zealand bans young people from ever buying cigarettes shortly after making drug testing legalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"believe not female priests claim 20 festive ms jumper unofficial","story":"They may not be renowned for being trendsetters. Nor are their seasonal “must-haves” a popular choice on the runways of Paris, London and Milan.Yet female clergy are jumping on an unexpected sartorial trend, with hundreds across the world choosing to wear new Marks \u0026amp Spencer Christmas jumpers. So popular is the new style that a leading Church of England bishop has described it as “the new clergy uniform”.The black jumper, emblazoned with the word “Believe” in bold colours, has been bought by a string of female priests. Using the hashtag “TeamBelieve”, they have taken to social media to share selfies of themselves wearing the jumper.Rev Kate Bottley, a priest in Nottinghamshire and the former Gogglebox star, posted a picture, saying: “Never one to shy away from a bandwagon, like most of the clerics I know I’ve bought this jumper.”Ruth Bushyager, the Bishop of Horsham, tweeted a picture of female priests in the Chichester diocese wearing the £19.50 Christmas jumper, saying: “Vote of thanks to @marksandspencer for the new clergy uniform @ChichesterDio”Leigh Greenwood, a Baptist minister, added: “Do you think @marksandspencer have realised yet that they’ve become the unofficial suppliers of clergy Christmas jumpers?”Rev Claire Jones, a curate in Bodmin, Cornwall, is collating a photo montage of more than 200 clergy wearing their Believe jumpers, saying the jumper had “struck a chord among women clergy”.“We have 220 pictures so far,” she added. “All ordained women, from at least seven different denominations.

We might think believing at Christmas is just for children and Santa, but there’s an even more wonderful story at the heart of Christmas which is good news for everyone who believes it!”However, some clergy, for whom the XL size is not big enough, have declared their disappointment at not being able to join in on the trend.

The man died between AD 130 and AD 337, according to radiocarbon dating.It is the first example of a Roman crucifixion in the UK, and one of only a handful of similar cases worldwide.David Ingham, who led the excavation, told The : It\u0027s the best example of a crucified inidual from the Roman world. We\u0027d like to stage a reconstruction at some point to see what he looked like. We\u0027d use the skull and recreate the whole body.Corinne Duhig, an archaeologist at the University of Cambridge who examined the remains, concluded that crucifixion was the only likely explanation for the injuries.It is thought that the man\u0027s limbs had been tethered during his life, as his lower legs showed signs of thinning due to shackles.He was likely crucified on a roadside half a mile away from the small cemetery in Fenstanton where he was buried.Crucifixion was the main form of capital punishment in Roman times. Constantine the Great banned the practice during his reign in AD 306-337.Romans reserved crucifixion for condemned slaves, rebels and lower classes. It was designed to prolong an agonising death, and to serve as a warning to others.Suffocation was the usual cause of death, as the unnatural position of the arms being pinned above the head meant the condemned person couldn\u0027t take enough air into the lungs.Despite the link between crucifixion and Christianity, experts believe there was no religious element in this case.It is highly unusual for a victim of crucifixion to be buried, as they are usually left in the open area or thrown into a pit.It is also very rare to recover the nails used to pin the person to the wooden frame, as they were often recovered following death due to their value in Roman times as a metal. Most crucifixions were also carried out using rope.Biblical texts refer to crucifixion taking place with wooden crosses, but using a wooden board instead is thought to be a local variation in this case.No other nails were found in the man\u0027s body, suggesting that he was tied to the wooden frame with rope and the heel bone nail was to prevent him from moving.There was a 1cm-deep hole near where the nail was embedded in his heel, suggesting more than one attempt to pin his body to the wood.Archaeologists believe he would have hung for more than a day slowly dying.The first skeletal evidence for crucifixion was found in 1968 during an excavation of a cemetery in Giv\u0027at ha-Mivtar in Jerusalem. A heel bone with an embedded nail was discovered.However, the remains were less well preserved than the Fenstanton man, and had been moved from one burial site to another.Other skeletons with holes in their heels were discovered in Mendes in Egypt in the 1990s, and in Gavello, Italy, in 2006 - but it is not certain that the holes were caused by crucifixion.Fenstanton man was found in a cemetery with six other graves. His remains are one of 48 sets which were found by archaeologists in five Fenstanton cemeteries during digs between 2017 and 2018.More from NewsCovid latest news: Sajid Javid says no to \u0026#39unethical\u0026#39 mandatory vaccinationsA baby daughter for Boris Johnson, as Carrie gives birth to their second child\u0026#39My fundamental freedoms are being ripped away\u0026#39: Readers on moving to Covid Plan BEU Commission plan allows police officers to cross borders, shoot and arrest suspectsPolitics latest news: Three Christmas parties to be investigated as pressure grows on Boris JohnsonNew Zealand bans young people from ever buying cigarettes shortly after making drug testing legalMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"plan b covid restrictions mean schools","story":"School nativity plays should go ahead and pupils should not be taken out of classes, Boris Johnson has said, despite announcing a raft of new measures to counter the spread of the omicron Covid variant.Speaking at a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday, the Prime Minister said that the doubling time for the number of omicron cases could be between two and three days, and added that there was no indication yet that it is any less severe than previous strains. Mr Johnson announced that vaccine passports will now be mandatory for nightclubs and large events, and face masks will be required in most indoor public spaces from Friday, including theatres and cinemas. The Prime Minister also called on Britons to work from home where possible from Monday. However, he stressed that the new measures were not a lockdown and cautioned parents against taking their children out of school early. We do not want kids to be taken out of school before the end of term, not that there is a very long time to go now. We do not want nativity plays to be cancelled, he said. We think that it is OK currently, on what we can see, to keep going with Christmas parties. But everybody should exercise due caution have ventilation, wash your hands, get a test before you go, give everybody at the party confidence they are going to be meeting someone who is not contagious.No. The Prime Minister insisted that he does not want to see schools close early for Christmas, and called on parents not to take their children out of lessons as a precaution. No updated guidance has been issued by the Department for Education.However, the UK’s largest teacher union has called on the Government to implement a Plan B for schools, including the return on bubbles and face masks in the classroom.The National Education Union (NEU) also urged ministers to step up self-isolation rules for children, as well as reintroduce one-way systems and staggered break times to reduce transmission.Kevin Courtney, the NEU\u0027s joint general secretary, said: We are disappointed that in his announcement the Prime Minister has made no mention of schools, given that cases are rising so fast and this is leading to so much disruption of education.More than 200,000 pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons on November 25 and since then infection rates among school-age children have risen further. It is clear that current mitigations are not enough to keep at bay rising case counts, especially in the new context of the fast-spreading Omicron variant.The National Education Union put out its own Plan B for schools earlier today, and we think Boris Johnson must act now to minimise the disruption of education.The Government recommends that staff, adult visitors and pupils in Year 7 and above wear face masks when moving around educational premises and outside of classrooms, such as in corridors and communal areas. Pupils are also advised to wear face masks when travelling on public transport and dedicated school transport. However, the Government does not currently advise pupils and teachers to wear face masks inside the classroom.In primary schools, face masks are still recommended to be worn by staff and adults when moving around in corridors and communal areas, but not in classrooms. Children in primary schools are not advised to wear face coverings. The Government does not currently advise the re-implementation of bubbles in schools. This means that if a single pupil in a specific cohort tests positive for Covid, the entire class or year group does not need to be sent home to isolate. School assemblies, nativity plays, and break time mixing can still take place. However, the Government warns that schools should ensure that contingency plans cover the possibility that it may become necessary to reintroduce bubbles for a temporary period in order to reduce mixing between groups. And decision to recommend the reintroduction of bubbles would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education, it says. All iniduals who have been identified as a close contact of a suspected or confirmed case only of the omicron variant will be required to self-isolate immediately, regardless of vaccination status and age. Further actions may also be taken in schools by a local incident management team investigating suspected cases of omicron. But for all other pupils, isolation rules remain unchanged. Children are not required to self-isolate if they live in the same household as someone with Covid, as long as they are not a suspected or confirmed case of omicron. They are instead urged to take PCR tests to confirm their Covid status. More from News\u0026#39My fundamental freedoms are being ripped away\u0026#39: Readers on moving to Covid Plan BEU Commission plan allows police officers to cross borders, shoot and arrest suspectsPolitics latest news: Three Christmas parties to be investigated as pressure grows on Boris JohnsonNew Zealand bans young people from ever buying cigarettes shortly after making drug testing legalCovid latest news: Sajid Javid says no to \u0026#39unethical\u0026#39 mandatory vaccinationsConservative Party fined £17,800 over redecoration of Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Downing Street flatMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"time confront immorality lockdowns","story":"In the immediate aftermath of Christmas comes the feast of Thomas Becket, the most famous of turbulent priests, whose moral upbraiding of King Henry II resulted in his death.

Experts warned cases of the new strain are doubling in just . to three days - up from seven days for the Delta iant.People are urged to work from home from Monday, must wear face masks in more settings from Friday, produce the NHS Covid pass at big events from next Wednesday, and may get daily contact testing instead of isolation.It’s what the PM hoped not to do. He hoped he would not have to review restrictions until next week in time for their expiry on December .Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the change “has made the virus an even more formidable foe” and although there are only  confirmed Omicron cases in the UK, “we know the actual number of infections will be signicantly higher.”Mr Javid said the UK Health Security Agency estimates the number of infections “are approximately  times” those currently known - so closer to ,.  England’s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty added: “We know that it looked asit was going to evade vaccination. And now, clinically, we know that it can.” Yet Mr Javid was booed in the Commons as he introduced the work-from-home order - which has left Tory MPs furious. Tory MP William Wragg said vaccine passports “will create a segregated society” - and accused the PM of a dead cat to distract from the No party. “Very few will be convinced by this ersionary tactic”, he swiped. So what can and can’t you do  Here’s the full rundown of new rules. Mandatory vaccine passports for venues Under Plan B, certain venues will be forced to ask punters for an NHS Covid pass. Under previous plans only the vaccine part would be valid. People would no longer be able to show a negative test.But today Boris Johnson announced he is putting this plan into action from am on Wednesday  December - with a key change.Contrary to previous plans, he said “a negative lateral flow test will also be sufficient” to get you into a nightclub evenyou aren’t double-jabbed.  People who haven’t had the boosterwill still be eligible for now - but Mr Johnson said “we will keep this under review as the boosters roll out.” It’s thought venues affected will be all nightclubs, and other venues open after am with alcohol, music, and dancing. They also include:Indoor, crowded settings with  or more attendees where those attendees are likely to be in close proximity to people from other households, such as music venues or large receptions. Outdoor, crowded settings with , or more attendees where those attendees are likely to be in close proximity to people from other households, such as outdoor festivals. Any settings with , or more attendees, such as large sports and music stadia. Working from home Under plan B the government “would consider asking people to work from homethey can, for a limited period”, according to the September document. Today Boris Johnson announced that policy. He said: “We will reintroduce the guidance to work from home. “From Monday you should work from homeyou can. Go to workyou must but work from homeyou can.” The winter plan admitted: The Government recognises this causes more disruption and has greater immediate costs to the economy and some businesses than the other Plan B interventions.” But SAGE had warned it would be a key way of getting cases down. Mandatory face masks  Face masks have already been mandatory by law in England’s shops, supermarkets, gt shops, indoor shopping centres, public transport including taxis and indoor stations, banks and post offices since am on November . They are also compulsory at hair salons, barbers, nail salons, massage centres, tattoo and piercing studios. And theyaposre needed during driving tests and lessons - plus at pharmacies, vets, auction houses, retail galleries, takeaways , estate and lettings agents, high street solicitors and accountants. Tonight Boris Johnson announced they will be extended to “most public indoor venues including theatres and cinemas” too from .am this Friday. There will be exemptions for eating, drinking, exercising, and singing. For that reason, hospitality venues - including pubs and restaurants - will be completely exempt. Those who do not comply can be fined £ for a first offence , doubling on each repeat offence up to £,. Police will be expected to enforce the rules. Daily contact testing New rules say any contact of a suspected Omicron case must isolate for  days. But that could cause a pingdemiccases surge to a million in total by the end of the month, as Sajid Javid warned they could. Therefore Boris Johnson said the government will introduce daily tests for contacts instead of isolation. He did not say when. Face masks in schools At the end of November, secondary schools in England were recommended to ask pupils to wear masks in communal areas and corridors. There are reports of talks ongoing about whether to extend this. However there was no immediate announcement. New foreign travel rules Since November , all arrivals in the UK from anywhere in the world have had to take a paid-for PCR test within  hours of their arrival - and isolate until the result comes back negative. Since yesterdaythey have also had to take another pre-departure test before they board their flight back to the UK. Previously, vaccinated travellers only had to take a lateral flow Day  test, and did not have to isolate. The new rules apply even to the double-jabbed. Arrivals who land without having booked a Day  test in advance can be fined £, on the spot. Eleven countries were also added to England’s red list, forcing all arrivals into hotel quarantine costing £, a head for  nights. They include South Africa, Zimbabwe and Nigeria. Boris Johnson did not announce any extension to this tonight. ‘Clear communications’ This is where Plan B gets vaguer. The Winter Plan said the government would ensure it “communicates clearly and urgently to the public that the level of risk has increased, and with it the need to behave more cautiously.” Boris Johnson today gave some of that messaging as ministers warned of the rapid doubling time of the virus. When will Plan B end  The measures announced today will be reviewed on January  and the government will update Parliament. Regulations will then “sunset” on January , Sajid Javid told MPs. But both of these days could be brought forward or pushed back so they’re not actually massively relevant. Don’t forget the original lockdown was only for three weeks. We can glean some information from the criteria for triggering Plan B in the first place. Key questions the government would ask include:Is the NHS in danger of being overwhelmed This crucially isn’t just about cases - hospitalisations and deaths are more important. Key metrics include “hospital occupancy for COVID- and non-COVID- patients, intensive care unitcapacity, admissions in vaccinated iniduals, and the rate of growth of admissions.The link between hospitalisation and infections: The winter plan says the Government is monitoring the ratio of cases to hospitalisations and also the proportion of admissions due to infections among other factors. It also states ministers are keeping an eye on how many people over -years-old are catching Covid- or ending up in hospital.Vaccine efficacy and immunity: A major booster campaign for the over-s and the most vulnerable started in September, but there are some calls for it to be stepped up. Crucial will be whether immunity across the population is waning, or whether it’s being kept strong by the booster programme.The impact of new iants: In recent months the threat of a new, more deadly or more infectious iant appears to have faded. But that doesn’t mean it won’t emerge in future months, and the government now has a sequencing infrastructure that will attempt to spot them as they appear.Could it go further  Yes. Boris Johnson has refused to rule out lockdown measures at Christmas - or, as some scientists fear is more likely, in January when Omicron surges. Some have warned the Plan B measures above are pretty minimal overall. In particular,cases rise too high, you might need much stricter measures to actually bring cases down, rather than keep them stable or rising more slowly. The Plan B document in September said: “While the Government expects that, with strong engagement from the public and businesses, these contingency measures should be sufficient to reverse a resurgence in autumn or winter, the nature of the virus means it is not possible to give guarantees. “The Government remains committed to taking whatever action is necessary to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed but more harmful economic and social restrictions would only be considered as a last resort.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DeltaConservative PartyNHSPlan BBoris JohnsonEducationHospitalsPublic transportShopping centresSecondary schoolThe economyPoliticsChristmas shoppingChristmas party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Office snogging and groping while we were meant to social distance, and now banned Christmas parties.We’ve known for some time that when it comes to ­lockdown and Covid, it’s one rule for us and another for them. Time and time again the Government has shown complete disregard for their own rules and utter contempt for the public. Their mantra is do as we say not as we do.And now, we know not only did they break their own rules, they were laughing their heads off at us while they were doing it.Through the excellent reporting of Daily Mirror Political Editor Pippa Crerar, we learned that last year there was a Christmas party at No Downing Street.From the very place we were given orders about what to do and how to behave, No staff were having a jolly knees-up with cheese and wine and Secret Santa.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  All this while families across the country were unable to say proper goodbyes to their dying loved ones, and people couldn’t see their ­families because of Covid restrictions – by that point I hadn’t seen my own family for several months. A few days earlier, while children faced a Christmas under lockdown rules, staff at the Department for Education got together for a party with “drinks and canapes”. Not even Armando Iannucci could have come up with something as ­unimaginable as this in a ­plotline for political spoof The Thick of It. On Tuesday, a leaked video emerged of Downing Street aides laughing and joking about a rule-breaking Christmas party with one saying the “fictional” party was a “business meeting”. The country is fuming. We are being taken for absolute mugs. We know it, they know it, heck, even Ant and Dec know it. The behaviour of people who are supposed to be in charge is an absolute insult to everyone who made sacrices and followed the rules. Leadership is about being an example to others, sacrice, and putting other people before yourself. Just ask the Queen, who at , sat alone in church to bury Prince Philip, her husband of more than  years.It’s a disgrace. I’d like to think there will be consequences, but there won’t. At Prime Minister’s Questions, Boris announced some sort of “investigation”. Once again they’re marking their own homework.Johnson’s spokeswoman Allegra Stratton has resigned and a few people may be fired, but now it just feels like they’re moving the ­deckchairs on the Titanic.People will not forget this in a hurry. Let’s see who’s laughing come the next election. Find lost kids living in pain Like Susanna Reid on GMB this week, I was moved to tears listening to the grandmother of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes talk about how her attempts to save the little boy were ignored. She said: “Something is broken in this system and something needs fixing.”  I have a son the same age as Arthur and I just can’t imagine how anyone, let alone his own father and stepmother, could be so wicked and cruel. Hearing how he suffered is heartbreaking. According to schools inspector Ofsted, there are thousands of so-called “ghost children” who have vanished from the UK education system.  Something must be done immediately to ensure they aren’t in harm’s way. If that means a massive recruitment drive for more social workers then so be it. This can never be allowed to happen again.

The Health Secretary said “I hope not” to introduce even more rules to crack down on the surge of the more transmissible iant. But he was unable to give a guarantee. It comes after he smashed his own previous review date for restrictions and brought in two sets of rules less than a fortnight apart.People in England are urged to work from home from Monday, must wear face masks in cinemas and theatres from Friday, and must produce the NHS Covid pass at big events from next Wednesday.Face masks were already required in shops and on public transport and there were new rules on inbound travellers to the UK. Read More All the measures will now be reviewed on January , meaning they will be in place over Christmas. But scientists have raised doubts over what will happen after the New Year.SAGE member Prof Neil Ferguson said yesterday, before the launch of Plan B: “At the moment itaposs very dficult to rule out anything we really havenapost got a good enough handle on the threat.If the consensus is itaposs highly likely that the NHS is going to be overwhelmed then it will be for the Government to decide what it wants to do about that but itaposs a dficult situation to be in of course. Itcertainly might be possible at the current time. SAGE papers released last night warned the number of hospitalisations from Omicron may reach “, per day or higher” in England by January . It is currently just over . SAGE added: “The peak is highly likely to be higher than , to , Omicron hospital admissions per day without intervention.” Prof Paul Hunter, epidemiologist at the University of East Anglia, said he was pessimistic the strategy would work to curb infections. Advice to the government has warned cases of the new strain are doubling in just . to three days - up from seven days for the Delta iant.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the change “has made the virus an even more formidable foe” and although there are only  confirmed Omicron cases in the UK, “we know the actual number of infections will be signicantly higher.”Mr Javid said the UK Health Security Agency estimates the number of infections “are approximately  times” those currently known - so closer to ,. Asked by Sky NewsEngland was looking at more restrictions in January, Mr Javid replied: “No - I hope not.” He added: “I think the action we’ve taken now is very decisive, I think it’s going to make a big dference it’s not something anyone would do lightly. “It will have a real impact on people, be dficult for many people. But I hope people would understand it’s better to take this action now than see the rate spread and increase.” The Health Secretary said modelling indicated there could be one million UK Omicron cases by the turn of the new yearrestrictions were not re-introduced.Mr Javid said the deployment of Plan B was to buy time to assess the new coronavirus iant and to build our protective defences. NHS Providers chief Chris Hopson - who represents hospital bosses - told ITV ’s Peston: “Weaposre now looking at months - three, four, five months - where weaposre under really, really relentless pressure right the way across the piece.“And thataposs as you were saying with about , hospitalised Covid patients. “Clearlywe see those numbers signicantly increase, one problem is that itaposs potentially going to be in early to mid January which is the point at which the NHS is always under greatest pressure. “And we know also weaposve got massive, massive workforce pressures at the moment, in terms of weaposve got a very very tired workforce.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DeltaConservative PartyNHSUniversity of East AngliaNew YearPlan BPaul HunterHospitalsPublic transportPoliticsChristmas shoppingChristmas partyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

So where’s MY choice It is estimated by a charity that , children have long CovidImage: Getty Images iStockphotoopinionByPolly Hudson:,  Dec | commentsAt first it seemed sensible. Then insulting. Now  Scandalously negligent. Primary school age children in this country currently have the highest infection rates they’ve ever had during the pandemic - but there are no plans to start vaccinating them. Nearly five million - year olds have been jabbed in America, on Sunday the scheme was approved in Australia, and the rollout is expected to start next week in some European countries after it was given the green light by the European Medicines Agency. But here, nothing.Some parents won’t want their kids to be vaccinated of course, and that’s their choice - but I do, desperately. So where’s MY choice I’d take my seven-year-old to a back street illegal vaccinatorsuch a thing existed, but unfortunately it doesn’t.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Omicron is only just getting started, and already a whopping , kids tested positive for covid last week, with actual infection levels estimated to be up to four times higher than that. Charity Long Covid Kids reports that , children currently have long covid - , of whom have been suffering with it for over a year.Respected epidemiologist and public health researcher Deepti Gurdasani puts it simply, “Infection of children with SARS-Cov- will be one of those actions we look back at in history and wonder how on earth it was allowed to happen - by those who should’ve been protecting them.” I’ve gratefully accepted every vaccine my son has been offered, starting when he was eight weeks old. I’m lucky to live in a country where they’re available as standard, for free. And I believe it’s my duty to ensure he’s up to date with them, in accordance with the No part of parenting: trying to keep your kid safe. Also of course in this case, where coronavirus is still circulating, jabbing everyone means the whole community is protected. It’s better for everyone. The news about Omicron is becoming ever more concerning, and there were already upwards of , Covid cases a day before it reared its unwelcome head. And yet, every morning, I deliver my son into an environment where he mixes freely with hundreds of others, with no mitigations. No masks, no bubbles, no ventilation. And no vaccine either. Best of British luck, eh, kid  Vaccinating children was approved in the US at the end of October. Prof Jon Levy, chairman of the Department of Environmental Health at Boston University, welcomed the news: “Every paediatrician I know is eager to get their own kids age - vaccinated immediately. “They plan to get as many kids vaccinated in their offices as quickly as possible. If that doesn’t tell you how safe and effective the vaccine is. I don’t know what will.” If the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation know something we don’t – and have good reason why they’re dragging their feet on protecting the smallest, most helpless people in our communities – they need to speak up. Otherwise, they’re forcing us to fail our children.

The Prime Minister said a national conversation on how to live with the virus will likely be required as the country canapost keep going indefinitely with non-pharmaceutical interventions.It came as he announced Plan B restrictions in a televised address amid outrage over Christmas parties held last December in Downing Street and at the Tory headquarters as restrictions were in force in London.The PM faced anger from Tory MPs after he hastily triggered a switch to Plan B to tackle the Omicron iant as Downing Street was engulfed in a fresh crisis. He announced on Wednesday that work-from-home guidance will , Covid health certicates are to become mandatory in large venues and mask rules will be extended to combat the rapidly-spreading strain in England.  But despite the strengthening of the rules he said Christmas parties and nativities could go ahead, as he set out the move while under increasing pressure over the event in No  last December. Conservative backbenchers openly questioned the Government’s “credibility” in being able to enforce the rules while so many believed Downing Street had breached them. On the topic of compulsory vaccination, Mr Johnson said there has to be a “national conversation” as the country cannot go on imposing restrictions because a proportion of the population arenapost jabbed. He said: I didnapost want us to have a society and a culture where we force people to get vaccinated. I think that there is going to come a point...we can show that the vaccine is capable of holding Omicron, thataposs the key thing that I think we need to test. I do think we are going to have to have a conversation about ways in which we deal with this pandemic. I want to be absolutely clear, I donapost believe we can keep going indefinitely with non-pharmaceutical interventions, I mean, restrictions on peopleaposs way of le, just because a substantial proportion of the population still sadly has not got vaccinated. I think weaposre going to need to have a national conversation about the way forward and the other things that we can do to protect those who are hard to reach who havenapost got vaccinated for one reason or another.  That is a stage I think we will come toand when we establish that the booster is effective against Omicron. We will have to talk seriously about moving on. Mandatory mask wearing will be extended to indoor public venues including cinemas, theatres and places of worship from Friday but will not be required in pubs and restaurants, while the guidance to work from home where possible willon Monday.The NHS Covid pass, which can be obtained by having two vaccines or a negative lateral flow test, will be introduced for entry into nightclubs and other large venues from December , as Mr Johnson set out the “proportionate and responsible” measures.But he was forced to insist the public understands the “vital importance” of the measures as he faced continued questions over events in the run up to last Christmas and Downing Street’s denials that the gathering on December  amounted to a party.Announcing the restrictions simultaneously in the Commons, Health Secretary Sajid Javid was told to “resign” by senior Tory William Wragg as the party row added to anger and fears that public support for the Conservatives had further “taken a hit” following the Owen Paterson affair.Conservative former chief whip Mark Harper added: “What I am really concerned about is that it is unquestionably the case that over the last few weeks the Government’s credibility, whether it is on Paterson or on the Christmas parties, has taken a hit. “Why should people at home listening to the Prime Minster and the Secretary of State do things that people working in Number  Downing Street are not prepared to do ” At the Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson denied suspicions he had brought forward the announcement to ert attention from the row and the leaked video showing No  staff laughing about restrictions after the alleged party, which forced the resignation of Government aide Allegra Stratton. “You’ve got to act to protect public health when you’ve got the clear evidence,” the Prime Minister said. Mr Javid said the new restrictions were being imposed “with a heavy heart” but insisted they were necessary as he said there are  cases of Omicron confirmed in the UK, but that the true figure is estimated to be “probably closer to ,”.  He said they would be reviewed on January , before their expiry date of January . The Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieswarned Omicron is spreading “rapidly” and it is possible hospital admissions from the new iant in England could exceed , per day – and still be increasing – by the end of the year. “The overall scale of any wave of hospitalisations without interventions is highly uncertain, but the peak could reach several times this level,” the minutes from a meeting held on Tuesday said. Kate Nicholls, the head of trade body UKHospitality, warned of “catastrophic” results without Government support for the sector, while unions called for furlough measures to . Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: “Requiring people to work from home over the busy Christmas period will hit jobs – unless ministers bring back furlough.” Covid health certicates will apply to unseated indoor venues with more than  attendees, and outside where there are more than , people. The Prime Minister said passes can be obtained with a negative lateral flow test or by having had two doses of a vaccine, but hinted this could change by saying “we will keep this under review as the boosters roll out”. MPs are expected to be given a vote on the measures on Tuesday, during which a number of Tory rebels who have been angered by restrictions are poised to oppose the Government.But shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said Labour would “put public health first” and support the measures, meaning they will almost certainly be approved in the Commons, as he accused the Prime Minister of having “undermined public trust and confidence” at a “critical time”. “It’s quite clear Boris Johnson simply isn’t up to the job and Conservative MPs need to ask themselves whether they are happy for this man to continue being our Prime Minister,” he told reporters.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus vaccineBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The further damaging details emerged as Labour urged police to open an investigation into allegations No  staff broke coronavirus rules with a Christmas party in Downing Street last year, saying it was “implausible” for Scotland Yard to suggest there is insufficient evidence.Itaposs understood the event was held by Mr Baileyaposs campaign team, who were working in the basement at the time. A Tory spokesman said: “Senior CCHQstaff became aware of an unauthorised social gathering in the basement of Matthew Parker Street organised by the Bailey campaign on the evening of December . “Formal disciplinary action was taken against the four CCHQ staff who were seconded to the Bailey campaign”. As the Prime Minister announced Plan B restrictions to slow the spread of Omicron, he confirmed a Whitehall probe would be held into a party held on December , and any evidence of rule-breaking would be available to any police investigation. The Whitehall probe will focus on the bash at which officials had drinks, nibbles and party games, including a Secret Santa, late into the night. The PM on Wednesday finally apologised unreservedly over a No Christmas party - but denied all responsibility, continued to claim he was told rules were followed, and threw his own staff under the bus. Mr Johnson said he was sickened and furious at a clip of his own staff laughing about a Christmas bash four days after it happened last December, when lockdown rules banned social gatherings. Mr Johnson faced calls to extend the investigation to include a leaving do on November , . It is claimed Mr Johnson gave a speech and his former senior aide Lord Lister was thereAnd he was also asked about claims, which he denied, from Dominic Cummings that there was a smaller gathering in the Downing Street flat Mr Johnson shares with we Carrie.Sources told the Mirror that senior No  aides “were all drinking their socks off” at the alleged gathering on November  last year. Downing Street staff reported hearing “loud music pumping out of the flat” late into the night after Mr Cummings, the PM’s former top aide, had walked out of No . A spokeswoman for Carrie Johnson dismissed the claims as “total nonsense”. The Department for Education’s top official announced that Gavin Williamson’s staff party in the run-up to last Christmas will also be investigated by the Cabinet Secretary. No also faces questions over a report by the BBC into a Christmas quiz that took place in person at the Cabinet Office with No staff joining in.Mr Johnson said he had asked Cabinet Secretary Simon Case to look at allegations relating to December , rather than at any other dates. Any aides found guilty of breaking the rules would face disciplinary action. One of the PM’s most senior aides Allegra Stratton tearfully quit after leaked footage showed her laughing and joking about a Christmas party and Covid rules while the rest of the country faced restrictions. Mr Johnson claimed he was “furious” about the leaked footage of Ms Stratton. The politan Police acknowledged it had received “a signicant amount of correspondence” relating to the alleged breaches in No  in the run up to Christmas last year but said they do not “provide evidence of a breach” of Covid rules. “Based on the absence of evidence and in line with our policy not to investigate retrospective breaches of such regulations, the Met will not commence an investigation at this time,” it added. But the force did leave open the possibility of further inquiries by saying it would consider “any evidence” that emerges in the Case inquiry. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said the Met should be “knocking on doors, taking statements and investigating people in No  in the way they would my constituents or anyone  in the country”. “It seems implausible for the politan Police to argue there is no evidence that parties took place,” he told reporters. “They’ve got to pursue this investigation without fear or favour and treat the Prime Minister and his staff as they would treat anyone . It can’t be one rule for the Prime Minister and another for everyone .” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyShaun BaileyBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Prime Minister added “I donapost believe we can keep going indefinitely” with lockdown measures “just because” many people are not vaccinated. But Tory MP Angela Richardson, a government aide, tweeted: “I can say categorically that compulsory vaccinations are a step too far. “That is my contribution to a national conversation.”And today Mr Javid branded mandatory jabs “unethical” - except for NHS and care home staff, where he has pushed them through as a condition of the job.He told BBC Breakfast: “The Prime Minister would probably agree with me about mandatory jabs.“I don’t think there’s a need for a debate on mandatory jabs at all. “Perhaps the Prime Minister was just referring to what we’ve already set out in Parliament, in certain high risk settings and the requirements for NHS and social care workers to vaccinate, and I think that is important.” Mr Johnson made the remarks in last night’s press conference. He said: I didnapost want us to have a society and a culture where we force people to get vaccinated. I think that there is going to come a point...we can show that the vaccine is capable of holding Omicron, thataposs the key thing that I think we need to test. I do think we are going to have to have a conversation about ways in which we deal with this pandemic.  I want to be absolutely clear, I donapost believe we can keep going indefinitely with non-pharmaceutical interventions, I mean, restrictions on peopleaposs way of le, just because a substantial proportion of the population still sadly has not got vaccinated. I think weaposre going to need to have a national conversation about the way forward and the other things that we can do to protect those who are hard to reach who havenapost got vaccinated for one reason or another. That is a stage I think we will come toand when we establish that the booster is effective against Omicron. We will have to talk seriously about moving on.  The comments worsened a Tory revolt Mr Johnson is already facing for bringing in vaccine passports in nightclubs and crowded venues to tackle Omicron. The PM made a last-minute tweak to the passports plan that will allow unvaccinated people into venuesthey show a negative test result. The PM also announced work-from-home guidance willfrom Monday, and mask laws will be extended to more settings in England from .am on Friday. But Conservative backbenchers openly questioned the Government’s “credibility” in being able to enforce the rules after last year’s Downing Street party. The Health Secretary admitted he pulled out of a round of TV interviews on Wednesday because he was upset by a video in which No staff joked about the bash. Mr Javid said he was against universal mandatory Covid- vaccinations. Speaking to Sky News, the Health Secretary said: Iaposve got no interest in mandatory vaccinations, apart from in high-risk settings in the NHS and social care, which weaposve already set out that we will legislate for. Other than that,you talk about universal mandatory vaccination, I think ethically it is wrong but also, at a very practical level, it just wouldnapost work. Getting vaccinated has to be a positive decision. Asked whether more restrictions could be coming in January due to social mixing occurring over the Christmas period, he did not rule it out. Mr Javid replied: I hope not. The action weaposve taken is very decisive, I think it is going to make a big dference.

Anthony Nolan’s struggle with deadly Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome and his mum Shirley’s tireless campaign to save him by finding a suitable bone marrow donor moved the world. Shirley established the world’s first register of volunteer donors here in the UK. Tragically, she never did find a suitable match for Anthony and he died when he was seven years old. But the register became his legacy, recruiting donors around the world. Their bone marrow and stem cells have saved more than , patients with leukaemia and other blood disorders. Alan Corby spent six months in the next isolation room to Anthony at Westminster Children’s Hospital. Neither were expected to survive. Alan said: “Much of the time he was the only person I could see. We would talk and play card games like Twist through the glass. “When I was well enough I moved to my local hospital. I went back to see Anthony a few months later, but he had passed away.  “His le may have been short, but it had an incredible impact. Thousands have been given a second chance of le thanks to him and his mum.” On what would have been Anthony’s th birthday, the Mirror meets three boys given hope of beating deadly blood diseases by his legacy.Visit anthonynolan.org for more information or to join the donor register.Georgie McAvoy knows the heartache Shirley Nolan endured searching for a donor to save her son. Because her little boy Daniel was born with the same rare disease that killed Anthony. Daniel, two, has Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome which prevents his blood cells from fighting infection and clotting properly. His only hope is a bone marrow transplant to reset his immune system. A first transplant in June last year failed as Daniel body rejected his donor cells and relapsed.  He is now preparing to undergo another gruelling course of chemotherapy, followed by a second transplant and will spend Christmas recovering in hospital. Georgie, , said: “We have been through so much, but Daniel is still fighting. He has coped with everything that has been thrown at him and he keeps smiling. “We are so grateful for the donor register and everything that Shirley Nolan did – it is the reason that Daniel is still alive.” Daniel’s parents realised something was wrong when he began suffering nosebleeds and they found blood in his nappy when he was three weeks old.He then developed sepsis and spent  days fighting for his le in intensive care.Georgie and dad Andrew, , even asked the hospital chaplain to christen Daniel is his cot as they feared he might not survive.  Georgie, from Huntingdon in Cambridge, said: “The doctors told us he needed a bone marrow transplant to save his le, but that some children didn’t make it to transplant. “It was devastating. We didn’t knowhe would start to walk or go to school. I remember thinking, ‘I need him to be christened in case something happens.’ “It was emotional. Daniel’s big sister Holly wore a christening gown made from my wedding dress and I’d planned for Daniel to wear it too, but that obviously wasn’t possible. Daniel was eventually diagnosed with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects one in every one million boys, in May last year after an unrelated hernia operation. Neither his parents nor Holly, four, were a suitable match, so their only hope was to find a donor through the stem cell register, which the charity Anthony Nolan managed within two months.  Daniel was due to undergo the transplant in March last year, but his procedure was postponed after the Covid pandemic began for fear there would be a shortage of doctors, nurses, or beds. Georgie said: “That was really scary. Daniel had been through all his preparation and we were ready to go, then everything blew up before our eyes. We didn’t know what would happen.” Daniel continued to deteriorate, picking up more infections until his transplant finally went ahead at Great Ormond Street Hospital at the end of June as doctors “could not risk waiting any longer”. He was only allowed one parent with him as he underwent chemotherapy to remove his immune system ahead of the transplant.  Daniel ed home in August but suffered a drug relating seizure, then graft versus host disease as his body tried to reject the donor cells and spent last Christmas in hospital. Georgie said: “The last two relapses have been particularly dficult. During the last one he began vomiting digested blood. His stomach had to be drained constantly. “At that point they said there were no more options, we had to do another transplant and we needed a dferent donor as his body had rejected the first. “It will be hard spending another Christmas in hospital, but we feel so lucky to have found another donor to give Daniel a second chance. That wouldn’t have happened without Anthony Nolan.” Time is running out for Ale Pinckney to find a lesaving stem cell donor. The eight year-old from Exeter relies on weekly blood transfusions to top up his critically low levels of platelets. That has bought Alfie more time, but his condition is getting worse. His desperate family know his only hope is a transplant, but his mixed British and Chinese heritage makes it harder to find a matching tissue type to prevent his body rejecting the donor cells.  Alfie’s mum Lily, said: “It’s so hard to watch your child in pain and be incapable of helping. It’s tearing me apart. Our only hope is to encourage as many people as possible to join the register.” Alfie developed Aplastic Anaemia when he was five years-old. It means his body cannot produce the platelets he needs for his blood to clot properly and he cannot fight infection. At the time his British-born parents Lily and Charles were living and working in Hong Kong. They ed to the UK just before lockdown last year to be near family and step up Alfie’s treatment – just like Shirley Nolan moved home from Australia to search for a donor for Anthony. They hoped they had found a donor earlier this year when a woman in Brazil was confirmed as a matching tissue type, but that fell through.  Since then, Alfie has continued to deteriorate as his body burns through the weekly platelet transfusions and he suffered a terrying haemorrhage. Dad Charles said: “He had a huge, uncontrollable nosebleed and bleeding from the gums. He was clutching the kitchen bin, vomiting blood, screaming “Daddy, help me”. “We rushed him into the high dependency unit and I was mopping blood of his arms, face, and torso as several doctors and nurses tried to keep him alive. It was harrowing. “It’s so easy to join the register. It only takes three minutes to swab your checks, then you can get on with your le. But that could help to save Mason or another child’s le.” Katie Jordan got the devastating news that little Mason had blood cancer on Christmas Eve last year. The only cure for his Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukaemia was a bone marrow transplant but mum Katie was not a good match, nor was anyone on the donor register. Most children with the disease only survive for  months after diagnosis. So Katie, a single mum like Shirley, launched her own campaign to save her son. Mason’s Mission raised nearly £, for Anthony Nolan, helping the charity to test the backlog of , swab samples that built up during the pandemic and add them to the donor register. Katie, from Stockton-on-Tees said: “I was living my worst nightmare. It was heartbreaking to think that Christmas could have been our last together. “I would give my le for Mason, but I wasn’t a match. So I did everything I could to find a donor.”  Thankfully Anthony Nolan did find a suitable donor two months later and Mason had a successful stem cell transplant in March this year. He was rushed back to hospital over the summer after developing blisters all over his body and spent a week fighting for his le in intensive care before they subsided. But the two year-old made a full recovery and is now looking forward to a happy, healthy Christmas. Katie said: “We were lucky that we found a donor so quickly. When they told us, I couldn’t stop crying. I would love to meet his donor one day and thank them.

He pulled through but the sepsis caused severe damage in his limbs, causing the tissue in his hands and feet to die.His mum Karina Kolek, , has now opened up on her heartbreaking ordeal - and says she will do whatever it takes to get him the operation he desperately needs. She has vowed to fundraise cash for a potentially le-changing treatment that could give Jakub a chance to be normal. She said: I remember those moments when Jakub was first ill so clearly. I was scared by the way my son looked. His arms and legs were black. I was mad with despair, fear, pain, helplessness - it is impossible to describe. My child was dying before my eyes. The doctors said they did not knowhe would make it. At one point, only his heart was still beating. So I prayed. Fortunately, God gave my son one more le and Jakub had enough strength to survive. Medics discovered he has damaged growth cartilages after he underwent some reconstructive surgery.  That will require further operations to help him to walk without pain - but it will cost £,. Single mum-of-two Karina has launched a fundraiser for further reconstructive treatment from a specialist team in Poland. She added: Some of his fingers could not be saved but his feet suffered the most. That is where the greatest tissue loss is. I am fighting for my son because I believe this is the only chance he will have tolike other children. If Jakub does not get this surgery soon, it may result in more damage to the skin.  Not only will that cause more pain - but in the worst case may lead to Osteomyelitis, a type of swelling in the bone, which could make him seriously ill again. In a plea for help towards his treatment Karina said: Iaposm a mother with two children, alone, and I will cannot cope with it on my own. Jakub survived, but he is crippled.

Adele Thaxter, , said her mixed-race son Lucas Roberts was also called the aposn wordapos by the player, YorkshireLive reports.Adele, from Doncaster, filed a complaint with the police, however she was told officers did not have enough evidence to act, she said.The alleged racist abuse took place when Lucas was playing for Hyde Park Knights Us against the Doncaster-based Edlington White Stars in April.A complaint was also lodged with the Sheffield and Hallamshire FA to look into.  Adele claims the FA have now told her the club will faces charges and may face disciplinary action including an equality course. However, the club insist they have no case to answer and face no charges. Mum-of-three Adele said: “He’d tackled one of their players a couple of times, he said there was some pushing and shoving. “When he tackled one of their players again near the end, he was called the ‘n wordapos. “There was a scuffle and some of our parents tried to break it up. “The mother of the boy he was scuffling with shouted ‘get off him you f*****g P**i. “He was in tears, he was shaking.

She added: “The police said the only way they could carry on the investigation was to arrest the young boy and question him and I didn’t want that. “It’s not his fault.

She said the club missed an opportunity to acknowledge the incident and address the issue of racism. She said: “This was a chance for them to admit there’s a problem and tackle racism in junior football. Instead, they swept it under the carpet. “The worst thing for Lucas was the statement they put online. It said they’d been found innocent and there was no case to answer. “He was somewhere they were supposed to safeguard him. “I felt angry, I felt powerless. I grew up in the s and s and experienced racism, you don’t expect the same to happen to your children. “It made me feel like when you speak out about it, you’re shut down and these people make you out to be a liar. “I’m glad the FA are taking this action. The most important message for me is that I want to give people confidence to stand up and speak out about racism.” It is understood Edlington White Stars will now have to answer the charges levelled against them ahead of an inquiry which will determine sanctions against the club. Sheffield and Hallamshire FA said: FA series have received the case papers and a commission is looking at this and will decide appropriate sanction for the club. Edlington White Stars was contacted for comment. A spokesman for the club refused to comment other than to say the club is not facing any action.

Kriss attached a letter to a new collar they had bought for Jeff in order to inquire about his home le situation. The letter read: “Hi. This cat has owner  He come to me everyday for food, talk, water and sleep. What happened to him on right side chest  All is ok  Much love!”  Jeffaposs owner Jessica Cowan was in stitches when she saw the note, and was happy to explain the reason for the missing fur. Jeff had a patch missing due to having a blood sample taken as he was losing weight, she explained. The note solved the mystery of why Jeff had been piling on the pounds following the vets visit. Jessica says that she is happy Jeff is making friends and wants him to continue visiting Kriss. Jessica said: “Recently Jeffrey made a few pals in the area. He came home on Monday afternoon with a little note wrapped around his “new” collar. I got a fright and shouted on my mum and dad because I thought I had let the wrong cat in the house. I was chasing this cat all about the kitchen. I ended up grabbing the cat and noticed it was Jeffrey and cut the note off the collar. “I was shocked but I started laughing afterwards because I had recently taken him to the vet as he was a little underweight due to refusing to eat or drink water.  So he got put on antibiotics and had a shaved patch where he got blood taken. “I noticed he put weight back on. I just never took notice of it. But when I saw the message I was happy because when I’m out and about or shopping he can have another home to go to and sit. I wrote a note back with my name and number. He’s not yet texted me but he sent a note back saying his name is Kriss and Jeffrey is a very special cat to him. “I was more than happy for Kriss to keep letting Jeffrey in because Jeff won’t give up trying to get in his house. The man sounds lovely and obviously loves Jeffrey just as much as I do. Jessica explained that sheaposs owned Jeff for the last nine years. We adopted him from a family friend because he wasn’t really enjoying the high rise flats he used to live in, she said. They got him from a cat rescue centre in Leith. “When we got him he was still a baby and very playful. The first night getting him he had attacked my hand and my auntie quickly lted him and put him outside. Around  minutes later he came knocking at the window and that was just the beginning of his tricks. “He tends to give my neighbours frights. The lady up the road came out of her shower and saw Jeffrey curled up in a ball sleeping. She screamed for her brother then we eventually got a knock on the door with Jeffrey in the manaposs arms with a disappointed face because he was caught. He’s known in the area as my dad and I’s cat as we are always out shouting for him but he always s shortly after we call. “When he comes home he tries his luck and opens the door by himself by jumping on the handle bar and lets himself in the house. He can never do any wrong - especially when my nieces and nephews are in the house. When he’s shouted at I crumble shortly after and give him all the cuddles and kisses because I spoil him.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cats\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A leaked video from last December shows key members of the PM’s team giggling as they held a mock press conference in the wake of the December  bash, exclusively revealed by the Daily Mirror. Here dismayed relatives recall how they followed the strict Covid lockdown – even in their darkest hours – while brazen No staff flouted the rules. Lobby Akinnola, who lost his social worker father Femi, , to Covid in April, said he feels a “deep sense of betrayal” and called for Downing Street to be held to account. The -year-old campaigner, from Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, said the Government’s attitude towards the reports has been “completely reprehensible” and labelled the Prime Minister a liar.  “I sat opposite Boris Johnson, he apologised and said he’d done everything he could [to prevent Covid deaths] and that was a lie. There’s no way to look at that and say it wasn’t, given what we’ve seen.” Lobby – whose father went to work in a woolly scarf and ski gloves because he was not provided with vital Personal Protective Equipment – said those involved in the parties “need to come forward”. “It’s important to note that the culture comes from the top down,” he added. “They were being reckless and what’s worse is they were doing it at Christmas, a time when they knew they had said to everyone that actually you can’t afford to be lax, we can’t afford for you to see your loved ones because the risk to le is too great. “Maybe they don’t hold our lives to the same value because they were like, ‘we can obviously have a party’. It’s just such a deep betrayal – they were supposed to look after us.” **** Sam Bateman’s dad Bob Smith died alone on December  last year after going into hospital with heart failure and a chest infection. Retail worker Sam, a le-long Conservative voter from Maidstone, Kent, said she will never again vote Tory after the video emerged. As the anniversary of her dad’s death approaches, Sam , , said she had begun to decorate her home and put on Christmas songs, “because it’s what dad would’ve wanted me to do”.  But after seeing the video, she feels only anger and sadness. “The video absolutely flawed me - just flawed me with grief and anger,” she told the Mirror. “When I saw that laughing, it was horric. It’s coming up to the anniversary and it’s just made it so much harder to cope with. “When you cannot be there when your parent dies, it’s incredibly dficult to deal with and the video just hit me like a wave.“The ironic thing was that my dad voted for Boris Johnson and voted Conservative all his le. So have I. But I never will again. Never. Dominic Cummings was bad. This is something .“I didn’t know how my dad spent his last moments and I’ve spent  months imagining what happened. And then I see them laughing about a party they held at a time when I was losing my dad, my hero. It’s appalling. “I think now, after Dominic Cummings and everything , Boris Johnson needs to do the right thing and step down. It’s an absolute insult to the thousands of families who have suffered what we have.“ **** Trish Greenhalgh, a professor of primary care, told how she lost her -year-old mum Mary to covid on December . She died in the William Harvey Hospital in Kent. Trish, , told how her mum died without family by her side as they followed rules to ensure the safety of others. She told the she was “devastated” to see the video showing Allegra Stratton, Boris Johnson’s then-press secretary, laughing about the December  party with her colleagues. “It was a dficult death because hardly anyone was vaccinated at that time, so visiting people in hospital carried a high risk of catching covid and potentially transmitting it to others,” she said. To avoid that, none of the family visited my mother with the exception of my son who is a junior doctor and had had one jab. “Certainly one of the factors we took into account when deciding whether to visit mum in her final days was the responsibility not to spread the virus further. We weren’t allowed to visit her anyway until it was clear she was terminal – because of the hospital’s covid rules. “At that point we were permitted to visit but decided very reluctantly that the safest option for everyone was to send in my son but everyone  stay outside. “I was really devastated to see the video of Allegra Stratton and senior politicians joking about a party that appears to have taken place on the very day my mother became unwell with Covid. “They seemed completely unaware of the deep signicance of the sacrices my family and many many others were making – not attending a loved one to provide comfort and say our final goodbyes. “Memories of a Christmas party usually fade quickly - memories of an emotionally painful death never fade. Trish said on the day of the party her mum had called her “breathless and feverish”. She added: “She died without family by her side. I promise you, it wasn’t funny.” **** Jackie Green’s mum Beryl Harris, , died alone in hospital with Covid on the day of the alleged Downing Street Christmas party. She has called on Boris Johnson to resign after the leaked video footage emerged, saying officials’ attitude was “totally reprehensible”. She said: “It’s astonishing - just when you think that things can’t get any worse, something  happens.”  Mrs Harris, , had been shielding at her home in Wellesbourne,Warwickshire, since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, so had not seen her only child for  months by the time she was taken to hospital with anaemia.She was then struck down with Covid, but was said to have been on the mend and was due to be discharged on December  . But her condition suddenly worsened and she died on December  - the same day as the alleged staff party at No  where games were played, food and drinks were served, and revelries went on past midnight. Ms Green said the clip sent two messages to the public: “One is that the Government think they are above their own rules, and can behave in any manner in which they please. “And also, it’s saying ‘we don’t actually care about you’. “Some people placed their confidence in this Government when they voted them in - that confidence turns out to be severely misplaced.”She said she was so shocked by the footage of the press conference rehearsal, obtained by ITV News, that she watched it several times to let it “sink in”.She said: “I was absolutely appalled that members of the Government could laugh and joke about a party when people were losing their loved ones. “To put it mildly, it was inappropriate. It was totally reprehensible behaviour. If I’d have had a party, the police would have been knocking on my door, quite rightly so. “The flippancy with which that subjectwas dealt with was absolutely appalling.” Ms Green, who is part of the Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice which has campaigned for the public inquiry into the Government’s handling of the pandemic, said: “Where’s the integrity  They need to actually stand up and tell the truth. “And primarily, Boris Johnson needs to stand up and tell the truth. An apology is not nearly enough for those people that have lost loved ones to Covid, and families that are still suffering because of Covid. “Particularly because hehas denied this repeatedly, and his Government ministers have denied this repeatedly, it would seem like an insult to peoplehe apologised now. “He needs to tell the truth about what happened, he needs to put his hands up to it - have some integrity about the whole thing. The buck stops with him, he’s ultimately responsible. “It’s a serious breach of public trust and public confidence. Andthe Government were allowed to get away with this, it would be an absolute scandal.”  **** Rob Kelleher said his father Bob, , from South Shields was admitted to hospital on December  last year and subsequently died on January , without seeing a member of his family in person again. Mr Kelleher frm Norfolk said his -year-old mother Maureen and the rest of his family are reliving it all over again because of the news about activities in  Downing Street on the day his father was admitted. The -year-old said: “It was the date that triggered all of this because in our mind that is the very last day anybody’s seen my dad. “My mam is sitting at home not watching the telly or even having the radio on because she just can’t deal with this.”  **** Rachel Mewes, from New Hartley in Northumberland, has called on Mr Johnson to resign over the allegations. Rachel’s four-year-old daughter Betsy, who has Down’s Syndrome, is extremely vulnerable to coronavirus because of lung problems caused by her premature birth. However, Rachel says she is not surprised by the allegations. She said: “To be honest, it doesn’t even surprise me after everything that the Government has done. Isn’t that awful  It shows the dference between what they think of themselves and the working classes. “I feel for the families who have lost loved ones only now to find out the people making the rules were flaunting them. It’s disgusting. “My daughter lost all of her services and still doesn’t have all of them back. We have made huge sacrices. We’ve done as much as we possibly can. “It’s so disrespectful when you look at what people have gone through. “The Government don’t live in our world, they’re born with silver spoons.” **** On December  last year, Daisy Harris spoke to her terminally ill mum on Facetime from her hospice bed. It would be her last interaction with her. Helen Harris, , died without the comfort of her family after contracting coronavirus on the very day Downing Street held a Christmas bash. Daisy said of the leaked video: “I don’t really have words for it. Just absolute fury. “Our family and so many other families were suffering.” Helen was diagnosed with a grade four terminal brain tumour in , and had defied doctors who gave her an -month le expectancy. By December , she had been moved to a hospice where Daisy’s family live in Glasgow, Scotland. “I arrived home from university in Manchester to Scotland on December ,” Daisy said. “It was too late to see my mum so my dad put me on Facetime which was the last time I ever spoke to her. “The next day she was diagnosed with Covid. We could have come to see her and stood outside her window but we didn’t want to put extra pressure on the hospice.” The following day, on December , Daisy’s dad was woken up in the early hours by the hospice, who informed the family that Helen was not going to make it. “The government’s failure to lockdown early enough and the reopening in the summer before failing to lockdown early enough again was just shocking,” Daisy said. “Now finding out that they were breaking the rules themselves is heartbreaking. Seeing that video last night made me really upset. “The staff at the hospice were so visibly moved by my mum when those in power were just joking around like it didn’t mean anything to them. “It is coming up to a year since I lost my mum so I was already a bit fragile so this has really brought that home for me. “It has really shaken me up. “I would like to see resignations but what I would also really like to see is accountability,” she added.  Jane Roche’s father Vince Pettitt and older sister Jocelyn Pettitt died within a week of each other in April last year, during the first peak of the pandemic. Jane said: “I’m not happy with the heartbreak he has already caused. “Telling people to go and get their booster jabs is a kick in the teeth. I feel he is constantly letting us down.” Mrs Roche said she witnessed at first-hand the devastating consequences of Covid, having spent the agonising final hours of her father’s le with him in hospital, and having seen the impact it had on Jocelyn. Mrs Roche, of Castle Vale in Birmingham, said she did not accept the Prime Minister’s apology and has campaigned for a full public inquiry into the Government’s handling of the pandemic. The -year-old added: “The videodisgusted me. “How can anybody take them seriously when new measures come in ” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON FacetimeConservative PartyBob SmithBoris JohnsonHospitalsHeart diseaseLe expectancyPublic inquiryPoliticsChristmas partyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Strangely, for such an exceptional feature, it does not seem to have been documented until the end of the th century, and very little has been written about it since. Situated four metres back into the solid rock of the clf, a narrow tunnel opens out into a small chamber in which there sits a rock-cut bath, roughly one metre deep and always full.According toCornwall Live , the bath was built at the end of the s for the botanist John Stackhouse, who owned nearby Acton Castle. By the end of the th century, the benefits of bathing in sea water and in spring water were widely recognised by the aristocracy, and as a botanist spending time in the spa town of Bath with a special interest in marine algae, this growing health obsession did not escape the attention of Stackhouse. After he married Susanna Acton in , John Stackhouse had Acton Castle built above the remote Cornish cove where he found himself spending most of his time, studying seaweed and marine algae. At some point between  and Stackhouse had two rock-cut baths carved out for him down at the cove. Some say it was because he was suffering from rheumatism, others say that they were for his we, Susanna.  The first bath was a tidal seawater pool, cut into the rock on the beach with steps and a drain to keep the water at a constant level. These outdoor baths cut into rock at beaches can be found where in Cornwall, such as at Portreath, where there are seven of them. However, the second bath, inside a cave that had been carved out of the clf, with its own constant flow of natural spring water, was unlike anything . Roughly two metres above the beach, the entrance to this peculiar bath resembles an adit to a mine shaft- clearly man made in appearance, but with bright green moss and algae cascading out of it and down the rocks to the ground. Originally, there were steps cut into the rock, leading up to the entrance, but these have been worn away by the sea over time. The small tunnel, which is about cm wide and .m high, leads back into total darkness. The only clue of what is at the end is the dripping of the natural bath tap that has been left on for two centuries.  Venturing into the tunnel, as daylight fades, the rich greens and reds of the algal biofilms on the rock begin to glow. The floor of the tunnel is carpeted in a wet green moss. Four metres in, the tunnel opens out into the chamber which is almost entirely taken up by the bath, and has very little light, apart from that coming through the tunnel, and down from a man-made vertical shaft designed to feed the natural spring down into the bath. The first detailed documentation of Stackhouse’s cave bath is considered to be by Michael Tangye, when he wrote about ‘Rock-cut baths in Cornwall’ in the Cornwall Archaeological Society’s  booklet. In it, he writes: “This remarkable and unique feature lies within the rock clf face at the centre of the cove. Here, several feet above the beach level is a tunnel which at first glance resembles a mine adit outlet. It appears to have been originally approached by rock-cut steps ascending from the beach on the south side, of which only one, at the top, has survived sea erosion.”  Writing about the tunnel into the bath chamber, Tangye continues: “Pick marks can be seen on its walls. This leads into a rock-cut chamber ftsquare and fthigh. In its floor a rectangular bath has been sunk ftlong, ft inswide, and ftdeep. The vertical shaft that feeds the bath with slightly alkaline spring water is a sophisticated part of the design, and is described by Tangye as such: “In the north-west corner of the roof, a rectangular chimney-like shaft, again cut from the solid rock, ascends some ftto the clf top. Fresh water, from a small stream, drains into this, falls down the shaft, then through a hole in the stone roof of the chamber, ft insby ft ins , and into the bath beneath. The constant overflow drains along the approach tunnel to the exterior. This fresh water bath, situated within its dark, cold and secluded chamber must have been again created for John Stackhouse and Susanna, his we.” There have been suggestions that for such a sophisticated natural spring-fed bath system to be built, John Stackhouse would have employed experts from Bath, where he also chose his architect for Acton Castle. However, the local knowledge and skill of tunnelling into clfs in that area was unmatched at the time.  Stackhouse had appointed local man John Carter as caretaker and key holder of Acton Castle, and entrusted him with the property for the long periods when he was not there. But along with his brother, Harry, John Carter was a notorious smuggler, calling himself the ‘King of Prussia’ and creating a maze of smuggler’s tunnels on the south coast. Whether John Stackhouse was aware of Carter’s smuggling activities is unclear, but he would certainly have known his skill with a pick axe. Regardless of who built this hidden bathroom, it is unlikely to become popular again soon. Without the long exposures of the camera revealing the warm colours inside, the reality is that this space is cold, dark and teaming with spiders and marine bugs like sea slaters. With the steps eroded away, access is treacherous and the strange echoes inside the cave can be unnerving. But for an th century algae-loving botanist who wanted some privacy on his favourite beach, this bathroom would have been heaven.

He went on to deliver a letter to the home of Bristol mayor, Marvin Rees, claiming responsibility for the arson. In the letter the -year-old said he wanted the attack to be a warning to other venues. He later threw a brick through the window of the Barley Mow pub with a note attached claiming vaccine passports were a breach of human rights.  Then on August  this year Bristol nightclub Lakota received a handwritten saying it would “sustain substantial damage like SWX”it introduced Covid passports. Officers tracked the movements of a man seen starting the fire back to a shop where Marshall had bought a box of matches. He was subsequently identied following a public appeal and he was arrested. Marshall pleaded guilty to charges of arson being reckless as to whether le is endangered, criminal damage and making threats to cause criminal damage at a hearing at Bristol Crown Court in September. He was then sentenced for the three offences at the same court on Wednesday.  Following the sentencing PC David Stevenson said: “Owen Mashall’s actions were motivated by the completely misguided belief the venues he targeted were about to introduce Covid vaccine passports “His obsession with Covid restrictions ultimately led him to carrying out the extremely reckless attack on SWX and it is only through sheer luck no one was physically harmed. “Staff had been at the venue just hours before and they could easily still have been inside when he used an accelerant to start the fire. “More than  fire service personnel were also put at risk tackling the resulting blaze which took several hours to extinguish.aposapos  He added: “The attack has had a devastating impact on the club and the three businesses based below it with hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage and lost revenue caused. “These were businesses which had all suffered as result of the pandemic and which were looking forward to serving their community once more only for their livelihoods to again be put in jeopardy. “While Marshall has never explained his actions, I am pleased he ultimately accepted responsibility as it negated the need for a trial.” The attack on SWX took place a week before it was due to reopen in July following months of Covid restrictions. At the time Mayor Rees said it was such sad news for Bristolaposs night time economy as the industry sought to recover from a tough year.

Julie Simpson visited Cargo Fleet Social Club, in Middlesbrough, to cheer on her darts playing partner, only for members to allegedly shout get your lass out of here at her. The alleged yelling happened after Julie stepped foot in the bar - where women were not permitted - rather than the lounge area. But a club secretary has fired back, insisting rules are rules - and claimed they donapost let women enter the bar over fears they would be exposed to bad language or fighting. Julie, who has worked in hospitality since she was a teenager, said she felt humiliated by the incident, and is now questioning why, in , rules like this still exist. The drama unfolded on Sunday night, after teetotal Julie drove herself and her partner to the Middlesbrough club for the darts league match.  She said: We both went to the bar to order our drinks, and the next thing we knew we were being shouted at - they were shouting aposget your lass out of here! Get your lass out of here! Sheaposs not allowed in here so get her out!apos It was really degrading - I just thought to myself what the heck  And it was just normal customers bellowing at me. But there was a woman barmaid in there, and as I was talking to her she just told me that they are aposold fashioned in hereapos.” Julie said she was left feeling about “two foot tall”. She continued: “I turned to my other half and said aposlook, play your darts and Iaposll come back and pick you up - but he said no. I go everywhere with him, and Iaposve never experienced anything so horrible. It was disgusting. Julie claimed there were no posters on the clubaposs wall explaining the rules, nor did the barmaid flag it up.  Yet for the clubaposs secretary Brian Wilson, her gripes fall flat. He insists the venue is all about inclusiveness, citing the -plus women who drink there as guests - although as non-members they arenapost allowed a vote. They get a card, and they are allowed to go to the Christmas party - it is all free for them - and it seems the only person who is complaining is a woman from a dferent club, he said. And I think sheaposs bulls******g, as we have a lady who plays five and threes every Wednesday, and she comes and sits in the same room as . He believes her claims are an attempt to give the club a bad name - and insists the rules are there more to shield women from the antics of boozed-up blokes. He added: It is an old fashioned working menaposs club and we donapost think it is rightwhen there are men effing and blinding in the bar - it isnapost right when there are ladies sitting there. When askedwomen are incapable of handling hearing swear words, he added: Well some would. Butyou had a couple in on a night out, and a fight breaks out at the bar, it isnapost very nicetables are going over. We donapost have no lady members in the club, they are all guests and we have a dart room and we allow them to sit in the dart room. But because of the bad language situation and the drunken situation, we donapost like women in the bar. Legally, the  Equality Act allows clubs or organisations to restrict membership to people who share a protected characteristic - which includes gender. Brian said the club aims to make women feel welcome. We have plenty of room for them, we have a great big lounge for them with music and bingo on. Butthey do come with an away darts team, we do allow them to sit inbut we do not allow them to go to the bar, unless they go to the bar in the lounge. He suspects the club is one of around three of four local venues that still prohibit women from entering the bar area. The clubaposs rules mean women can visit as guests - but canapost be full fee-paying members. He added that they enjoy all the perks of the club, apart from access to certain parts as well as the vote given to the men who pay subs. He added: Our other lady members donapost have a problem with it, so I donapost see why someone from another place should. We do a lot for the community. We have a Christmas party for the pensioners - all women - they are not members but we pay for it They get £ each, a good feed and a turn on. Weaposve never had one complaint from a woman in this club. So for someone to come from another club and complain - I just canapost believe it. Yet Julie couldnapost believe she had fallen victim to rules she thought had vanished decades ago. And she has also questioned that,the venue is so concerned about women hearing bad language, why they would employ female barmaids. What happened would be degrading to any woman. The more I think about it, the more I feel discriminated against and degraded,” she said. To be shouted out, and told no women in here - I just donapost understand.

And today, she appeared to offer a glimpse of an adorable previously unseen picture of herself posing with the late Prince Philip alongside some of their great-grandchildren.It came as the Monarch was presenting the Queenaposs Medal for Music to concert organist Thomas Trotter during an audience at Windsor Castle this morning. The cute framed snap could be seen on a side table resting alongside her trusty black handbag.Andyou look closely it appears to show the Queen and Philip sitting on a sofa with the Queen holding a young Princess Charlotte on her knee.It seems as though Prince George is standing behind them with Isla Phillips - daughter of Peter Phillips - to the side of Her Majesty. Mia Tindall - the daughter of Zara and Mike Tindall - appears to sit in between her great-grandparents with Savannah Phillips - Peteraposs other daughter - seemingly standing proudly beside Philip.Itaposs thought the picture must have been taken before  as some of the younger great-grandchildren donapost feature.

Dedicated servants, many who were forced to spend substantial amounts of time away from their loved ones over the pandemic after entering protective bubbles at Windsor Castle and Balmoral to protect the monarch, said there was “palpable anger” at the revelations over illegal lockdown parties in government.The Queen was evacuated from Buckingham Palace at the start of the pandemic and formed a support bubble with her beloved late husband Prince Philip who moved from his home at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk.Other royal staff said “sacrices made from the very top all the way down” to keep people safe were being rendered “worthless”. One servant with more than  years service within the household said some colleagues had become “visibly upset” when discussing how the Queen was forced to sit alone at her beloved late husband’s funeral in April due to coronavirus restrictions.Her Majesty, like thousands of others across the nation as the pandemic raged on, complied with covid restrictions leaving them to alter plans for funerals or tragically being unable to say goodbye to their loved ones as they lay dying in hospital. Staff who cared for the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh throughout the pandemic told how they had made “huge sacrices” to maintain strict covid bubbles in the belief they were “doing out bit” to keep the monarch safe from the deadly virus. One said: “It would be a gross understatement to say people are angry. “Many missed Christmas, birthdays, other special occasions and weeks on end away from their families. “But it was all in the spirit it was for the greater good and we were doing our bit. “It’s a slap in the face for anyone frankly.”  The Queen was last year forced to spend a final Christmas alone with Prince Philip at Windsor Castle, before he passed away aged  in April. The image of the -year-old dressed in black with a black mask covering nearly her entire face while sitting alone in St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle will be forever etched in the nation’s memory. Labour leader Sir Keir on Wednesday highlighted the head of state’s leadership and the sacrices she made at the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral during the Covid- crisis at Prime Minister’s Questions.He was speaking as Boris Johnson faced the furore over claims Downing Street staff broke lockdown rules by holding a Christmas party last year.Sir Keir told the Commons: “Her Majesty the Queen sat alone when she marked the passing of the man she’d been married to for  years. “Leadership, sacrice - that’s what gives leaders the moral authority to lead. “Does the Prime Minister think he has the moral authority to lead and to ask the British people to stick to the rules ” The Queen was due to have her weekly audience with the Prime Minister on Wednesday, either by person or by phone. Buckingham Palace did not comment. Her Majesty has been resting on doctors’ orders and only carrying out light duties such as audiences since spending a night in hospital for preliminary tests on October , and later spraining her back. She is also preparing to film her Christmas Day message to the nation. The Queen is likely to use her annual pre-recorded televised speech, which she writes herself, to reflect on the ongoing challenges facing the country, as well as touching on her own personal grief with the loss of Philip in April. The royal family is hoping to gather to celebrate Christmas with the monarch at her Sandringham estate in Norfolk after last year’s festivities were curtailed due to the pandemic.

Tamekia Thompson, , says she is desperate to move from her south London home. The mum-of-two claims rodents eat her food, and the floors and cupboards are strewn with thousands of droppings.Tamekia, a private tenant who moved into the property in  with her two young children, said the house became infested with mice two years ago, MyLondon reports. She said her seven-year-old daughter is incredibly stressed and she is terried her four-year-old autistic son who will eat anything will ingest the droppings and get sick. Tamekiaaposs landlord claims he has put in measures to address the infestation.  Christian Mantey told MyLondon he has a contract with a pest control company, who have laid traps in the house and have agreed to visit every two weeks to dispose of dead mice and fill in holes. He added that the process is taking longer than usual because pest control cannot put poison down over safety concerns with Tamekiaaposs son. He also explained that the tenant is aware of this. Mr Mantey said he has now issued a Section  eviction notice to Tamekia, who has not paid her rent for around seven months. He said: Iaposve given [Tamekia] her Section  notice telling her to leave because sheaposs in arrears of £,. In terms of the rodent issue in the house, thereaposs been pest control that has come to the property, I think about a month ago while she was there. They set up all the traps and all the other equipment they needed in front of her. She said they canapost put certain traps around because of the kids, so they adjusted the traps according to how she wanted it. They come every two weeks, Iaposve got a contract with them that they will come every two or three weeks to pick up the dead mice or whatever they find, and to fill up the holes. He added: Iaposm doing what Iaposve got to do, the pest control is doing what theyaposve got to do, you canapost eradicate these things straight away. Tamekia claims she is withholding the rent due to problems with the house, including the rodent infestation.She said that she left her job in August to care for her son full time and is now dependent on Universal Credit from Croydon Council to pay her rent, which she says she hasnapost paid due to the mouse infestation.Tamekia says she was told by a pest control worker that, because of the severity of the infection, it would be tricky to get rid of them. Tamekia also said the house also has severe issues with damp on one of the walls. However, Mr Mantey claims Tamekia has never told him that her failure to pay rent is due to her problems with the house, or the mouse infestation. Mr Mantey also claims he has had someone fix the damp in the house two years ago and Tamekia didnapost complain again until two weeks ago. He said he has recently been contacted by Croydon Council about the house, who he said have given him  days to get aposspecicapos jobs done in the house, including fixing the damp and repairing the windows. He said: There are people coming to do the whole property. Iaposm sorting it. Speaking about the mouse infestation, he added: Getting rid of any infestation takes whatever itaposs going to take. Tamekia, who is currently on a housing waiting list with Croydon Council, moved into the house to support her sister, who had access to the property under the Shared Lives scheme through the council. The former care worker said: My kids are scared, screaming, crying, they donapost want to sleep in the room. My daughter said to me aposmummy Iaposm stressedapos... and it really broke my heart. I can tell sheaposs frustrated. She said: [My son] will eat anything, you have to be watching him. Tamekia said her family gets sick a lot: My kids they are vomiting and stuff like that... every minute we are catching colds... itaposs just hard work for me to be cleaning [mouse] poo every day... The council confirmed Tamekia is on a housing waiting list but have advised her to seek alternative accommodation due to a housing shortage. Steve Reed, MP for Croydon North, also raised the issue with the council in September, but contacted Tamekia on November  to say he was yet to receive a response. A Croydon Council spokesperson told MyLondon that they have advised Tamekia on her current private arrangement with her landlord. They say they have advised her to seek alternative accommodation through the private rented or social housing sector, as there is a housing shortage. A council spokesperson said: “Although this is not a council property, we have provided Ms Thompson with advice and support around her housing options in both the private rented sector and social housing. We have also been in contact with her landlord about repairs to his property.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Steve ReedSingle mumAutismHousing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Many people were left without electricity after the storms cut cables during gales which were close to mph on Monday. Barraaposs effects are still being felt, with roads closed due to flooding in places such as Greater Manchester. While temperatures have been milder - they are now predicted to drop in the days ahead.  Weather maps from WXCharts suggest suggest snow could fall across northern Scotland on Thursday night and possibly into Friday morning.

The Met Office said there is a chance of rain and snow in high areas of the UK next week. Its long term forecast said: To begin the period, drier and clearer conditions are likely, allowing for more extensive frost and patchy fog.  Cloud and strong winds will travel east across the country, with a chance of showers or longer spells of rain for many. Hill snow likely in the north. Temperatures generally around average. Moving through the period, largely unsettled conditions are likely to persist, with the chance of further showers and longer spells of rain, heavy in places, with a chance of gales. Some showers are likely to turn wintry on hills at times. Towards the end of the period, more settled conditions are likely to develop, most likely with milder temperatures, but a chance of some brief colder interludes.The BBC long-range weather forecast says Scotland and Northern Ireland “may continue to be impacted by Atlantic weather systems” during this period.The forecast says the conditions is being driven by an area of high pressure over Europe and low pressure from Iceland.Minimum temperature charts predict lows of C in the North, C in the South and C in Scotland overnight on December , the Express reported.But the latest windchill prediction from WXCharts suggests it will feel like C to-C. UK forecast for the next  days Today: Showers easing away northeastwards with many parts fine for a time, particularly the east. Rain ing to western parts by lunchtime then gradually moving eastwards. Becoming milder in southwest. Tonight: Band of rain clearing eastwards followed by scattered blustery showers. These most frequent in north and west with a risk of hail and thunder. Friday: Sunny spells and scattered showers, though some eastern areas probably staying dry.

Then when it snowed the neighbour, who is in his s, turned to the man for help and asked him to clear his drive - but the man said he wouldnapost do it unless he was paid. The neighbour refused so the man didnapost help, but now his we is saying he was in the wrong and should have done the work as the man was old and needed help. What would you have done in that scenario  Let us know in the comments...Taking to Reddit, the man said: This summer, he told us that my relationship with him was no longer friendly, and we were to be strictly neighbours for the rest of the time that we lived together. Last night we got our first big snow of the season. Instead of snow blowing his driveway like I usually do, I snow blowed mine and went back inside.  minutes later, he texted me saying that he was going to breakfast with his friend and needed his driveway snow blowed so he could get out.  I responded that I would no longer be doing his driveway for free since he had said that our relationship was no longer friendly. I offered to do his driveway for £ , or I said he could pay one of the kids that live in the neighbourhood. He got pissed and told me that he didn’t have time to coordinate with the neighbourhood kids and that he needed his driveway snow blowed. I told him I would do it for £. He said he refused to pay me to do his driveway. So I told him I wouldn’t do it. It’s later in the day now and he hasn’t cleared his driveway yet. I feel great, but he called me an a*****e in his texts and my we told me I might be an a*****e because he’s old.

Tell your neighbour youaposll do it for  or fty bucks and being told youaposre the most handsome boy in the world. While a third added: If he wants neighbourly kindness, he has to be a kind neighbour. He made it very clear he wasnapost interested in that kind of friendly relationship, so you donapost owe him more than he asked for, which was strictly neighbours.

The mum told her mother-in-law that C would not be getting her ears pierced until sheaposs old enough to ask to have them done herself, and in response, was told that sheaposs a hypocrite considering she has several piercings herself. My own mother wouldn’t let me even get my earlobes pierced until I was , but my mother-in-law had both had both my sister-in-lawsapos ears pierced when they were tiny, and she keeps going on about how aposit’s better because they won’t remember itapos, the mum wrote on Redditaposs AITA forum.J says he supports whatever decision I make on the matter because I’m the one who would have to clean it, as I stay home with C while he works full time. The mum thought the issue had been put to bed, until a few weeks ago, when her mother-in-law was taking care of C for them as they were going to a funeral. As I was coming down the stairs I hear my mother-in-law talking to C about how aposthey’re going to go out shopping and get her some pretty earrings.apos I went into the room and told her in no uncertain terms that that would not be happening, andI can’t trust her to respect my decisions about my own daughter I would find someone  to look after her, she continued, adding that she ended up getting her sister to babysit.

Now my mother-in-law keeps trying to arrange to have her for a few hours, she even tried to offer to have her overnight so J and I can go out, but I refused. I told her she could come and visit her, but I no longer trusted her not to get her ears pierced behind my back, so she would be seeing her unsupervised. The mum said that both her husband and her sister-in-law think sheaposs overreacting, prompting her to turn to Reddit to question whether others thought her reaction was justied. She definitely intends to get her ears pierced. Iaposm of the opinion that itaposs unfair to put a baby through unnecessary pain, as they canapost understand it. Vaccines serve a purpose and are justied, but earrings donapost. Your daughter will grow up just fine without them and can ask for them when sheaposs ready, one Reddit user commented. The bigger concern is your mother-in-law not respecting your authority as the mother. Please donapost allow her unsupervised visits with your daughter as she doesnapost seem trustworthy. Another agreed: Of course her children think youaposre overreacting they were raised by this human bulldozer and donapost know any better. Their opinions on boundaries canapost be trusted. Also, the idea that your husband defers to you because you would be solely responsible for the care and cleaning just because you stay home  Like... is he incapable of holding a Q-tip between the hours of  and pm  She is his daughter, too, and he absolutely has a vested interest in whether his mother goes behind both of your backs to do this.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Image: GettyopinionByPatrick Reid:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec | commentsWhen I was a rookie futures trader, the owner of my company hired a luxury hotel in Barcelona for our Christmas bash. We had an incredible year trading, and so as a treat he paid for  of us to go on holiday for a knees up.But before we left he issued us with one stern condition: we would not upset the locals and get too drunk. Famous last words.It started quite civilised as we managed to see a football game at Camp Nou and I got to see the beautul city and architecture. I even popped into the Picasso museum for a couple of hours. That is about as good as it got for being well behaved and sticking by the rules set by the boss. During the evening things went downhill - and fast. The club led onto a beach, and after the third tequila a few of the female traders decided to steal my clothes and wear them. Running around trying to look for them was useless, so I just had to borrow a coat from a mate.  The DJ weaposd hired threw a real tantrum and left because he was fed up with our “music requests. What he didnapost know is we all had a bet to see how many times he could play Princeaposs Kiss . Around am the ambulance got called to help an older trader who we thought was having a heart attack. Thankfully it was just really bad heartburn but we were all really worried for him at the time. What got me was he actually came back to the bar for another drink afterwards! What a legend fool - delete as you see fit. The last thing I remember is wearing a trilby hat trying to look cool and failing while chatting up the receptionist - then seeing two couples having sex on the beach, in full view of everyone.  When the bill came we insisted on paying for the clean-up which apparently was nearly as much as the drinks weaposd guzzled. The fallout didnapost come until two months later, but it was a great bonding exercise and I’ll never forget it. I never thought you could have a hangover that lasted a whole week. Turns out you can, but I do not recommend it. Now my le is far more relaxed and I’ll remember those days with affection.... and embarrassment.*Patrick Reid is the co-founder of Adamis Principle and an FX traderRead MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Heart attackChristmas party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Shannon Richardson, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, says her -month-old son Freddie had been inexplicably waking up every night around am and refusing to go back to sleep, leaving her and partner Jack Gray perplexed. However, the couple were horried to discover the aposexplanationapos - when they heard a aposdeep male voiceapos talking to little Freddie through the camera, which was so clear they thought someone was in the house at first. Racing into their sonaposs room, Jack ripped the aposhackedapos monitor out of the wall from where it had been positioned to film their youngster - before throwing it into a skip. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Shannon, , was left so scared that it could be a aposlocal manapos that she insisted on staying at her mumaposs house even after it had been thrown away and once home had Freddie stay in bed with her. Now the care assistant fears that the man could have been watching their son for weeks and even seeing the couple trying to calm him, with images on the monitor showing Jack climbing into the cot to try to sooth his son. Shannon said: The sickness, upset and disgust we feel is awful. How long has this creep been watching Freddieaposs room  We get him changed after bath times and put him to bed in there. We donapost know how long this has been going on for because, for a while, heaposd been waking up at the same time in the night at around am and we werenapost able to settle him. Jack was getting in the cot to try and comfort him. Weaposd been trying to settle him and nothing would work so we think someone was waking him up. But now weaposve removed the baby monitor, he hasnapost been waking up in the night. Images caught on the monitor show Jack, who works in fire and flood restoration, comforting his son in the cot in the middle of the night in the weeks leading up to the incident in October, to no avail. Shannon said: It was around .am and me and Jack were watching TV. We had the camera on and we heart rustling so we watched it for a minute thinking it was probably Freddie moving around in his cot. All of a sudden, we heard this really deep, male voice and it was so clear, we thought he was in the bedroom. He was saying aposbabyapos and aposbabaapos like he was trying to wake Freddie up. Jack ran upstairs and barged into Freddieaposs room. No one was in there but the monitor moved towards Jackaposs direction. The voice had come through the monitor. Jack just ripped the monitor out of the wall and picked Freddie up. We went into our bedroom and just sat there not knowing what to do. We were in shock. I didnapost know what to believe or to think. Shannon says the manaposs voice had been so clear that they thought someone was in the house and that the incident has left her feeling scared in her own home. Shannon said: Jack threw the monitor in a skip. I didnapost want to be in my house, I kept going to my mumaposs even though the monitor was gone. I didnapost feel comfortable and I was on edge. I was scared because we didnapost knowit was a local man. I wasnapost comfortable putting Freddie to bed on his own so he was sleeping in my bed with me but I had to eventually put him in his own bed so he didnapost get too used to being with me. Shannon had been given the video baby monitor as a gt while she was pregnant and had been using it ever since Freddie was born, Shannon said: I thought it was really handy because when he was in bed, it was nice to be able to see him. Weaposve been using it since he was born. Baby monitors are supposed to be a safe thing to watch your baby. You would never think that someone  would be watching them through it.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

British socialite Maxwell is accused of preying on vulnerable young girls and luring them to massage rooms to be molested by Epstein between  and . Images shown to a New York court during her trial show Epstein and Maxwell embracing one another, riding a motorbike and flying on private jets. One also shows an advert created in which massage therapists were asked to apply to Epsteinaposs Palm Beach home at weekend. Maxwellaposs criminal trial entered its eighth day on Wednesday, after jurors heard testimony from three women who said they were teenagers when she set them up for sexual abuse by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein.  Prosecutors are expected to call one more alleged victim to take the stand, and may wrap up their case as soon as Thursday, about two weeks faster than they had originally forecast. The defence would then have a chance to present a case. It is unclear whether Maxwell would testy, given the prospect she could face a y cross-examination by prosecutors.

In more than four hours of often tearful testimony on Tuesday, Carolyn recalled telling Maxwell about her troubled childhood, including that her mother was an alcoholic and that she was molested by her grandfather at age . She also said she was nude and preparing to massage Epstein, when Maxwell once fondled her. What she did was wrong, Carolyn said. Maxwellaposs lawyers have argued that Carolyn, Jane and a third woman who testied for the government, Kate, had incentives to implicate Maxwell because they received seven-figure settlements from a compensation fund for Epsteinaposs victims. Kate was described as a victim in the  indictment against Maxwell, but U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan ruled that her encounters with Epstein were not illegal because she was old enough to consent.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Private jetsCrimeTeenagersAlcoholismGhislaine Maxwell\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He is now under criminal investigation for rape, attempted murder and the kidnapping of two other women, aged  and , who were tied up with duct tape in the apartment from which victim had jumped.  The suspect was shown at a crime reenactment at the spot where the woman fell telling investigators: I stabbed her twice. With a kne. This way. Then I ran away.” He demonstrates on a mannequin how he allegedly attacked the woman. The Russian Investigative Committee said Aminov - whose job was renovating flats - “used violence against [the woman] and beat her up, after which he raped her.  “The victim, fleeing from the accused, jumped from the height of the fourth floor. “The man, with intent to kill her looked for a sharp object, went downstairs and inflicted multiple wounds on her, after which he fled.” The -year-old woman is in a “serious” condition in hospital with a fractured pelvis and stab wounds.

A mobile office and chemical toilet would also be onsite for that duration.It would require a -square-metre area in the north of the former power station site to be fenced off for the duration.Plans are with East Lothian Council and can be viewed on the planing portal."},{"url":null,"title":"snack-van-shore-road-car-park-john-muir-way-dunbar-approved","story":"The plans for the van at the Shore Road car park, on the John Muir Way at Belhaven, drew  protests and were described by one elected councillor as ldquosacrilege.Local residents pleaded with East Lothian Councilrsquos planning committee to refuse planning permission, arguing it went against everything naturalist John Muir, who was born in Dunbar, stood for and strived to achieve.Other residents pointed to road safety concerns on the streets surrounding the car park, which at one point last year saw , vehicles a day visiting it.Local residents said that their streets were already jammed by the overspill of the car park, which sits near a popular surf school which operates from the bay, adding that the snack van would only attract more visitors.One man said thathe left his home to go grocery shopping at the weekend, he wouldto find he could not park within half a mile of his home, adding: ldquoIf that is not impacting on my amenity, I donrsquot know what is.However, Councillor Norman Hampshire, local ward councillor, council leader and planning convenor, insisted that the snack van ndash which will be powered by batteries rather than a generator and use compostable cutlery ndash would be a welcome addition for people who visited the beach and walked the John Muir Way.He told protesters: ldquoA lot of people are not fortunate to be able to buy a house close to the beach and they would enjoy the opportunity to walk down there and enjoy a cup of coffee.Fellow ward councillor Sue Kempson called in the application for the van to the committee after planning officers recommended it for approval.At a previous bid to put a snack van on the site two years ago, which was thrown out,Dr Kempson described visitors to the van as having their ldquogrotty coffee, adding:ldquoIrsquom sorry but I have used snack bars and never had decent coffee [from them].Dr Kempson told the committee that she was concerned about the impact of the new snack van, which was being sited at a dferent point of the car park, further away from housing, on thegrass area it was designated.She supported residents concerns about the snack van being on the John Muir Way.She said: ldquoTo give permission for this van on the John Muir site, Dunbar, is to me sacrilege.Jacquie Bell, from Dunbar Community Council, which also objected to the snack van, pointed out that the Shore Road car park was ldquoan anomaly among coastal car parks in East Lothian because it was next to residential streets.She said: ldquoThis is not a NIMBY objection, the priority concern is road safety.And she criticised the council for advertising the site as a potential snack van placement, saying the financial gain for the local authorityof tendering the site was ldquooutweighedby the impact of the van.Bethan and Markos Akgum, who applied for permission to operate the snackvan at the site, said that they had switched to electric batteries and reduced the size of the van, as well as changing its colour, after feedback from the community.Bethan told the committee that plans were in place to monitor litter by using branded compostable containers, which she suggested could be marked with the initials of customers to make them more responsible for disposing of them properly.The efforts of the applicants were welcomed by many councillors on the committee.Mr Hampshire said that he had lived in Dunbar all his le and had fond memories of visiting the bay while growing up and with his family, and the provision of a snack van would be appreciated.He said: ldquoEvery time I am down at Belhaven, someone will come and ask me lsquowhere can I buy a coffee rsquo and there is nowhere, only a long, long walk to buy a cup of coffee.ldquoThe van will be adjacent to the John Muir Way and hundreds of walkers will welcome it. I think it will be an asset to people who use the bay.The committee voted by  votes to one to approve the snack van.

been carried out ndash leaving the roads and pedestrian networks around the area at breaking point.Dunbar community councillor Jacquie Bell told the planning committee at its online meeting on Tuesday: ldquoThis proposal has infrastructure holes like Swiss cheese, questions that need resolving and time constraints when we need time to review.The committee was asked to approve Taylor Wimpey

continuation of a decision on the planning application until more answers could be sought.Councillor Findlay moved a motion for a delay to the decision, citing a need to update the contributions being requested for the East Coast Main Line crossing but was defeated by eight votes to three.The committee then approved the plans by  votes to one with only Councillor Findlay against.A further

The UK Government and devolved governments are expecting charities to fill the gap and are failing to do their moral duty to all their constituents and look after the deprived.There is something far wrong when millionaires have had substantial increases in their finances during this pandemic when so many have suffered. Since the end of the Second World War, company senior management and directors have increased their income by incredible percentages and have more money than any fair-minded person would agree was acceptable. Many of these people own more property and other goods than they can ever use.Privatisation of public utilities has led to poor services but large profits for shareholders. Scottish Water is one utility still in public hands and is endeavouring to bring facilities up to standard and is still keeping bills at a reasonable level. Other utilities have been split up into small sections with each one expected to show a profit, thus to leading bigger bills for the public.We must have changes so that everyone is looked after as happens in the Scandinavian countries, where the gap between the haves and have-nots is limited and the majority of the electorate are contented with their lot.Ian Turner, Bearsden.LACK OF FORESIGHT ON GAS BOILERSI WAS surprised that the Scottish Government has decreed that no new gas boilers will be supplied and fitted after , which is just over four years away. The problem is that more than a third of the population of Scotland are at present unable to afford the current energy bills, let alone the alternatives, which have to be supplied and fitted at the householders expense.Admittedly a small and totally inadequate grant is available for the heat exchanger types, but these are untried and untested on any scale in this country. There are also drawbacks, such as the current radiators in houses here being unsuitable.The green lobby does not seem to care about what happens to people as long as their policies are fulfilled. However, I thought that the Scottish Government would have adopted a more responsible attitude to the matter of our people being able to keep their houses warm in winter. After all, this lack of foresight could well result in a great many premature deaths, especially among the elderly.James Evans, Dumbarton.ANDREW MARRS WINING FORMULAI AM at odds with Neil Stewarton his criticism of Andrew Marrs interviewing style.He alleges that Marrs constant interruptions preclude guests from giving the response he is seeking. I am sure that I am not alone in thinking that politicians in particular have a knack of re-orienteering the question to one that they wish to answer or taking the opportunity to dwell on some other aspect of their endeavours rather than the matter being discussed. The Governments successful roll-out of the vaccine programme is continually employed to detract from other major failings.Andrew Marrs success is that he does have the ability to get members of the Government on his show whereas Newsnight is constantly apologising for the failure of ministers to make themselves available.David G Will, Milngavie."},{"url":null,"title":"new-project-improve-salmon-farm-welfare-sustainability","story":"The scheme, run by The Scottish Salmon Companyat its Applecross sites, will also see the creation of  new jobs in the northwest Highlands.The four-year aquaculture research and development project aims to increase the size of smoltsin an ecologically sustainable way using innovative new technology.If successful, it is hoped that the research will ldquosignicantly advance salmon farming in Scotland.Highlands and Islands Enterprisehas approved up to poundm of investment, with a further poundm confirmed by Marine Scotland.Announcing the funding, Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon said:ldquoThis investment underlines our commitment to promoting sustainable development for the aquaculture sector.ldquoI welcome the new approach being taken by The Scottish Salmon Company since it became part of the Bakkafrost Group and the introduction of new management.ldquoThe project will deliver on improved fish and welfare, applies innovation to address key challenges and contributes towards sustainability.

The investors claim that ldquorenewables and networks are intrinsically dferent businesses with inidual funding needs, growth profiles and strategic priorities. The article goes on to say the combination of renewables and network assets is depriving shareholders of pound billion value because they do not belong together.I find this cynical prioritising of shareholder value over the engineering and ultimately the consumer interests in efficiency, security and cost control deeply upsetting. The strategic priority is to recognise that the integration of generation and network is a real-time absolute and demands engineering discipline. Anything which intervenes to confound this fact can only lead to increased risk and costs to the consumer.This highlights all the problems of establishing a viable secure and efficient public electricity supply when it is being controlled by bankers rather than engineers.The establishment of a National Energy Authority is an urgent priority.Norman McNab, Killearn.NO MORAL SUPERIORITYBOB Ballantynecannot be allowed to get away with his claim that,the father of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and his partner ldquohad been religious, they ldquocould not possibly have carried out the boyrsquos ill treatment and murder. He should try telling that to the many victims of physical and sexual child abuse when in the care of schools or other institutions run by religious orders.The truth is that those who choose to belong to a religion are no better than those of us who do not. Clearly people have every right to choose to believe in a god, or gods, and to try to live their own lives under the rules of their chosen religion. But they have no credibilitythey try to imply, as Mr Ballantyne does, that they are somehow better people than those of us who live in a more rational world.

And I dont think its too grandiose, you know, to turn to and look for inspiration in the words of people like Martin Luther King who said there comes a time when when its our obligation to break immoral laws.\"Speculation has been re that the government had decided to implement a so-called Plan B of further restrictions, including requiring vaccine passports for large venues and an order to work from home.There were  confirmed Omicron cases in the UK on Tuesday and Downing Street has said there are early signs that the new ian is more transmissible, although much remains unknown. And Nicola Sturgeon, who extended Scotlands work-from-home guidance until mid-January, has warned of a rapid rise in Omicron cases.She said it is vital to \"strengthen compliance\" with existing measures to slow the spread of Omicron.The first minister says she \"cannot guarantee\" further measures will not be needed.The Omicron iant has been reported in  nations and the number of patients needing hospitalisation is likely to rise as it spreads, the World Health Organization has said.The WHO, in its weekly epidemiological report, said more data was needed to assess the severity of disease caused by the Omicron iant and whether its mutations might reduce protection from vaccine-derived immunity.Mr Oliver, whose weekly monologues often go viral on social media said past restrictions including the lockdowns have done as yet \"uncalculated, unmeasured harm to peoples physical and mental health, to the economy, to the education of children\".The former National Trust for Scotland president who faced calls for him to be cancelled after stating he would \"cheerfully risk catching Covid\" in the name of personal freedom added before Boris Johnsons latest announcement: \"And to continue to do that is reprehensible and furthermore, its immoral and you cannot justy submitting to and following the guidelines and restrictions that you know, are morally wrong just because theyve been handed down from on high.\"There comes a time when its beholden upon any of us and all of us to say, Thats immoral, and thats wrong. And just because you as the government are telling me to do it, I will not do it because its immoral and its wrong. That is the right thing to do.\"The archaeologist and author turned TV presenters commentary sparked some debate on social media with his latest comments said he gets s of pieces of mail and he has drawn the conclusion there are millions of people who are opposed to what is going on.He said that he hears from people all the time who say that theyre on the point of losing their jobs because of whether or not they want to take a vaccine.And he said while collective action is needed to stand up against restrictions, he understoodpeople felt they could not put their jobs at risk.The Renfrewshire-born -year-old GB News host who has previously stated that he and his we will not let their three teenage children take the Covid vaccine said: \"I completely understand, empathise and sympathise with people whose first priority is and has to be putting food on the table, making sure that they have an income so that they can look after themselves and look after families,\" he said.\"I hear all the time that people agree with what we are saying, but are frightened to speak.\"Now where someone  in your work, in your shop in your factory, whatever, speaks up, thenmore people stand shoulder to shoulder with them, it doesnt always take everyone to turn the tide.\"One person on the road can be singled out. One stick is easily snapped but a bundle of sticks is unbreakable. And where you see someone being singled out, but you share their opinion, take the step join up with them, stand by them, speak up and say what they are saying.\"It does take courage but we are in that situation now where each of us has to take inidual responsibility. If there ever was a time for waiting for someone , other people, to fix the situation, while you keep your head down,there ever was a time like that that time has passed.\"It has to be proportionate, but people have to take the opportunities, the proportionate opportunities that they can see to support one another.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13279670.jpg?type=article-full","title":"gleneagles-chef-liam-rogers-cusp-masterchef-professionals-final","story":"Gleneagles sous chefLiam Rogersentered the professional MasterChef kitchen last month and has done nothing short of stunning elite judges Gregg Wallace, Monica Galetti and Marcus Wareing with his home inspired classical dishes.On his journey he has impressed at nearly every turn and is looking to continue his fine run of form to reach the finals and maybe even win the  Professional MasterChef title.When he started, Liam only had the ambition of reaching the semi-final and any further would just be an added bonus.Well, on Tuesday evening his talents, and a delightful looking poached lobster tail dish, ensured his progression into the second and final stage of the semis which will air Thursday at pm.However, now that he has surpassed his expectations, Liam wants to keep the momentum going and aim even higher. After four weeks only the best remain in the competition and speaking to The Herald, the young chef said it would be lsquoindescribablersquo to win the elite title.He said: ldquoAt the beginning, I set myself a goal in my head that I wanted to get to the semi-finals, but now that I am here, I just want more.ldquoI always want more, and I want to progress through to finals week.ldquoWinning this competition would mean the world to me obviously, and it would make all the late nights, missed weddings, and hard work worth it.ldquoIt would be indescribable, especially with how intense the process has been, but wersquoll have to wait and see.:Young Scots chef Jonathan Ferguson battles it out in Roux Scholarship competition pm on BBC One and catch up on iPlayer\" alt\"HeraldScotland: MasterChef: The Professionals Semi Finals continue tonightpm on BBC One and catch up on iPlayer\" class\"editor-image\"MasterChef: The Professionals Semi Finals continue tonightpm on BBC One and catch up on iPlayerOriginally from Stockton Heath, Liam came to Scotland to work at two Michelin star Restaurant Andrew Fairlie in .

It was the perfect place to properly start my career.To work in a business and kitchen which is run in the way that it is was incredible, and it is something that will always stay with me.ldquoChef Andrewrsquos style was very classically based and being trained that way myself and going straight to work for him in a two Michelin star establishment, he has had a big influence on my cooking.ldquoMy favourite Scottish dish is Langoustines, and my uncle and I would always go to a pub on the west coast of Scotland and order a big platter of them with mayonnaise and skinny fries.The younger chefrsquos journey over the last four weeks has caught the eyes of Britainrsquos viewers, and his appearance on the BBC programme has undoubtedly demonstrated his ability to cook at the highest level.However, Liam is known for his focus in the MasterChef Kitchen and rarely cracks a smile due to his concentration, but he did assure viewers that he was having fun despite the serious persona he gives off on screen.:Glasgows Michelin star chef Lorna McNee earns talent of the year awardNow that the final stage of the competition is close to an end, regardless of any result, the experience has opened doors.

The Scottish Government via Transport Scotland have funded around half the £. million costs.The council’s head of marine services, transportation and harbour master, Jim Buck, is confident that the new m modern fibre glass vessel will have been worth the wait.“We are delighted to be able to announce the start date for the Nordic Sea. The Golden Mariana has served the communities well, but it’s time now for a younger, more comfortable vessel to take over. At m, with a m beam, the Nordic Sea will be able to carry  passengers and is capable of running at between - knots, which is a little faster than the Golden Mariana. She has stabilisers installed to help with the motion and is a much more luxurious vessel for passengers and, very importantly, is fully accessible for those who require this.”The ship has attracted plenty of speculation, after long periods of being tied up since being purchased in April . COVID delayed a £, refit programme, and further complicating matters has been the retirement of the previous skipper of the Golden Mariana and the longer-than-anticipated recruitment process for crew to serve on the Nordic Sea.Mr Buck went on to explain why the process has taken longer than some had expected.“It would appear to have taken a long time but actually in respect of the certication process when taking a vessel from one country to another it has actually been remarkably quick. She is the first vessel of her type to go through that process and with that comes inevitable hurdles that need to be overcome. The Nordic Sea had a series of modications made to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication standard.“She was built to a dferent specication so had to go through the required checks and balances to ensure we met the current specications for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s current passenger vessel system.”He is confident that she will be a favourable addition to the fleet.“She is a really good sea keeping vessel with good properties designed with the right centre of height for that comfortable ride.”Councillor David Dawson, chair of the board of Orkney Ferries, said: “I would like to recognise the efforts of the team here in Orkney for getting us to this stage, particularly given the challenges added in by the pandemic, but also for the patience of the people of Papay. We must not forget the faithful service of the Golden Mariana and crew who have served the communities well.“From the information I have received from seagoing staff who have taken the Nordic Sea out in what could be described as ‘challenging conditions’, I have every confidence that the Papay community will not be disappointed in what is a first-class vessel.“We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland to enable the purchase of the vessel and are looking forward to the inaugural journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In an update to the Scottish Parliament this Tuesday afternoon, she explained that the nation#s coronavirus restrictions are to be reviewed on a daily basis in the wake of an increasing number of Omicron cases.She has urged everyone across Scotland to stick closely to the guidelines. This included strict guidance to employers with staff who can fulfil their duties from home and testing before mixing with people from other houses.These changes come as Orkney recorded seven cases over the past  hours, according to the daily figures published by the Scottish Government. This has brought the county#s total to .On the new restrictions, the First Minister said: “To be blunt,you had staff working from home at the start of the pandemic, please now enable them to do so again.##I#m asking you to do this from now, until the middle of January, when we will review this advice again.#She also said: #Test and Protect is deploying enhanced contact tracing for all cases with the s-gene drop-out that is indicative of Omicron. For these cases, household contacts of close contacts, rather than just the close contacts themselves are being asked to test and isolate.#For non-Omicron cases,you have COVID symptoms you are being urged to book a PCR test and self-isolate until you receive the result. If the result is negative, you can end isolationyou are double vaccinatedit is positive, you must isolate for the full ten days.Ms Sturgeon has also asked everyone to test #regularly and repeatedly# with lateral flow device test.#We are asking everyone to do a lateral flow test before mixing with people from other households — and on every occasion you intend doing so. That means before going to a pub, a restaurant, visiting anybody #s house, or even going shopping.#Concluding, the First Minister said: #If we do all of these things, dficult though I appreciate they are, even with a more transmissible iant, I do really hope we can avoid the need for any further measures.

Although folk must still enter via the south nave side door, once inside the cathedral, everyone will be able to enjoy the new glazed timber vestibule.Meredith Macbeth, St Magnus Cathedral#s historical buildings conservator, said: “We are absolutely delighted with the work so far and the new vestibule truly enhances the entryway of this wonderful building. The works are not entirely complete as the curved glass has been delayed by the supplier in Europe due to COVID, Brexit and other supply issues, but we are expecting it early . So for now the area will remain roped off from the public, but it is a delight to see the new vestibule settling in and the excited response by those who know the building so well.”Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC#s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “The cathedral really is the gt that keeps on giving to the people of Orkney and further afield.#What a beautul addition to what is a very special building. I look forward to seeing the complete, finished product which is sure to be absolutely stunning.”Elaine Grieve from the Society of the Friends of St Magnus Cathedral, who are making a substantial contribution to the costs of the work, said: “The Cathedral is so precious that it is hard to contemplate making any changes for fear they won’t do the building justice.#However, in this case, what an absolutely wonderful transformation the vestibule has made to the entrance of the building. The craftmanship is outstanding and we now have an addition which befits this treasured building loved by so many near and far.”The cathedral#s stonework also enjoyed a facelt recently.Conservation works included repointing stonework with lime mortar on the interior and exterior of the west door. Samples of original lime mortars were found deep in the constructions joints of the building and were analysed by the Scottish Lime Centre in Fe. An appropriate mix was specied, to match in manner of strength, colour and aggregate size.For anyone wishing to visit there are signs directly through the side gate, please be mindful of the restrictions in place in regards to the pandemic such as the wearing of masks and social distancing while inside.St Magnus Cathedral is managed by OIC on behalf of the people of Orkney.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4300089.jpg--.jpg?1638952026000\n","title":"barbers collect christmas gifts","story":"BALLYMENA barbers have called on the local community to donate a Christmas gt to local young people leaving care.The Barbers Collective, in partnership with VOYPIC-Voice of Young People in Care- are calling on customers, shoppers, and local residents to pick up an extra gt, to donate to a young care leaver this Christmas.

The organisation runs ious groups and forums from its office on Garfield Place, as well as supporting inidual young people through coaching and an independent advocacy service.Iain Black, Northern Area Manager at VOYPIC, said, “Christmas is a happy time for most, but for some young people it can be tough. Young care leavers often feel isolated, and Christmas can be a particularly dficult time.“We know that young men leaving care can face a whole range of additional challenges, so we hope that by partnering with The Barber Collective we can start a conversation on how we can help them feel more connected and valued across our community.”Chris Power, from The Barber Collective, explained why the business has decided to support young care leavers.He said: “We realise that we are fortunate enough to be in the position to give and receive gts. Not everyone is as fortunate, but everybody should have a present on Christmas morning.”Gts should be suitable for young people, aged - years old. Presents for young men are particularly need this Christmas. Popular gts include hats, scarves and gloves, home essentials, toiletries, and sweet treats. Gt vouchers, including phone top-ups, utilities vouchers, and supermarket gt cards, are particularly welcomed by young people.Alternatively customers of the Barber Collective can ‘pay it forward’ by gting a voucher for a free haircut to a young man with experience of care.Stuart Forsythe, a care experienced Young Leader in VOYPIC, welcomed the initiative stating: “Sometimes, getting your hair cut can drop down the list of priorities, especially when money is tight. But, sitting in the chair, it gives you time to stop and take a breath, to have a chat with the barber, and to take some time for yourself.”“And, getting your hair cut- it just makes you feel better,” he added.Gts can be left under the tree at the The Barber Collective, Church Street, during working hours until Saturday  December.For more information about VOYPIC, visit www.voypic.org or search VOYPIC across social media.

The firm is now being examined as part of an inquiry into how Grenfell Tower came to be coated in flammable materials which contributed to the spread of flames.However, Kingspan said it “played no role in the design of the cladding system on Grenfell Tower” where its product “constituted approximately % of the insulation and was used as a substitute product without Kingspan’s knowledge in a system that was not compliant with the building’s regulations”.Ulster Rugby has repeatedly told the Belfastthat it will not be making any comment in relation to its corporate relationship with Kingspan whilst the Grenfell Tower inquiry is ongoing. But Baroness Kate Hoey believes “it’s important that Ulster Rugby clary to the public their position on this, as clearly there is a growing campaign about Kingspan’s involvement”.Nicola Browne, co-ordinator of NI campaign group Act Now, said a petition calling on Ulster Rugby to end its lead sponsorship was attracting hundreds of signatures.“Hundreds of people in Northern Ireland, including their own supporters, are getting behind Act Now’s call for Ulster Rugby to end this sponsorship deal now and stop whitewashing Kingspan’s image, which is prolonging the pain of the Grenfell families.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSimon Case is investigating claims there was a lockdown-busting party at Number  last December By Patrick Daly, PA Political CorrespondentDecember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Health Secretary said the probe into allegations of a Number  Christmas party could be widened to include other claims, as the Conservatives admitted a rule-breaking gathering took place at their headquarters.Sajid Javid said he has been given “assurances” by “senior” officials that no Covid rules were broken by Downing Street staff on December , but that it is for Cabinet Secretary Simon Case to use his investigation to “get to the bottom” of whether lockdown-busting events were held last year.The Cabinet minister told LBC: “If the rules were not broken, then a party could not take place.Simon Case is free to look at whatever dates he wants to considerHealth Secretary Sajid Javid“But having this investigation, having the Cabinet Secretary look into this, is the right response because this is the inidual who can talk to anyone, can get the data, the evidence together and establish the facts.”It came as the Tories confirmed an event organised by Shaun Bailey’s failed London mayoral campaign took place in the party’s Westminster headquarters on December  while the capital was in Tier  restrictions.According to the Times, the “raucous” party took place in the HQ’s basement, was attended by No  aides and featured dancing and wine-drinking into the early hours despite indoor social mixing being banned at the time.Mr Javid said he has no knowledge of that event, but suggested the head of the Civil Service could choose to delve into what happened as part of his investigation.“I do know that Simon Case is not just looking at a particular date,” Mr Javid said. “He is free to look at whatever dates he wants to consider.”Mr Case’s inquiry was ordered by the Prime Minister after a leaked video emerged showing Downing Street aides laughing about a “fictional” party at Number  in December .During a press conference on Wednesday, Boris Johnson also appeared to concede that the Cabinet Secretary would be able to go further than just reviewing the events of December  and “look at other things”, with other alleged gatherings in Downing Street over the festive period last year.Allegra Stratton became the first casualty of the leaked footage when she, in an emotional statement to the press outside her north London home, stood down on Wednesday.The Health Secretary said he is “not quite sure” why Ms Stratton, who had been Boris Johnson’s spokeswoman before moving to work on the Cop climate conference, chose to quit, but he suggested it could have been because she was “embarrassed” by the

investigation into claims of Government parties in the run up to Christmas  The footage showed aides laughing about an alleged social event while rehearsing for subsequently-ditched televised press briefings in No ’s £. million media room, and after it emerged on Tuesday night the Government opted not to put Mr Javid up for Wednesday’s morning broadcast interviews as initially planned.Asked about that decision, he told Sky News: “I didn’t appear because I saw that video – it upset me, it upset a lot of people I think across the country, it upset the Prime Minister.“It wasn’t about refusing– I spoke to my colleagues in No  and we actually agreed it is best to take some time to respond to the video in the way that the Prime Minister has now, by ordering an investigation by the Cabinet Secretary.”Pressed on whether he thought an event did take place last December in Downing Street, he added: “The truth is, I don’t know.“I have received assurances, like the Prime Minister has, that all rules were followed throughout the pandemic at all times.”Where there is evidence, it should be handed over to the Met Police because nobody is above the law. It cannot be one rule for everybody , and another for the Prime Minister and Downing Street. pic lVpatZAv— Angela RaynerDecember , Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said the Cabinet Office probe should be “very easy and quick to do” as she called for those involved in the party to be “dealt with”.Her comment came as Ed Oldfield, a broadcast adviser to the Prime Minister who was heard asking Ms Stratton a practice question about a rumoured Downing Street party in the video obtained by ITV News, avoided answering whether he plans to resign when confronted by Sky News on Thursday.Ms Rayner told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “There was over  people alleged to be at one of the parties doing secret Santa on WhatsApp, so that evidence should be collated and should be given to the Met Police.“It’s not one rule for them and one rule for everyone . They’re not above the law. They should be dealt with.”The politan Police acknowledged it had received “a signicant amount of correspondence” relating to the alleged breaches in No  in the run up to Christmas last year but said they do not “provide evidence of a breach” of Covid rules.But the force did leave open the possibility of further inquiries by saying it would consider “any evidence” that emerges in the Case inquiry.

The low share of services in trade flows from Ireland to Northern Ireland is in contrast with the high overall services content of Ireland’s exports to other markets, ESRI report stated. Ireland is one of the main markets for services trade from Northern Ireland.   The reports, published on Tuesday, assess cross-border trade in services and “enhancing the attractiveness of the island of Ireland” to high-value foreign direct investment . The first of the set of economic reports examines the extent of cross-border trade in services on the island of Ireland and the characteristics of the firms participating in this trade. The main services traded include transportation and storage, business services and computer consultancy. Sales to Ireland account for % of services outflows from Northern Ireland and for % of services inflows to Northern Ireland, the report states. For trade from Ireland, Northern Ireland accounts for slightly less than % of total services exports from Ireland. This reflects the relatively small size of the Northern Ireland economy and the highly export-orientated and FDI-dominated structure of Ireland’s services sector. In terms of the balance of trade, the report found that more services are exported from Northern Ireland to Ireland relative to those from Ireland to Northern Ireland. Examining the characteristics of services firms active in cross-border trade, the report finds that exporting firms in services are systemically larger and more productive than non-exporters. The author of the report, professor Martina Lawless, said: “The patterns identied in this report suggest that there is considerable scope for expansion of cross-border trade in services. “The monitoring of the effectiveness of trade support policies would be greatly improved by expanding and coordinating the information collected on cross-border services flows.” This second research report provides novel evidence on factors and policies underlying the attractiveness of Ireland and Northern Ireland to FDI in high-value knowledge-intensive sectors.      This research also explores opportunities for policy coordination and cooperation on the island of Ireland that could enhance the attractiveness of both jurisdictions to high-value FDI. The research finds that FDI in high-value sectors in Ireland and Northern Ireland accounts for substantial shares of all new greenfield FDI projects. At over %, these shares are higher than the corresponding averages for Great Britain and the EU countries. Speaking ahead of the launch of the reports, Tanaiste Leo Varadkar, said: “We commissioned this research to provide a high-quality evidence base for looking, in real terms, at how we could do more, and do better together, across both parts of this island. “How we could align better, levelling up and taking the best of both jurisdictions. “The research shows that there is much more scope to ‘think all-island’ when it comes to the services economy and attracting foreign direct investment, accruing economic and societal benefits both North and South.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby.

Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

Owner of Ferry Clever, Christopher Ferry, said he believed it was more important than ever to shop local this Christmas. “Everything was in lockdown and a lot of small local businesses really got affected by that. I think this is probably the most important year ever regarding supporting local because a lot of businesses really struggled to get back on their feet after being closed for so long. “I think that people realise that, and they are really going all out this year to support local. A small business like myself doesn’t take it for granted, I really appreciate it and I would just really push to support local this year especially. Big operators like Amazon can be handy but your small spend makes a giant dference.” Ben Allen, owner of local record store ‘Abbazappa,’ spoke of the benefits of choosing to shop local. “I know my customers. I know them by name, they know me. The thing about a record shop is when a customer is with you evenit’s only for a few minutes, you’re that person’s best friend and you can talk about music, recommend things, and talk about all sorts. That doesn’t happen online. Online is completely soulless.  Ben Allen, proprietor of Abbazappa.  “The greatest thing on earth is being able to look through the products in the likes of a record shop or book shop physically. It’s a pleasure to do that. You can pick it up and seethe products okay before buying it. You can’t do that online, it’s a bit of a lucky dip.” Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA, Paacutedraig Delargy, also urged the people of Derry to support local businesses this year. “On the back of the voucher scheme, we’re encouraging everybody to spend their pound in local businesses as it’s been such a tough couple of months for them. Anything that can be done to make sure these businesses get back on their feet, we need to do it and make sure we can support our local high street shops.” The new Ferry Clever store can be found at - Bishops Street, and Abbazappa Records can be found at the Yellow Yard on Palace Street.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

The discovery of a new iant may also present new challenges so I would urge the Minister to revisit her approach to COVID in schools. High Efficiency Particulate Air filters remove contaminants such as viruses from the air, reducing airborne transmission in classrooms with poor ventilation. “It is clear that HEPA filtration is one of a number of mitigations which could help make our classrooms safer. “The Minister has dithered and delayed on ventilation for too long. It is crunch time for our schools. I am calling on the Minister today, to act urgently to examine the provision of HEPA air filtration for all of our classrooms. “The Minister keeps telling us she wants to keep schools open. We agree, but she has to be willing to do what it takes and that means HEPA filters in all of our classrooms, not just some ofthem. Sinn Feacutein will continue to work to ensure the safety of our children and young people as well as our school staff.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

John Hume was widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the recent political history of Ireland and one of the architects of the Northern Ireland peace process. The prizes to his name include the Nobel Peace Prize , the Martin Luther King Jnr Non-Violent Awardand the International Gandhi Peace Prize . His we Pat led the announcement and following her recent passing it is the continued wish of the Hume family and Foundation that they be loaned to and displayed in the city. Chair of the Business and Culture Committee, Councillor Conor Heaney, welcomed the key stage in the process of having the items displayed in the city. I am pleased that we have been able to approve the funding for the display of the John Hume Peace Awards in the Guildhall so that the public can view these internationally signicant items, he said. John is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the recent political history of Ireland and was one of the architects of the Northern Ireland Peace Process. He is the only person in the world to have received all three of these awards and their prominent display will give just recognition to that achievement and add to our offering to visitors to our City and District. The paper was presented by Head of Culture at Council,AeidinMcCarter, who added: The Hume Family wish for as many people to see the collection on display as possible and it has been agreed that the Guildhall will be the most appropriate and fitting venue to display them in. Theyare expected to go on display later next year. Speaking at the Committee meeting yesterday, SDLP councillor Rory Farrell said: This is a fantastic gt from the Humefamily to the people of this city. John and Pat are sadly no longer with us,but their legacy lives. Their legacy ispeace, it’s peaceful change. It’s the power of dialogue over violence and John in particular was widelyrecognised and revered for hiscontribution to peace on this island. Hes the only person in historyto be awarded the three big peace prizes and the Humes family have loaned thosethree prestigious awards to the peopleof this city. So, I think its right andI think its proper that those are awardsare publicly displayed in the Guildhallso locals and visitors alike canappreciate and understandthe magnitude of John and Pat’sachievements.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

It also states the need for increasing the notication period for utility companies to implement price rises and introducing a cap on energy company profits. On publishing the report, Ms McLaughlin said:“Households across the North are struggling right now. Between the cut to Universal Credit, increasing national insurance contributions, the runaway cost of oil, gas and electricity, people are finding it really dficult to make ends meet. To date, our First Ministers have shown no political will or, it has to be said, interest in tackling it. “The SDLP is publishing this action plan, setting out our view on how hard-pressed households can be supported in the short and long term. This includes direct support by extending the Winter Fuel Payment to Universal Credit recipients who have already had their payments cut by the Tory Government and facilitated by Sinn Feacutein Ministers. We are also proposing a Warm Home Discount Scheme that would reduce energy costs by facilitating the installation of insulation while decarbonising our housing stock. “We are also seeking to reform the structural issues that have led to successive price rises at short notice to households. That should include extending the period that companies must give notice to consumers before a price rise takes effect. This will allow families time to prepare for signicant increases rather than being caught on the hop at times like Christmas when energy use is traditionally higher. “I don’t believe that the First Ministers understand the scale of this crisis. Nor do they seem to be engaged in the action needed to relieve pressure on people across the North.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

She took to Facebook in a search for information about the school after noticing it as she travelled up and down the road. “I had been passing this school every day and was just fascinated by it. I wondered what it was called, when it was up and running, when it closed,” she told the County Derry Post. “Wee country schools like that had generations of families in them, and it was just something I became fixated on. “I wanted to know what it was called, andanyone had any memories or photographs of it. It was really to get a lot of people talking about it. “I wanted to stir up a bit of nostalgia among the community that was linked to the school, and was hoping that it would bring a lot of people back in touch with each other. “One lady hilariously came back and said there were some she could do without getting in touch with, and that made me laugh.”  Councillors raise County Derry road issues with DfI officials  Department officials were speaking at a recent full council meeting.   Despite that particular womans reluctance, Julie was able to gather a huge amount of information on the old school, which had been in use for almost  years. Opened in , the school had undergone two extensions in its -year stint, and at the time of its closure, Mr Noel Cunningham, who had links to the RAF, was the principal. A Mrs Carson taught at the school around the same time, while there were two dinner ladies named Bertha Clarke and Greta McKinney. Julie said she had been contacted by  past pupils of the school during her search for its history. “I ordinarily wouldnt have been out this road, but now being on it every day, I see it, so I thought Id put it out and seewe got anything back,” she said. “People were putting up messages, tagging people and asking Is this the school you were at  and I wondered how long it has been since those people were in touch with each other. “I thought it was a really lovely site a quaint country school, and there arent many of them around. I know its up for sale so I thought Id like to know the history before anything happens to it.” The derelict site at Killure PS. Despite the relatively recent closure of the school, photographs have proved dficult to come by for Julie, with just one unearthed so far. She is appealing for anyone with information or photographs to get in touch with her via the Derry Post to pass on what they know. “If anybody had photographs it would be a lovely thing for me to be able to share with everybody,” she said. “It was just to see what I could get back about it for them. I dont know these people I dont know any of them, but theyve all been so lovely in coming back to me. “Surely to goodness, after all thatof time, the papers would have covered a school like that closing ” If you have any information or photographs relating to Killure School, Drumcoon Road, Aghadowey, get in touch with us via editor@derrypostor give us a call on .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec Email: editor@derrypost  addthis, A County Derry group within the Ulster Farmers Unionhave welcomed the further roll out of a local broadband provider into Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Fibrus is currently developing full-fibre infrastructure in rural parts of Northern Ireland, and as part of the process, has struck up a partnership with the UFU. The company became affinity partners of the UFU, meaning their members are able to avail of special rates for its broadband services. James Graham, Group Manager of the South Derry Londonderry UFU said full-fibre broadband would have a major impact on how farmers in the area live and work. “Having access to effective and efficient connectivity services is now essential to those working in our industry,” he said. “This new network will help boost our mission at UFU to support a vibrant and sustainable farming economy. “Modern farming practices and administrative processes have become increasingly digitalised, so connectivity has quickly become a crucial utility on our farms. “We have secured an excellent deal with Fibrus which is available to all our members, so we hope many of them take up this beneficial opportunity - as I have already.”  INTERVIEW: Cllr McPeake: Broadband is a priority  The Mid Ulster councillor says Project Stratum needs to be carefully managed.  Liam Tunney speaks to local Sinn Feacutein councillor Sean McPeake about council pragmatism, his role models and helping St Brigids Mayogall go viral last year.   The live network was launched last week in Magherafelt, and Fibrus Brand and Marketing Manager Joe Diver said rural regions had been living in the digital darkness. “That’s why we are committed to connecting communities and equipping families and rural businesses - whether SMEs or farming businesses - with the tools to thrive in modern times,” he said. “We are already making our way across Northern Ireland, transforming connectivity in these areas and addressing the digital imbalance that exists between urban and rural. “Working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union has helped us to identy ways to support local farms and agri-businesses specically, which we know make up a major portion of rural economies. “We’re delighted to now be live in Mid Ulster and look forward to seeing those who need it most, reap the benefits of our hyperfast broadband services.” For more information on the work of Fibrus and the Ulster Farmers’ Union partnership, visit www.fibrus ufu.

They provide training and education to make the Deaf community hearing aware, and the hearing community deaf aware. Rose Ayling-Ellis is making history as the first deaf contestant to compete on Strictly Come Dancing, and information officer for the charity, Pauline Doherty last night heaped praise on the -year-old dancer.  “It is great to see Deaf Culture being recognised. Deaf Awareness and sign language shouldbe taughtto everyonein schools,” she said. In a recent episode, Rose and her partner Giovanni danced a section of their performance without any music and Pauline found that moment very important for the Deaf community. “When Rosie danced with no music to show hearing people what Rosie was feeling, it was fantastic,” said Ms. Doherty. Rose has been an inspiration to young people all over the UK and the Dungiven based charity have been unequivocal in their praise for young dancer. “Rose is fantastic, I love watching her and I really hopes she wins,” said Wendy Cassidy, cleaner at Hands That Talk. Paddy Bradley the caretaker smiled and said “Yes, Rose is very good. It’s nice to see Deaf people on TV,” he added.

She cannot wait to see Rose every week, and she hopes Rose will win it,” he said. Hands That Talk provide a comprehensive programme that includes educational courses, training, recreational and social activities including a Signing Choir. Further information on courses or outreach projects can be found via their website.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain.

On Friday, June , their  and  U Feacuteile teams will play in a novel charity game, with all the funds going help Kevin and his family. “We are trying to raise as much money for Kevin and his family as possible,” said Philip Muldoon, one of the organisers. “We want the good people off Ballinderry and surrounding areas to come along and donate on the night of the match to keep the date free. “To any business people who would like to sponsor a prize for the raffle in the Bridge Bar afterwards they can do so by contacting myself or Karl Conlan. “Kevin is going to need a lot of help post and pre surgery and this will go a long way to doing that.” To mark the occasion Noel ONeill of Arboe based company ND Sports has made the outstanding gesture of sponsoring a one-off retro top for both teams.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The late Tommy OConnell.

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Liam Tunney Dec Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, Derrys Competitions Control Committeehas vowed to clamp down on the number of clubs moving fixtures for the  season. googletag.cmd.push In their report to the Derry GAA AGM, the CCC said that of  games played during the  season,  games had been moved away from their original date. The figure excludes changes made before the beginning of the season to accommodate club requests, and the CCCs report said clubs need to stick to the deadline for making changes. “A weekly fixtures list is sent to clubs and any changes for the incoming week should be notied by the given deadline,” they said. “There is a tendency for club managers to agree last minute changes among themselves, sometimes not even informing their club secretary. “The original referee is not always available for the changed date time and this is a headache for our Referee Administrator. “In  as per CCC policy there will be NO game changes accepted after Sunday night for the week ahead unless in exceptional circumstances.” Dungiven picked up the U Jack Cassidy Cup in , but the CCC have raised concerns about the age grade. Pic by Mary K Burke. Elsewhere in the report, the Committee stressed the need to take another look at the bridging competition between underage and senior, saying the U grade did not work well. They also urged clubs to be honest in choosing their grade, and said there were reports of players prevented from attending to ensure lower-sided games. “We ask clubs to ensure that they work with managers and team personnel when choosing the grade they enter for  , and that they aim to play  a side including all eligible players,” the report said. “There were worrying reports that some players were being told they were not needed on a given night to ensure a  a side game. “This should NOT be happening and especially not in the current climate when sporting activity is more important than ever.” Discipline has continued to be an issue, with figures provided by the CCC revealing one club had had  incidents dealt with during . The report indicated the CCC would deal with issues in the strictest manner possible. Our games are contact sports and accidental injury will inevitably happen, but a deliberate attack on an opponent or official, causing serious injury is inexcusable, and the fear is that one of these days something will go badly wrong, with terrible consequences for all involved, said the report. We need to hammer home to our players the danger of the one punch attack and instil in them a healthy respect for their opponents and officials. The disregard for the authority of referees, and the abuse directed at them, especially from young players gives rise for concern. These remain UNACCEPTABE and we will continue to deal with them in the strictest manner possible. We will implement whatever measures we need to protect players and officials and work to ensure our games are safer and more enjoyable for all. In his secretarys report to the AGM, Peter Keane said Derry was in a good place both on and off the field of play. He said the county was close to appointing their full time Head of Operations. “The County Executive will announce the appointment of a fulltime Head of Operations in the coming days,” said the report. “When we look at what has happened over the past couple of years which can be put down to a dedicated and hardworking Committee of volunteers backed up by determined sub-committees then this appointment can only lead to further development both on and off the pitch. “The appointee will have leadership skills, financial expertise, strategic planning skills, marketing skills -all attributes that will help Derry to achieve their objectives in the next few years.” The report also said Derry were in a fairly good financial position, pointing to the recent acquisition of a new sponsor and a number of appointments yet to come.  More recognition for All-Ireland winning Derry minors  A civic honours reception has been held in their honour.   “We have reaped the rewards of an excellent championship campaign which generated increased revenue compared with last year,” said the report. “Over the past few days we are glad to welcome the Errigal Group as the counties main sponsor for football and hurling for the next five years. “The Counties Marketing consultants Teneo are presently seeking further sponsors for Development squads and Naming Rights sponsorship for both stadia - announcements will be made soon.” Sean Keanes report ended with a rallying call for the coming year. “I look forward to working together with you all again next year as we play a vital role in putting Derry back on the map again,” he added.

I, like many other families, cycle with my we and three small children and this space and environment to enjoy that time together safely and without fear of accident or injury is a blessing, said Cllr Lewis.ldquoNewry Mourne and Down Council proudly supports active and healthy communities and this cycle lane connects the local council to Stormont in a collective effort to improve the health and wellbeing of residents through the promotion of cycling and the enjoyment of outdoor leisure.Cllr Lewis also congratulated his Slieve Croob colleague, Cllr Andrew McMurray, who has been proactive in ensuring the district is marked on the map in terms of provision of safe cycle routes.He also revealed that Cllr McMurray has challenged him to a timed lap of the new route when it opens and hopes the event will raise money for a local charity, while the duo have a bit of fun along the way.Cllr Lewis said he has asked the Department for Infrastructure to consider the needs of those who need access to agricultural land that runs adjacent to the new pathway and cycling route, during construction and when it is completed.ldquoLand along this particular route is utilised for barley, potatoes and grazing, with the ground rotated each season which means that the fields are regularly in use throughout the year, he explained.ldquoPolice regularly pull in farmers driving along this stretch of road requesting that they facilitate traffic flow by waiting in a lay-by, allowing the build-up of traffic behind them to pass.Cllr Lewis said he has asked the government department consider how itrsquos going to accommodate agricultural or slow-moving traffic, suggesting that the original lay-by structure in the area needs to be maintained and protected to allow for safe access.He added: ldquoThese issues certainly arenrsquot impediments nor am I seeking to cause an obstruction.

I am contacted about cleansing issues on a daily basis and while working with council staff a solution is found, butrobust processes and procedures were in place, this should be routinely completed and no major issues should arise.Cllr Sharvin says he is also keen to see greater attention on cleaning play parks, explaining that currently there is no formal process to do so and operates on adhoc basis.ldquoGiven the increase of use play parks during Covid and the councilrsquos objective to increase healthy living in our communities, itrsquos vitality important that we clean and maintain our play parks on a regular basis. Council officials have agreed to replace surface safety tiles at our play parks and I hope this programme will continue to be rolled out, he said.Cllr Sharvin said that following the recent workshop, council officers are to compile a report which will be discussed by councillors..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"District’s battering from Storm Barra  ","story":"DOWN District was pummelled by Storm Barra yesterday with gale force winds and driving rain coinciding with a spring high tide to wreak havoc.Thunder and lightning was added into the heady weather mix with the storm conditions bringing down a number of trees along the coastline.

He and his we, Charlotte, live near Edinburgh and have three sons, Angus, Jack and Hector.His introduction to rowing came only six years ago when he took up skf racing. He competed at the  world championships in Strangford Lough where he won a silver medal and went on to win two gold medals at the  world championships in Stranraer.Clive admits to being highly competitive and that after winning world titles he was looking to take another step forward.A TV documentary about explorer Ben Fogle and Olympic rower James Cracknell rowing across the Atlantic fired his imagination and he signed up for the Talisker Atlantic Challenge in January  along with his medal-winning team-mates, Ian Baird, Duncan Hughes and Ross McKinney, plus a friend, Fraser Potter.They formed a team, Five in a Row, and then set about putting their project together, which involved the not inconsiderable matter of raising pound, to cover their costs.They managed to get the money and then obtained a boat, which, they were delighted to learn, had been rowed by three Scottish brothers in a previous Atlantic Challenge race.Clive says: ldquoIt was tough going, but we managed to raise the money. The boat is excellent, but we tried to lighten it as much as possible in order to make easier. Even so, we are putting in enough food and water to last a minimum of  days, plus our clothes and sleeping gear.The boat will also carry navigation and safety equipment, plus satellite phones to keep in touch with their loved ones and other competitors.During the voyage, three crew members will be rowing at any time, while the other two are resting, and safety harnesses will be worn at all times.ldquoWersquove trained hard and prepared well and I know that racing two kilometres in a skf race bears no comparison with what lies ahead, but wersquore all looking forward to the race, Clive added.Clive and his team-mates are hoping to raise pound, for the Reverse Rett charity, which supports children with Rett Syndrome, a neurological degenerative disease.Anyone wishing to make a donation is asked to go to visit https:www.justgiving fundraising ross-mckinney.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  December 12%2C 2001  ","story":"SAINTFIELD ndash Saintfield is in line for a new multi-million pound hotel development which is set to create up to  jobs.

pop royalty and real-le royalty, George Lowdenrsquos guitars are known to be the best in the world.The Prince of Wales recently made known his knowledge of and fascination with Georgersquos guitars and Ed Sheeran reportedly likes to keep one handy in nearly every room of his house.With Niall Horan of One Direction and Dubliner singer songwriter Dermot Kennedy becoming the latest owners of the bespoke guitars, Georgersquos company, Lowden Guitars, has just announced its latest collaboration with Sheeran.To celebrate the release of his most recent album, Sheeran has teamed up with George, who founded the firm in , to design and create a signature guitar worthy of music royalty.The Sheeran by Lowden Equals Edition guitar will also be available to the public to purchase, with a limited edition run of , available through Lowdenrsquos global dealer network.Itrsquos the second joint project with Sheeran, following on from their range of more affordable guitars.The latest achievement comes in the wake of George recently meeting the Prince of Wales at a Windsor Castle reception to mark Lowden Guitars winning the  Queenrsquos Awards for Enterprise.He also launched a new range of limited edition guitars to mark his th birthday over the summer which features specications chosen by George.Itrsquos all a far cry from when the renowned luthier first began to hand-make guitars for his own use.He could never have known that his determination to make the best guitar would see his name travel around the world and be spoken of by royalty.ldquoTherersquos quite a lot of things that have happened that I never could have imagined. When I started out, I had no formal training in the manufacture of guitars, explained George.ldquoIn a way, that gave me the confidence to take some risks, innovate and produce an instrument that has a completely unique voicing.He found the Prince of Wales to be very interested in the guitarsrsquo manufacture and may have even suggested a new development.ldquoWe had a great chat and he asked quite a lot of questions about the wood, all kinds and how we found it, said George.ldquoHe was also very interested in dieback ash, asking aboutit would be a very good way to use the trees as a lot have perished due to this disease.ldquoIt wouldnrsquot be the best toned wood you could find but Irsquove been thinking more about that since and wondering whether we could use it for guitar necks or not so we might do a little experiment to seeit works.From creating coveted instruments for top Irish and UK guitarists in the know, Lowden Guitars have become an international sales success mdash hence the Queenrsquos Award.George explained: ldquoThe company is far bigger than I ever envisaged. In some ways itrsquos good but I never tried to expand the company and get the kind of growth we have enjoyed. It just kind of happened over the years as organic growth which has been great.His guitars tend to sell by word of mouth from musician to musician and the actual experience of playing a Lowden and relishing its distinct tones at first hand.ldquoWherever in the world where we sell, we are still quite a niche, upper end company so the guitars are at the highest price level in all of the countries, said George.ldquoItrsquos a natural process where people see the guitars for the first time. They go into a shop and then over a period of a few years the reputation builds within that country. Our presence also grows and then we move into more specialist guitar shops, so it all takes time.ldquoI remember as a teenager I was mad keen to get a Gibson  which I saw in Matchettrsquos shop window in Belfast all those years ago and I couldnrsquot afford it.ldquoIf something is really good, and the young player comes in and plays it but canrsquot afford it, it goes into his or her mind and later on they find a way to afford it.George says the Covid pandemic has not impact on sales, although it has had other consequences.George said: ldquoIt didnrsquot impact on us for sales as our order book remained very firm but it was more to do with making the guitars as we had to completely re-organise the factory for better social distancing which was very expensive.ldquoWe had to close down the factory for a while in order to do that and more with people having to isolate it proved challenging..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Magpies fly high in Breffni Park  ","story":"DOWN kingpins Kilcoo qualied for an Ulster semi-final after a good performance at Kingspan Breffni Park on Saturday evening, defeating Cavan-based Ramor United by  points.The Magpies, reigning Ulster champions, will meet Glen of Derry in the last four in what will be a massive clash in two weeks time.It was tit-for-tat early on but the home side got a massive confidence boost in the fth minute via a well taken Sean McEvoy goal, their most impressive performer on the night.Kilcoorsquos response was emphatic though, firstly Ceilum Doherty stuck over a nice point and then that man Jerome Johnston done what he does best and fired to the net to put his side into a lead they would never relinquish.Further scores from Ryan McEvoy, Shealan Johnston and Doherty again sent them in four up at the water-break.The second period of the first half turned out to be poor affair with both sides missing good scoring chances.

McCollam fired over another point in the th minute and pointed a free at the very end while trying to it in on the Downpatrick area to poach a late goal.McCloskey didnrsquot score in the second half and being out of general play resulted in his normally reliable free-taking also taking a hit.At the other end the outnumbered Downpatrick forwards had to survive on scraps as well but they could always rely on their free-takers.Goalkeeper Pearse Smyth landed two points from inside his own half, while Tom McGrattan converted three frees and landed a point from play as well.McGrattan was the star of the game and he capped a brilliant inidual performance with two late plays that effectively took his team into the final.With the game in the balance at - each in the rd minute, McGrattan jinked his way along the sideline under the stand to win himself a free.It was an acute angle, but the Portaferry clubman arrowed the sliotar between the uprights.Then less than a minute later he played a beautul cross-field pass into the path of mid-fielder Finn Turpin, who stepped inside the defender and hit the roof of the net from  metres out.St Patrickrsquos were through to their first ever Danske Bank Mageean Cup final where they will play St Patrickrsquos Maghera at the Dub Arena on Friday week, December .But back again to that breath-taking first half.After five minutes, the teams had each scored three points. By the tenth minute, Jack McCloskey had cut through the Red High cover and shot to the net off the base of the right hand post.Within three minutes Downpatrick were a point up. McGrattan went around the left side of the Ballymena defence at full pace to rle to the roof of the net for one of the best goals that you will see at any level.Aodhan McGarry responded by pointing from a side-line and the water-break broke the action at - each.McGarry started the second quarter scoring with a fine point but a run of three successive scores from Finn Turpin, McGrattan and Oisin Coulter edged the Red High ahead again.However, three frees from Jack McCloskey and a point from Ronan McCollam put Ballymena in the lead by - to - at half-time.By the second water break Downpatrick were - to - ahead, mainly through frees and St Louisrsquo were now looking for scores from distance.The next  minutes went scoreless. In hindsight Ballymena snatched at a couple of scoring chances that might have put pressure on the eventual winners who pumped a lot of ball in high on the north Antrim defence with no .Eventually sub Tom McFerran brought the teams level and McCollam from the left wing gave St Louisrsquo the lead. The gauntlet had been thrown down for the Red High.Oisin Coulter landed a much-needed Downpatrick point in reply and they held firm until Tom McGrattan delivered the match-winning scores.It is scant consolation for Ballymena that they played their part in a fine display of schoolsrsquo hurling, but a number of players stood out including Daire McMullan, Connor Dickson and Dara Martin in defence and McCollam and McCloskey in attack until tempered by Downpatrickrsquos packed back line.Defence was ultimately the winning of the game, but they would not have got across the line without Turpin, Oisin Coulter and especially the mercurial Tom McGrattan.As a hurling disciple of the great Bro Charles in the s, I was a proud man leaving the Dub on Friday evening.For the generations of hurlers who climbed to the top of the hill on Saul Street each morning over the past  or  years, winning a Mageean was just not on the radar.This team is only  minutes from achieving what for us was the impossible.St Patrickrsquos: P Smyth - frees, J Ruddy, R OrsquoNeill, D Coulter, S Mageean, D Mallon, C Lenaghan, T Connolly -, F Turpin -, M Dorrian -, A Connolly, T McGrattan - , O Coulter -, R McGrath, S McCarthy.Subs: F MacManus for A Connolly , LMcCabe for S McCarthy , F Casey for R McGrath ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Road officials set to carry out survey at Ballynahinch school  ","story":"PLANS by roads officials to carry out a survey on the main road outside Ballynahinch Primary School have been welcomed by Strangford MLA Peter Weir.The work will be carried out to assess the potential for a new pedestrian crossing and while pleased that the survey is to take place, Mr Weir is disappointed that there are no current plans to also introduce a temporary mph speed limit at the Dromore Road as part of a province-wide Department for Infrastructure initiative.Mr Weir mdash who has met with school principal Mr Michael Moore mdash said the safety of children who have to cross the busy road was of paramount importance and a real issue of concern for parents and residents.The former Education Minister said he was ldquodisappointed that the school had not been included in the Roads Departmentrsquos part-time mph speed limit scheme.ldquoI believe that the Department needs to give a clear commitment that Ballynahinch Primary School will be included in the next roll-out of the scheme, said Mr Weir.ldquoThe Dromore Road is busy and is also a bus route.

In my opinion, such an appointment is crucial and could benefit the town and the business community a great deal.ldquoThe night time economy is one area that needs to be improved not only in Downpatrick but where, but rapid progress this in the current Covid climate may not be possible.ldquoHowever, there is no reason why ideas to regenerate our night time economy cannot be discussed now to lay plans for the future, he continued.Cllr Curran said every high street is dferent, with many people keen to see them become vibrant shopping hubs at the heart of local communities, explaining that the work of the Stormont task force could not be more timely.He added: ldquoAnything that can be done to increase footfall in our town centres in the future will be more than welcome.The call for evidence document is available at https:www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk consultations call-evidence-high-street-task-force, while responses to the call for evidence can be made to highstreet@communities-ni.gov.uk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13281294.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: ldquoI took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.ldquoIt is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.ldquoThis decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.ldquoThis decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.ldquoThese housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.ldquoSince my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast ndash that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.ldquoKeeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.ldquoAdhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.ldquoMy officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yeats. These were champions of Irish culture who disliked the shrunken Irishness of the new Free State and, in a pivotal moment in Irish-English relations, voted with their feet to demonstrate that their Irishness included Britain and the world. Recently, the Dublin-born Mary Kenny, who lives in Kent, defended Edna O’Brienfrom Irish attack for accepting her Dame of the British Empire honour in , on the grounds that the Irish were active in the Empire, too. Unless you insist that race or ethnicity defines nationality, Dame Edna is as British as I am. That southern Irish professionals are punching above their demographic weight in Britain is clear when you ponder their number in front of the cameras and behind the microphones of the BBC, over and above Graham Norton: the late Dave Allen, Des Lynam OBE and his nephew Joe Lynam, Dara O’Briain, Fergal Keane, the ex-convent schoolgirl Orla Guerin MBE, Al Ryan, Angela Scanlon, Declan Harvey and Donnachadh McCarthy. There must be dozens of Irish at the BBC, ITV and Channel Four — producing, directing, scripting, research-assisting. Hundreds of Irish work at the heart of British culture and help it pump the blood of that culture. Their CVs often reflect an entirely English le, as do those of countless Irish academics. At the summit are such eminences as professors Roy Foster from Waterford , Eamonn Duffy, a “cradle Catholic”from Dundalkand Bernard O’Donoghue from County Cork .Professor Louise Richardson FRSE, a Catholic from Tramore, is the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford and arguably the highest ranking academic in the UK. Professor Adrian Hill from Dublin is Director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford and directed the search for the anti-Covid  vaccine. Working under him is Professor Teresa Lambe from Kilcullen, Co Kildare.The current CEO of British Airways, the nation’s carrier, is Sean Doyle, who was born and reared in Youghal, Cork. He follows Willie Walsh from Dublin. Not even the sky is the limit for the Irish in the land of the ancient enemy. Yet bizarrely, the Irish cannot draw attention to their own success. Why the silence from both sides of the Irish Sea about Irish relocation to Britain The historian Diarmaid Ferriter writes that the silence was still in force when he left school in , a year in which , Irish people crossed the water to live. It is still in force. Tony Murray, a first-generation London-Irishman teaching at the London politan University, wondered in  why Irish writers have been so reluctant to portray the experiences of migration to London  “Is it shame, indference, or plain Irish contrariness ” When Richard Mulcahy, Fine Gael leader, dared in  to describe the attractions of Britain to Irish citizens, he was accused by Fianna Fáil of being recruiting sergeant for a foreign country to discuss the topic was regarded as unpatriotic. This suggests the answer. That code of silence must persevere among the migrants in Britain, for I read almost nothing by the Irish who are established in Britain about their being successful or contented.It would draw the ire of republicans. Victimhood, after all, is a plank of their , and success in Britain contradicts it and what Ferriter calls the “single, heroic nationalist narrative of Irish history”. Dara Ó Briain is trolled by the Irish Twitterati simply for being happy and thriving in Britain. “It’s always West Brit season for Irish celebrities working in the United Kingdom,” wrote Donald Clarke in . The cultivated Ó Briain, Irish speaker and GAA supporter, has responded wittily to his begrudgers: “By definition, I’m not a West Brit, because I actually live in Britain. I mean, get your insults straight, please”. Yet even O’Briain seems to me to be defensive, and understandably. The Dailyeconomics columnist, Liam Halligan, first-generation English from an Irish Catholic family, was attacked for his  criticism of Leo Varadkar for damaging Anglo-Irish relations by his attitude to Brexit. “As someone who physically embodies the binding blood and cultural ties between Britain and Ireland, I’m regularly attacked in the Irish media for having voted to leave”. He was supposed to revert to ethnic type and oppose Brexit on the simple grounds of anti-Britishness, not reflect his English upbringing, education, livelihood, and professional economic assessment of the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Yet, he wrote movingly, “Having grown up ‘London-Irish’ in the s and s, all I ever wanted was for the two countries that define my ethnicity to get on”. The TV presenter Laura Whitmore found out that while the Irish can have successful lives in Britain, they must not erge from the Irish Story that installs the British armed forces as devils incarnate. When Whitmore appeared in a  British Army podcast, interviewing a female soldier about body issues in a male-dominated occupation, she was tarred and feathered in the social media. This century-old control of the Diaspora is echoed by the Chinese Communist Party’s attempt to do likewise in the West and which we rightly deplore. Except, of course, cultural reality and demography suggest that the middle-class and professional-class Irish in Britain are not a Diaspora at all, but simply compatriots across the water. As a presenter who makes his living by talking, one might think Graham Norton should be able to articulate the position of the successful Irish in England. But when inin  he is asked: “What about the UK, his home for decades now ”, his answer from Cork is displacement activity. “There’s a lot of charity shops. I know that. We’re raising a lot of money for cancer. But see, that’s an odd thing I’ll do, where I’ll say ‘we’re’ raising a lot of money. And so I have that thing, because I’ve lived there since  my career is there, my friends are there, I pay tax there, I vote there. And I work for the British Broadcasting Corporation.” “And so, I’ve said this before, but it is that thing where I’m in London, I get on the plane, and I’m going home to Ireland. But when I leave here in September, I’m going home to London. And I think you can do that. I don’t think we have to be policed that strictly.” But who are these police whose authority causes him to wool-gather and prevents him from naming “that thing”, his dual identity  It seems tragic that a huge portion of Irish historical and present reality must be repressed and thus the potential for inidual and collective fulfilment wasted. Those who police the Irish attitude to the British are defied in silence daily, but silence is complicity in one’s own repression. I suspect that many southern Irish would be relieved by acknowledging Britain and Ireland’s intimate relations. But they are held to ransom in the name of the Cause. Yet fully acknowledging the intimacy is the starting-point on the road to final peace on these islands. The Taoiseach Michèal Martin has called for a “re-set” of the UK-EU relationship. Closer to home, he should call for a re-set of the UK-Ireland relationship and add an “s” to the second word of his Shared Island Unit. Meanwhile, it is the intent of the republican campaign to de-Anglicise Northern Ireland and sunder it from the UK while Ireland gaily enjoys its unfettered but unacknowledged access to the UK via the media and the Common Travel Area.

Their future is terrying.”During his career, James competed in several athletic categories and won two gold medals for Great Britain at the  New York Paralympics. He denied he had caused a public nuisance. Extinction Rebellion’s occupation of London City Airport was designed to highlight the climate impact of air travel.The most energy-intensive activity an inidual can undertake, no other human activity consumes as much energy in such a short time.Mile for mile, flying is the most climate-damaging way to travel.Extinction Rebellion has a number of cases going through the Crown Courts.James’s was the fourth jury trial, and followed the acquittal in April  of six people for criminal damage to Shell’s London HQ, despite all but one having no defence in law.In July this year, the UK government published its Jet Zero strategy to achieve net zero in the aviation industry by .Air travel is an elite activity.Only a tiny percentage of the global population can afford to fly and they have a disproportionate carbon footprint.Taking a long-haul flight generates more carbon emissions than the average person in dozens of countries around the world produces in a whole year.The government has repeatedly been advised by its own Climate Change Committee to limit the growth of aviation in the next  years, starting with a halt to airport expansion.The government’s suggestion, in its Transport Decarbonisation Strategy, that the public can continue to fly since aviation will be carbon neutral by mid-century have been widely ridiculed.The government has recently proposed a reduction in Air Passenger Duty Tax whilst the industry is already estimated to be subsidised by £bn per year.The news comes as the PCSC Bill, which has been widely criticised for seeking to limit the right to protests, s to the House of Lords for amendments.Zoe Blackler, Extinction Rebellion media officerFor more letters, opinion pieces, and News Letter editorials, go to this link:gt www.newsletter news opinion lt——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Everyone will want to meet with close family and friends and it’s important that people make informed decisions about that, and thatthey are meeting that they do so safely.“We all know the things that we can be doing to make those meetings safer. That is about getting vaccinated and getting our boosters once it’s our turn, and it is about wearing face coverings when we’re meeting indoors, and that it’s well ventillated.“Nobody invites me to parties any more so I shall be spending my time with my close family.”Northern Ireland’s Chief Scientic Advisor, Professor Ian Young, added: “I think it’s really important that we adhere to the guidelines that are in place. If meeting family and friends and socialising is important, as it is to many people, then I think it’s appropriate that we should do that.“If you do see me at any parties over the Christmas period, you’ll notice me staying near the window as much as possible and I can guarantee you I will have taken a lateral flow test beforehand.”Prof McBride, meanwhile, said it is important the rules apply equally to everyone following the furore surrounding reports of multiple reports of Christmas parties at Downing Street while the UK was still under lockdown.Sir Michael said: “I don’t know what went on or didn’t go on, but what I can say is there is no rule for one and dferent rules for everyone . These rules are there for all of us and it is in everyone’s best interests.“This is about controlling the pandemic, a pandemic that has taken a signicant toll in terms of lives lost and livelihoods impacted upon.”He added: “It’s particularly important that everyone abides by the rules and follows the regulations. “I think it’s important that the public see that we practice what we preach.”Paul GivanMichelle ONeillNorthern IrelandStormont Executive  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularSinn Fein rising star quit over paymentsTributes pour in for tragic dad whose smile would ‘light up a room’‘I was beaten out of estate with a baseball bat for being Protestant’Book extract: There is silence among the Irish about their relocation to Britain The ‘gradualism’ of the Northern Ireland Protocol fits the Irish republican strategyMost PopularMS have announced their Christmas dinner range for  - here’s what’s available, on sale now best men’s waterproof hiking trousers UK: stay dry hiking with trousers from Craghoppers, Berghaus, MontaneAldi releases two festive gin liqueurs for Christmas, including a Spiced Biscuit flavour - how to buyChristmas toys : popular toys expected to sell out this Xmas - including Paw Patrol and a fidget popper Food and drink gts: best Christmas food and drink hampers from Marks and Spencer, Aldi and Hotel Chocolat                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process. The DUP was looking for two-thirds.”Michelle Weir, Local Democracy Reporter--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe complaint to the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales against the Cardf and Vale University Health Board was lodged by the patient -referred to in the complaint as lsquoMr Drsquo -who was unhappy with the care and treatment he received at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardf during and after a scheduled admission for surgery to remove the right side of his colon.Mr D, who has Aspergerrsquos Syndrome, complained that hiscondition - at the time believed to be Crohns Disease -was not clearly diagnosed and that clinicians were slow to identy he suffered a post-operative bleed and needed further emergency surgery.He complained that information about his treatment and care was not provided clearly to him despite those caring for him knowing about his Aspergerrsquos Syndrome. He was also unhappy with aspects of his care after his discharge.Mr Drsquos surgery was carried out on the presumption that he had Crohnrsquos Disease according to the Ombudsman, but surgical findings suggested complex chronic appendicitis.The Ombudsman found that neither of these conditions needed the extensive surgery that Mr D was given. The Ombudsman also found there was no complete record of how his condition was monitored following his surgery and that his post-operative bleed might have been detected sooner.The Ombudsman also concluded that the clinicians were aware of the patientrsquos Aspergerrsquos Syndrome but did not clearly communicate the information about his diagnosis and treatment to him. The Ombudsman also found that the patient was not seen by a mental health clinician as requested by Mr D because it was not arranged.MORE NEWS:The Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint regarding Mr Drsquos care post-discharge.Nick Bennett of Public Services Ombudsman for Wales said: ldquoThis regrettable case highlights yet again the importance of one of the key principles of prudent healthcare formulated by the Welsh Government ndash lsquodo only what is needed and do no harm.rsquoldquoPhysicians responsible for Mr Drsquos care should have employed a lsquowatch and waitrsquo approach in which his condition would probably have settled without surgical treatment.ldquoInstead, Mr D, a vulnerable inidual, faced completely avoidable trauma of unnecessary surgery and post-treatment complications ndash a trauma which saw him seek mental health support. I anticipate that my findings will be extremely distressing for him. This is reflected in my recommendations in this case.The Ombudsman recommended that Cardf and Vale University Health Board provides Mr D with a detailed apology and a redress payment of pound,. Mr Bennett also recommended that the physicians and nurses involved in Mr Drsquos care have relevant training in the management of Crohnrsquos Disease and chronic appendicitis as well as the care and management of patients with Aspergerrsquos Syndrome.It was also recommended that the nursing team consider the importance of conducting and documenting post-operative observations and of preparing accurate and relevant care plans.The Ombudsmans report says Cardf and Vale University Health Board has accepted the findings and conclusions of the Ombudsmanrsquos report and has agreed to implement the recommendations.A spokesperson for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: \"As a health board we would like to reiterate our sincere apologies to Mr D for the concerns identied in the report.\"We are implementing the recommendations from the Ombudsman and an improvement plan has been developed to monitor the delivery of all recommendations within the agreed timescales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityExactly how fast the city should grow is up for debate as Cardf council launches a major consultation on its local development plan.Another issue is how many of these new homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.The development plan is a hugely important council document shaping how the city will evolve until , and the consultation runs for  weeks until February .The first phase of the consultation looks at how many new homes and jobs the city might need over the next  years, with three specic options. Currently developers already have plans for an extra , homesmdashwhich havenrsquot yet been builtmdashthanks to the existing local development plan.Although, itrsquos possible that not all of these will actually be built. Some additional lsquowindfall sitesrsquo are also likely to come forward, where developers build homes not allocated in the development plan.So factoring these in, the first option would mean an extra , homes needed, as well as , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , by .The second option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This could mean more affordable housing.The third option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This is based on population growth projections from the previous development plan, which some critics say were too high.Councillor Caro Wild, cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: ldquoThe replacement LDP is going to shape the look and feel of Cardf for years to come, so it was really important for us to hear as wide a range of views as possible. At this stage of the process, we are accessing a number of dferent scenarios on the possible levels of growth in Cardf up to , and the need for houses to be built to accommodate this growth..removeldquoIt is important that people understand the consequences of the options, as most growth scenarios will have pros and cons with regard to important issues such as land for employment opportunities, the impact on the environment, addressing housing need, supporting the delivery of community and transport infrastructure, and how many truly affordable homes that could be provided.People can respond to the consultation by visiting the website https:cardfldp.consultation.ai, while there will also be focus groups to gather views of people who donrsquot normally respond to council consultations.The next phase of the consultation explores eight options on how the city should accommodate a growing population, and how many homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.Option one would extend the existing strategic sites, built on countryside on the outskirts of the city. This would mean more affordable homes and a wider range of housing, due to the cheaper construction costs of building on greenfield sites.Options two and three would see new homes built mostly on urban brownfield sites, meaning land which has already been developed. This would mean denser housing, and could be more expensive to build with less range in size. Option four is similar, but focusing on building around existing district centres to create a lsquocity of villagesrsquo concept.Option five would see new homes built around existing transport links in urban areas while option six would focus growth around proposed transport improvements like the metro and planned new train stations, including on some greenfield sites.Option seven would focus on greenfield sites not already earmarked for development, on countryside on the outskirts of Cardf. Option eight would be a mix of using greenfield and brownfield sites, in urban areas and the countryside, to get the best of both.Cllr Wild added: ldquoAt this stage of the process, all of the options that are presented in the consultation are potential options, rather than preferred options. The preferred strategy could combine a number of these options together. All of the feedback from the public will be considered, alongside further technical work, which will help the council prepare the preferred strategy that will be consulted on with the public in autumn .This consultation follows a previous one held earlier this year, which focused on what the broader goals of the replacement development plan should look like. This included exploring how the city should face problems like coronavirus and the climate crisis. The final plan is expected to be approved in October . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We cant wait to take him.\"Ive been following the team for years and it was great to win the prize. Moomins name will be known to everyone around her now.\"The club confirmed Ms Williams - who is also the long-term partner of star striker Thomas Walters - won the prize.The club said: \"The stadium was named after her dog Moomin, who we are reliably informed is treated like a Prince.\"The competition raised vital funds in the quest for the club achieving a FAW Tier  License, with proceeds raised going towards much needed ground improvements such as floodlights.\"Reaction from fans has been positive, although much confusion on the stands last Saturday as to whether were still the Windmill Army or now the Moomin Army.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process.

Last week saw the completion of the booster programme to those in Supported Living accommodation, those attending Adult Learning Disability Day Care Centres, and those who are homeless. Residents, service-users in the community, and staff who were eligible for the vaccine booster received their jab at a total of  facilities spread right across the Western Trust area. Karen Hargan, Western Trust HR Director and Vaccination Programme Lead, said the programme just completed is testament to the Trust’s commitment to looking after some of the most vulnerable citizens in our community. “As a Trust, we are dealing with an ever-changing situation when it comes to vaccinations. As new iants come to light, and transmission rates alter, we have to adapt our plans accordingly. But one of our key priorities will always be to look after our most vulnerable citizens to ensure that they do not miss out, are protected from this virus, and are not left behind. “I would like to personally offer my thanks to all of the owners of these facilities and their staff for helping us to deliver this programme, and of course to our highly skilled and extremely dedicated vaccination teams, without whom programmes like these simply would not be possible.” For the latest information on the Western Trust’s vaccination programme please visit the Western Trust Vaccination Info page.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_effbdcebcefcaaffeca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbfcfbfadefd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1638984916407.jpg--covid_19___wed_8th_december_figures.jpg?163898491600","title":"covid  wed th december figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows five further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.
