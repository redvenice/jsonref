It is a fate worse than death.\u0027The conniving candidate also makes promises that go against her Democratic platform to get endorsements from congressmen, telling one that she\u0027ll increase the amount of land available for oil drilling and another that she\u0027ll outlaw same sex marriage. When her lesbian daughter Catherine (Sarah Sutherland) expresses outrage at that second promise, Selina replies: \u0027It\u0027s just the party platform, it\u0027s like a to-do list of things we\u0027re not going to do.\u0027          Selina\u0027s campaign adviser Kent Davison (Gary Cole) and former chief of staff Amy Brookheimer (Anna Chlumsky) are seen trying to convince her not to pick Jonah Ryan to be her VP. She responds by railing against the position she previously held, telling them : \u0027Being vice president is like being declawed, defanged, neutered, ball-gagged and sealed in an abandoned coal mine under two miles of human s***. It is a fate worse than death\u0027Perhaps Selina\u0027s largest hurdle is an investigation into the Meyer Fund, which her husband Andrew (David Pasquesi) was stealing money from using checks in her name. His scheme appears to be seconds from going public, threatening to ruin her chances and making the White House. Just before Selina goes on stage to accept her nomination, one of her advisers warns her that \u0027someone will have to go down\u0027 for the Meyer Fund. She says: \u0027I know\u0027 with an unnerving smile that makes it clear she\u0027s found a fall guy. Sadly, but not surprisingly, that fall guy is Gary Walsh (Tony Hale) the ever-loyal minder who has been by her side constantly. Though Gary can read Selina\u0027s mind in many situations, like when she\u0027s hungry or needs hand sanitizer, he doesn\u0027t see this one coming. He is standing on the edge of the stage offering Selina her favorite lipstick when she begins to tell him what she\u0027s done - before he interrupts her to pick a chia seed out of her teeth. Selina ends up just saying \u0027nevermind\u0027 with a shrug as she takes the stage to accept her nomination. While she\u0027s at the microphone she looks to the side to see a blindsided Gary being arrested by FBI agents.            One of the many schemes Selina orchestrated to seal her place in the Oval Office involved making her ever-loyal aide Gary Walsh (Tony Hale) take the fall for her husband\u0027s fraud         Selina winces on stage at the Democratic National Convention as she stands in front of the crowd with her disastrous new running mate Jonah Ryan (Timothy Simons)It\u0027s not until the last seven minutes that the episode feels like a finale. After the nomination scene the story skips ahead six months to see Selina settled into the Oval Office.  Sue Wilson (Sufe Bradshaw) is back to being Selina\u0027s brutally blunt receptionist, just as she was in earlier seasons.  When Jonah shows up looking to speak with Selina, Sue makes it clear in very few words that that\u0027s not going to happen. Seeing the vice president stand outside the Oval Office unable to get a minute with the president feels full-circle.  The next scene shows Selina in her office with her two top aides, her former campaign manager Bob Bradley (Martin Mull) and James\u0027 former campaign manager Michelle. She gripes about being hungry before calling out for Gary, who is presumably in prison. Bob reminds her that Gary isn\u0027t there and offers to get her something to eat. When he asks what she wants, Selina snaps: \u0027You figure that out\u0027 - something only Gary was ever able to do. The two aides leave the room and we see Selina\u0027s face fall as she realizes she\u0027s alone, having alienated everyone who helped get her into the White House. The moment doesn\u0027t last long - this is a comedy, after all.           The series flashes forward six months to show Selina sitting in the Oval Office and realizing she is all alone after driving everyone in her life awayThe final four or so minutes of the show take place 24 years in the future in 2044, just after Selina\u0027s death.   Reporting on the late president\u0027s funeral procession on TV is Selina\u0027s former communications director Mike McLintock (Matt Walsh). Having failed miserably in that role and struggled early on in his subsequent journalism career, a graying Mike appears to have finally hit his stride.  He gives the viewer a tiny glimpse into what happened with Selina\u0027s presidency as he describes how she freed Tibet and made good on her promise to outlaw same sex marriage.          Selina\u0027s former communications director Mike McLintock is anchoring the news during the late president\u0027s funeral. He gives the viewer a tiny glimpse into what happened with Selina\u0027s presidency as he describes how she freed Tibet and outlawed same sex marriageNext we see many of the core characters reunite at Selina\u0027s funeral, including several of her political rivals. Through Mike\u0027s newscast we learn that the current president is Richard Splett (Sam Richardson), the bumbling political aide who helped run Selina\u0027s campaign, despite her protestations.  Amy is happily married to campaign manager Bill Ericsson (Diedrich Bader) and is the proud mother to greyhounds. She catches up with an overly-botoxed and tanned Dan Egan (Reid Scott), now married to a 20-something blonde. Both Amy and Dan are shocked to see that Gary showed up for the funeral even though Selina apparently never visited him in prison. He places her favorite lipstick on her casket and whispers: \u0027You would hate these flowers.\u0027   We see Jonah watching the funeral from home, griping to his wife slash step-sister that he\u0027s glad he wasn\u0027t there. She responds that its a good thing he got impeached so they didn\u0027t have to invite him.  Catherine is also watching from home and celebrating being free from her judgmental and absent mother. Catherine\u0027s ex-Secret Service agent lover Marjorie Palmiotti (Clea DuVall) tells her now-grown son that \u0027losing a parent is hard\u0027 before the not-so-grieving daughter saunters in with a tray of margaritas and a big grin.          Gary showed up to Selina\u0027s funeral 24 years after she betrayed him even though she never visited him in prison.

I\u0027m not wishing that, I\u0027m saying anything could happen.\u0027 The spectacular overshadowing is a fitting end for Veep\u0027s bitter and battled anti-hero, who surely thought she deserved a much grander sendoff.             As the credits start rolling on one side of the screen, Mike comes back on and begins paying tribute to Selina before receiving breaking news that actor Tom Hanks has died at the age of 88"},{"url":null,"title":"Photograph restoration experts colourise private album snaps bringing everyday pictures life","story":" Another restored photo shows the grandfather of photographer Chris Dalton, also from London.

But the star endured a difficult childhood that was overshadowed by her parents\u0027 toxic marriageAlthough she made 39 films and many TV shows, she is best remembered for a song — Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be) — which she belted out to James Stewart in the Hitchcock film The Man Who Knew Too Much. Years later, Day liked to say \u0027Que Sera, Sera\u0027 to fend off intrusive questions about a personal life that was the opposite of the sparkling romances of her films.Although her wholesome, sunny image was a construct of her Hollywood advisors — the pianist Oscar Levant once quipped: \u0027I knew Doris Day before she was a virgin\u0027 — she didn\u0027t want to disappoint fans and she played along for years.She was born Doris Mary Ann Kappelhoff in a German neighbourhood of Cincinnati, Ohio, on April 3, 1922 — and suffered an unhappy childhood that was overshadowed by her parents\u0027 toxic marriage. Her father was a professional musician who hated popular songs — and to bait him, Day\u0027s mother would get the little girl to perform a song he particularly loathed.         Her third husband Marty Melcher was a pushy, greedy movie producer who insisted on having a cut in the proceeds from all her future filmsAs a young child, she caught her father with another woman, creeping into a bedroom during a party at their home. She recalled crying herself to sleep listening to them. \u0027I heard him and I heard her,\u0027 she said.From her childhood onwards, Doris said she dreamed of being the perfect wife with a perfect husband. It\u0027s possible she just tried too hard — at least two of her husbands would blame her for the break-up of their relationships while a third would say she was too exhausting to keep up with.Doris was encouraged by her mother to become a dancer but such ambitions were shattered when, aged 13, she was involved in a terrible car accident. The car, driven by a friend after a pahurty, became stuck on the rails at a level crossing and was crushed by an oncoming train. One of Doris\u0027s legs was crushed and she spent over a year on crutches.         The only fellow star with whom she stayed closely in touch was Rock Hudson. She claimed she loved him, although his homosexuality would have put paid to any romanceShe turned to singing instead. A local bandleader, Barney Rapp, gave her a job and her stage name after hearing her sing \u0027Day By Day\u0027. Doris was just 17 when she fell in love with trombonist Al Jorden who helped her with her singing. They married when she was 19.Jorden immediately showed a dark side to his character when he punched her on their wedding night, the first of many beatings. When she became pregnant, he insisted that she have an abortion. When she refused, he hit her in the stomach in the hope that she would lose their baby.She didn\u0027t, although by the time their son, Terry, was born, she had managed to flee her brutal and paranoid husband.For all her dreams of being the perfect wife, Doris was hardly the perfect mother. She soon went back on the road with her band and left her mother, Alma, to bring up her son. Terry — her only child — would later say that \u0027mother\u0027 was a word for him that had no meaning. \u0027My grandmother was my total parent,\u0027 he explained.         Ol\u0027 Blue Eyes: The iconic actress had on-screen magic in Young at Heart in 1965 with Frank SinatraDoris married second husband, George Weidler, a saxophonist, when she was 22. They lived in a trailer park and the marriage lasted just eight months. It was significant chiefly for Weidler introducing her to Christian Science — a faith notorious for hostility to modern medicine and its insistence that believers should heal themselves through prayer.Day would say of Weidler: \u0027We had a strong physical attraction for each other, but I didn\u0027t realise that it takes much more than that to make a marriage work.\u0027Even after they split up, they would occasionally reunite for bouts of passionate sex — behaviour that could not be more different from her screen persona and which fulfilled a need she never denied she had for physical relationships.She was also rumoured to have had an affair with Bob Hope — who she met frequently because Hope\u0027s musical director Les Brown was Doris\u0027s bandleader. Hope nicknamed her \u0027Jut Butt\u0027, explaining: \u0027You could play bridge on her ass.\u0027         Co-stars such as Kirk Douglas were amazed by her innocent frankness, wondering as they chatted over lunch if she was really being herself or \u0027in character\u0027Without any acting experience, Doris got her big Hollywood break when director Michael Curtiz — looking for an \u0027All-American Girl\u0027 —- cast her in the 1948 romantic comedy musical It\u0027s Magic.He spent most of the time during her screen test wiping away her tears. It was Curtiz who dubbed Day \u0027Miss Lachrymose\u0027 for her uncanny ability to cry on demand. Equally useful was her ability to memorise a script after reading it just once. The film instantly established Doris as a star at 26 and also set in stone — as far as Hollywood publicists were concerned — her image as squeaky clean. Co-stars were amazed by her innocent frankness, wondering as they chatted over lunch if she was really being herself or \u0027in character\u0027.Doris often played singers and hated lip-syncing so she usually sang live on the set.In 1951, aged 29, she married third husband Marty Melcher, a pushy, greedy movie producer who insisted on having a cut in the proceeds from all her future films. He was loathed in Hollywood, where he was known as \u0027Mr Day\u0027 for continually interfering in her career, making impossible demands that were usually for himself rather than her.He pressured her into making various films she had no interest in making, and turning down parts —such as the \u0027older woman\u0027 in The Graduate, that she wanted.         Doris, pictured with co-star Ronald Reagan, never felt comfortable being a Hollywood superstar or a sex symbolThey fought at work and in their private life. After he followed her into Christian Science, she complained bitterly that the faith became more important to him than their marriage.Christian Science almost proved the death of Doris while she was shooting the 1956 film Julie.Because of their shared religious faith, Melcher refused to let her see a doctor for weeks after she started haemorrhaging for what turned out to be an intestinal tumour.Eventually, she did see a doctor and had to have a hysterectomy. Decades later, Day — who returned to Christian Science in later life — would alarm friends concerned by her increasing frailty by baulking at taking even an aspirin.She left Melcher at least once but confided to friends that she needed —more than he did — the sexual side of their marriage. The star only learned Melcher had swindled her out of her £15 million fortune — leaving with her with debts of around £350,000 — after he died in 1968. He had also signed her up to a five-year contract for a TV series, The Doris Day Show, that she\u0027d known nothing about — although she accepted the part and it became a huge hit.Doris was charged with fraudulently trying to evade income tax and the allegation was only thrown out of court when she proved she\u0027d known nothing about what her husband had been up to.In the end she had a nervous breakdown — one symptom of which was when she ed fully clothed into a friend\u0027s swimming pool — but she eventually won $22 million (£17 million) in damages from Melcher\u0027s attorney and other associates who had mismanaged her money.In 1976, she married for the fourth time, to restaurateur Barry Comden. This time, Day studiously kept their marriage out of the limelight, not even mentioning him in her Who\u0027s Who entries, let alone allowing him to be photographed with her. However, they, too, ended up orcing six years later.All she could say was \u0027it is better that we live apart\u0027 while Comden claimed: \u0027She kicked me out of bed to make room for her animals.\u0027Doris had by then retired from showbusiness and public life, devoting her time to her pets and stray animals. She became known locally as deeply eccentric (although when a newspaper dubbed her a mad \u0027bag lady\u0027, she successfully sued). She would drive her own animal ambulance to a spot where she heard a dog or cat had been run over to care for it, and would appear in supermarkets counting out her discount coupons as she loaded up on pet supplies.She opened an animal hospital and turned her huge home over to her pets, serving them gourmet food and tucking dozens of cats and dogs into specially-made beds at night. Many dogs would pile on to her own kingsize bed.Doris never felt comfortable being a Hollywood superstar or a sex symbol. James Garner, who co-starred with her in two films, once described her as \u0027a very sexy lady who doesn\u0027t know how sexy she is\u0027.She largely cut herself off from her old life, not even attending her son\u0027s funeral when he died of cancer in 2004. Staff who looked after her complained she could be miserly and demanding, not even giving a former PA who broke a front tooth opening a pack of food the money to go to the dentist.In her later years, all but a handful of her smaller pets had to go as her carers grew terrified one might knock her over and kill her.The only fellow star with whom she stayed closely in touch was Rock Hudson. She claimed she loved him, although his homosexuality would have put paid to any romance. When she launched her last TV show — about dogs — in 1985, Hudson was at the press conference.She was stunned by his shattered physical appearance but, having no idea he had Aids, Doris reassured everyone he just had flu. Hudson died soon afterwards.The star once nicknamed The Virgin Queen for the purity of her roles went into hiding for weeks, spending most of the time doing what she always did so well: crying."},{"url":null,"title":"Six Greenpeace activists climb Sydney Harbour Bridge","story":"Share this article Police boats in the water and officers on the bridge were considering how to get the remaining three men down - before they lowered themselves and ended their protest.  Lane eight of the bridge was briefly closed due to the police operation but soon re-opened.  Climate change has been a key issue during the election campaign in which Labor leader Bill Shorten had criticised the Coalition government for inaction.

Leopoldo Lopez, founder of opposition party Primero Justicia and a political prisoner, was also accused of helping orchestrate the plot while under house arrest              Guaido\u0027s supporters still believe it will be possible to oust Maduro - on Monday air force general Ramon Rangel (pictured) backed them - but say it will take longer than plannedMaduro says he has full confidence in both Moreno and Padrino, saying they informed him of the plot a week in advance alongside presidential guard commander Ivan Hernandez.Figuera has been forced into hiding after Maduro branded him a \u0027traitor\u0027, while 10 opposition lawmakers have been charged over what the President terms a \u0027coup\u0027.Among them is Guaido\u0027s deputy, Edgar Zambrano, who was arrested outside congress after security forces hooked his car to a tow truck and drove off while he was still inside it.However, Maduro has not moved against Guaido amid threats of unspecified \u0027consequences\u0027 from the US if he does so.The plotters have also not given up hopes of pushing Maduro from his perch, but acknowledge the process will take longer than they hoped.On Monday an air force general, Ramon Rangel, joined the calls for Maduro to go, saying the country is being controlled by the \u0027communist dictatorship\u0027 in Cuba.\u0027We have to find a way to get rid of the fear, to go out into the streets, to protest, and to seek a military union to change this political system,\u0027 said Rangel on YouTube.Dressed in a suit with a copy of the constitution in his hand, he added: \u0027It\u0027s time to rise up.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Kathleen Chada wants life sentence term served before parole bid increased to 12 yearsThird level students to get opportunity to study for three months in Gaeltacht areasTransport strategy also calls for major upgrade of suburban rail services with six new stationsBruton says in light of interest in deal, firm will be asked if exact figures can be published\u0026lsquoWe\u0026rsquore being asked to sign up to a scheme when we don\u0026rsquot know the details,\u0026rsquo Lorraine Walsh saysTruck drivers Tomasz Wasowicz and Marcin Skrzpezyk deny 2017 murder of Ludowit PasztorSr Anne Marie happy to dedicate her life to praying and discerning the Will of GodDepartment of Agriculture issues gorse fire warning as temperatures to hit 20 degreesMove sparked by killing of Clodagh Hawe and her three sons by her husband Alan in Cavan in 2016Stud farm of Andrew Lloyd Webber says treatment of thoroughbred it once owned \u0026lsquoterribly sad\u0026rsquoMore than \u0026euro800,000 spent on getting names on Irish roll may have been in vainTaoiseach wrote to tech executive pledging to help social media giant \u0026lsquorealise your plans\u0026rsquoTop-ups to take-home income likely to be made in form of increased allowancesCash problems blamed for failure to buy enough carbon credits to cover pollutionShared sports anthem for Northern Ireland proposed by Ulster University reviewDepartment of Health pledges it will not delay in dealing with \u0026euro5m ex-gratia schemeProtestants welcome within organisation, says GAA president John Horan"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3891768.1557823223!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new zealand woman joins nuns in cork and takes vow of silence","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Sister Anne Marie   after making a public profession of vows as a Carmelite nun at the Holy Family Carmelite Hermitage, Leap, Co Cork.

Photograph: Michael Mac Sweeney ProvisionA New Zealand woman has become just the second person to join an order of nuns who maintain a vow of silence and live as hermits in west Cork. Sr Anne Marie (20), formerly Hannah Loeman, professed her vows of obedience, chastity and poverty on Monday to become a Carmelite Nun of the Holy Face of Jesus.Before a congregation of about 25 people at the Holy Family Carmelite Hermitage in Leap in west Cork, Sr Anne Marie professed her vows before Tridentine priest, Fr Thomas Le Gal and her fellow nun, Mother Irene. Mother Irene has spent almost 30 years living as a consecrated hermit. “I arrived here from New Zealand in March 2017 and in September 2017, I received the habit as a novice and today I have made my first profession of vows for a period of three years,” said Sr Anne Marie, who will live in a wooden hut or cell.“I chose the order because they are devoted to our Lady and reading about the life of St Teresa and praying and discerning the will of God.”One of a large family from Whanganui on New Zealand’s North Island who were brought up with a strong Catholic faith, Sr Anne Marie admitted that she found adjusting to a life of silence and contemplation difficult at first, but she was now quite comfortable with it.“We are a silent order but one hour every day, we have recreation and can speak. We pray in common in Latin but when we pray in private, we have a choice of Latin or English but we only attend traditional Latin rite masses.“After professing today’s vows, I am obliged to remain for three years and at the end of that period of time if I am sure that it is not God’s will, I am free to leave or to make final vows for life to live as a Carmelite nun.”Mother Irene, who is originally from Dublin, said she spent time in the Carmelite order before becoming a hermit three decades ago.“I was approached by a priest to ask me if I would help a young lady in New Zealand who was searching for a traditional Carmelite community and could not find one, so he asked me to help her,” said Mother Irene.“I had some experience of the Carmelite way of life before I began living as hermit so I said, ‘Yes, if it’s God will she will stay and if it’s not God’s will, she will leave.’“ Sr Anne Marie is the first to join me here but we are hoping more will join us.”"},{"url":null,"title":"local","story":"Total of 62 candidates running in 32-seat constituencyTotal of 66 candidates running in 34-seat constituencyTotal of 49 candidates running in 20-seat

Photograph: Getty Images It says much about Northern Ireland that the continued existence of sectarianism is not in doubt instead the question, posed in report published today by Ulster University, is what should be done about it.“We now have to ask if the capability exists to provide solutions to these problems or whether we must simply hope that with the passage of time they will somehow just go away,” the report states.Sectarianism in Northern Ireland: A Review, by Prof Duncan Morrow, makes more than 50 recommendations – including the establishment of a specific government department to tackle sectarianism – which are based on extensive consultation with a range of sectors and on substantial analysis of statistical and other factors.In so doing, the report sheds fresh light on changing demographics in Northern Ireland and how future trends might affect not only the fluid nature of sectarianism, but also questions of national identity.Underpinning this is “a clear statistical trend towards a change in the religious minority-majority structure” of Northern Ireland and the “measurable trend towards a Catholic majority”.‘Majority rule’In this context, the 2011 census was a “demographic watershed”. For the first time, the proportion of the population declaring themselves as Protestant or brought up Protestant fell below 50 per cent: “In a society characterised by debates over ‘majority rule’, where consent by a majority underpins the legitimacy of the state, the absence of a religious majority is an important symbolic marker,” the report states.There are other changes: only two of the North’s six counties, Antrim and Down, now have “significant Protestant majorities”, and only one – Lisburn – of its five official cities.“Within a decade, Belfast will almost certainly have a Catholic majority,” it states in effect, a majority Protestant Northern Ireland “is now restricted to the suburban area surrounding Belfast.”This trend away from a Protestant majority “is likely to continue”. The main drivers of change are differing birth and death rates between the two communities, the effect of migration, and loss of affiliation, which is more pronounced in urban areas and in the east of Northern Ireland.Both Queen’s and Ulster University have a majority of students from a Catholic background conversely, 63 per cent of students who study in Britain do not return to Northern Ireland, and the report cites other studies which have suggested their numbers are disproportionately Protestant.The report warns about extrapolating too much from these trends. “Translating statistics about religious background into clear consequences for politics and national identity is never straightforward. Irish national identity“It is evident from the data over many years that very few Protestants consider themselves to have an Irish national identity and that the vast majority of those who call themselves Irish also identify as Catholic.”It also highlights a “significant growth” in the number of people calling themselves “Northern Irish” “as a distinct identity” and this is appears to be “shared to a significant degree” across the population.“What is not yet clear is the extent to which ‘Northern Irish’ is a stable or shared category.”In Belfast, the changes are “striking”: the report describes it as a “shared city, where the Catholic population is younger and more confident.”This is particularly true in areas close to interfaces, and the report points out a difference in the profiles of Catholic and Protestant areas around the city’s so-called “peace walls”, even though both are among the most deprived in Northern Ireland. This is particularly true in areas close to interfaces, and the report points out a difference in the profiles of Catholic and Protestant areas around the city’s so-called “peace walls”, even though both are among the most deprived in Northern Ireland. ‘Community decline’“Catholic communities that are younger and poorer may experience restrictions on space andor availability of resources . . . older Protestant communities, which are losing residents, may experience a sense of community decline, dereliction and abandonment.”The report highlights the impact of the so-called “asymmetric dynamic” on politics: unionist politics, it says, often reflect the perception that Protestant areas face a reduction in the physical area of territorial control, the potentially expanding restriction of their area for community celebration regarding parades, flags and emblems, the perception of a growth in influence of feared enemies such as “republicans” and “dissidents” and a sense of cultural pessimism.By contrast, nationalist politicians “appear to be more optimistic about future prospects”. In the absence of fears of further cultural loss, concerns are mainly over housing issues and any continuing evidence of residual discrimination.In the context of demographic changes, the report states, “the narrative of ‘two sides of a wall may soon change into a narrative about growing and declining communities with different demands and real social impact”."},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

After a 15 minute surgery, the vast majority of patients will regain their sight.However barriers to treatment are significant. In many corners of the globe, the £28 operation represents a small fortune – if it is offered at all in local hospitals.  The coordinated approach to community health (Catch) programme, part-funded by the UK’s Department of International Development (DFID), has sought to close treatment gaps by tapping into existing networks established to eradicate trachoma.“Avoidable blindness could triple by 2050 unless efforts to improve eye health-care are stepped up across the world,” Moses Chege, Sightsavers project director for Catch, told The .Disease of thorns | The battle to eliminate trachoma“Catch used innovative ways of improving this eye health-care, by piggybacking on trachoma camps to identify and treat people with other conditions,” he added.The fight against the so-called “disease of thorns” – which turns eyelashes against the globe of the eye and slowly blinds – has been ongoing for decades. Trachoma screening camps established by organisations such as Sightsavers across East Africa, where the disease was endemic, have had considerable success.But thousands of those who went in search of help did not receive treatment, as the trachoma camps were not equipped to tackle the eye conditions they were suffering from.The £5 million Catch programme, funded through the UK government’s aid match scheme, has addressed these gaps in eye care.Between 2014 and 2018, more than 64,600 cases of bacterial conjunctivitis were treated and 28,400 pairs of glasses were provided within the camps.Gladys Atto with patient Loumo Mariam, after performing sight-saving surgeryA further 21,000 people with cataracts who had surgery, having been provided with transport to their nearest hospital facility.“My life has totally changed,” said Loumo Mariam, who had cataract operation last year. “I can now move, look for water, for food. They will say I was half dead, but now I have risen back to life.”In her 60s, Loumo is from a small village in north-west Uganda. After a diagnosis at a trachoma camp in her village she was taken to hospital, completing the hours-long journey with 16 other patients.Her surgery was completed by Gladys Atto, a new ophthalmologist. It costs in the region of £20,000 to train a specialist eye doctor, and Dr Atto is one of 30 funded by Catch.Gladys Atto performing a cataract operation at at Moroto Regional Referral Hospital, North UgandaSome 650 existing health workers also received additional training in eye care - skills desperately required.The 30-year-old can perform as many as 30 cataract operations each day.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleBut as targets to eliminate trachoma are neared and the screening camps no longer required, the Catch project will have to adapt again. Sightsavers say the lessons learned will play a major part in further improving eye care in some of the world’s most remote communities.“It has also strengthened health systems so that this important work can continue,” he added.Sightsavers are currently raising funds for the \u0027End is in Sight\u0027 appeal.

His e went 52 feet (16 meters) lower than the previous deepest descent in the trench in 1960.Mr Vescovo found undiscovered species as he visited places no human had gone before. On one occasion he spent four hours on the floor of the trench, viewing sea life ranging from shrimp-like anthropods with long legs and antennae to translucent sea pigs similar to a sea cucumber.He also saw angular metal or plastic objects, one with writing on it.It was very disappointing to see obvious human contamination of the deepest point in the ocean, Mr Vescovo told Reuters.An object described as \u0026#34manmade\u0026#34 is illuminated at top right by the light of the submarine DSV Limiting Factor in the Pacific Ocean\u0026#39s Mariana TrenchPlastic waste has reached epidemic proportions in the world\u0027s oceans with an estimated 100 million tonnes dumped there to date, according to the United Nations. Scientists have found large amounts of micro plastic in the guts of deep-dwelling ocean mammals like whales.A report published on Tuesday, one of the first to document the impact of discarded plastic on the health of the poorest people in the world, estimates that between 400,000 and one million people die every year because of diseases and accidents linked to poorly managed waste in developing countries.Mr Vescovo hoped his discovery of rubbish in the Mariana Trench would raise awareness about dumping in the oceans and pressure governments to better enforce existing regulations, or put new ones in place.It\u0027s not a big garbage collection pool, even though it\u0027s treated as such, Mr Vescovo said of the worlds\u0027 oceans.Undersea explorer Victor Vescovo pilots the submarine DSV Limiting Factor in the Pacific Ocean\u0026#39s Mariana TrenchHis discovery comes a year after a study revealed how human activities were affecting deep-sea ecosystems.Scientists from the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology in Yokosuka found a plastic bag while exploring the deep trench. Other waste found by the probe include metal, rubber, fishing gear, glass and various other man-made items.In the last three weeks, the expedition has made four es in the Mariana Trench in his submarine, DSV Limiting Factor, collecting biological and rock samples.Sea creatures swim around a part of a submersible lander, illuminated by the light of the submarine DSV Limiting Factor on the floor of the Pacific Ocean\u0026#39s Mariana TrenchIt was the third time humans have ed to the deepest point in the ocean, known as Challenger Deep.

I\u0027ll still keep an eye out for those dragons. Do they wear suits?” Fantasy runs deep in New Zealand where children have grown up feasting on the terrible exploits of Glaurung the Great Worm and Ancalagon the Black in ‘Lord of the Rings’. Ms Ardern’s office has confirmed the correspondence with Victoria is genuine, but some aren’t sure. I\u0027ve seen enough \u0027cute interactionsreplies from famous people to children asking cute questions\u0027 posts to think this is a setup, wrote a user on Reddit.  “I can vouch for it being real since my 13-year-old sister got a very similar response from Jacinda\u0027s office last year, replied user CnHackett.Last year, New Zealand’s Labour leader revealed some of the more unusual letters she’s received.  One seven-year-old clearly thought that her powers had no limits.  Dear Jacinda, can you change the boring grey toasters into bright colours. Perhaps you could pass a law? the child asked.   In April, Ms Ardern said she helped a woman who had forgotten her wallet pay for her groceries at a supermarket “because she was a mother.”Globally admired for her empathetic response to the Christchurch mosques shootings in March, Prime Minister Ardern does have her critics.“The deification of Jacinda Ardern is underpinned by an extraordinary selectiveness when it comes to assessing the real political person, wrote  Judith Sloan, a Melbourne-based economist, in The Australian newspaper.  “On many fronts, her performance has been ordinary.”Brexit latest news: Cabinet ministers to urge Theresa May to abandon Labour talks as she wargames \u0026#39definitive votes\u0026#39Alesha MacPhail\u0026#39s killer Aaron Campbell granted an appeal against his 27-year sentenceMan known as \u0026#39Nick\u0026#39 invented \u0026#39most heinous\u0026#39 sex abuse allegations against dozens of politicians, court hearsComment: Nigel Farage has so many people he can thank for helping him come back with a bangRemain voters will back The Brexit Party at European elections, claims Nigel FarageComment: Bad news Brexiteers, your idea that Ireland will be next to leave the EU is a load of nonsenseDisney makes special Winnie-the-Pooh animation to celebrate royal baby Archie birthMental Health Awareness Week: The charts that show that the UK is in the midst of a mental health awakeningTrump\u0026#39s attorney general assigns prosecutor to investigate \u0026#39origin\u0026#39 of Russia investigationRamadan 2019: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranFive protesters and army major shot dead in Sudan protests as ousted president Bashir charged over crackdown US and Russia to discuss fate of Venezuela amid reports Putin will not prop up MaduroCalifornia jury orders Monsanto to pay $2 billion damages to a couple who got cancer from Roundup weedkillerComment: Lauren Laverne is not nosy enough to get to the unexpected emotional truths\u0026#39You could never take your eyes off her\u0026#39: the genius of Margot FonteynJeremy Kyle taken off air indefinitely after guest found dead a week \u0026#39after taking lie-detector test\u0026#39 on showComment: We need an urgent global response to the plague of plasticThere are more offenders in organised crime groups than soldiers in the army, says top police chief Comment: Cometh the hour, cometh the man – it\u0026#39s time for the Tories to send for Boris Primary school exam stress is exacerbated by teachers who are \u0026#39manufacturing anxiety\u0026#39, says OfstedWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 14 may 2019","story":"A member of the Filipino indigenous tribe \u0027Igorot\u0027 clad in traditional costume casts his election ballot at a school used as a polling station in Baguio City, Mountain Province, northern Philippines.

If you don’t have an Apple TV box, you can still access the app on the latest Samsung TVs.\u0026nbspIn March, Apple revealed a new TV+ video subscription service at a star-studded event in Cupertino. The company said the service would be part of an updated Apple TV app on iPhone, iPad and Apple TV streaming box.\u0026nbspThat app has just gone live in over 100 countries, though the new programming from Apple won’t be a part of it until it launches in the autumn. But the app has been subtly –\u0026nbspthough comprehensively –\u0026nbspchanged.The TV app is what Apple wants to be your first port of call for TV programming, and it already has neat features. One of the most useful is the Watch Now tab which keeps track of what you’ve been watching and finds the next stuff for you to see. When you’re halfway through an episode, it’ll keep track of where you are so you can pick up from that point, whether that’s on your Apple TV or iPad, for instance.The updated app, which I’ve been trying and which looks very inviting, by the way, has had a new lick of digital paint, with more sections to choose from. The main design of a screen-filling image with tiles of the latest programmes or movies\u0026nbspremains, though those tiles are now widescreen instead of square for TV shows, and vertical posters for movies.More importantly, there’s now a range of recommendations which are personalised for the user based on what you’ve watched already, in a section now called For You.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Samsung will cancel orders of its Galaxy Fold phone at the end of May if the phone is not then ready for sale.

As they are added, many offer a free time-limited trial so you can be sure it’s a channel you want to watch.One useful feature is being able to download shows for offline watching, though it’s worth noting that Sky Q and Netflix already offer something similar.Speaking of Netflix, it’s not available within the TV app, though you can access the programming through the separate Netflix app. Amazon Prime Video, another rival, is part of the TV app and it’s true to say that the greater integration does help make the app a desirable destination. Especially since the Apple TV box’s universal search system scans programming from multiple sources. The multiple channels in the same app is one of the coolest features of the app, and is simple, intuitive and useful.iPhone owners can sue Apple over its apps, US Supreme Court decidesSaudi sisters call for \u0027inhuman\u0027 woman-monitoring app to be removedThere’s a new Kids section which aggregates suitable content into appealing sections so you can find programmes with your favourite characters, for example, more easily, though there are also isions by age appropriateness as well. Apple has staff who curate programmes, handpicking the best ones.\u0026nbspPerhaps the most striking change is that the Apple TV app is available on Samsung TVs now as well. It’s initially available on all 2019 Samsung smart TVs and some models from last year. If your Samsung TV has AirPlay 2 compatibility –\u0026nbspthat’s the video streaming system Apple uses –\u0026nbspyou can also play content directly from your iPad, say, to the TV. This was previously only possible via an Apple TV box before.Other TV brands including LG and Sony will follow later in the year.Channels you subscribe to are accessible to everyone in your family at no extra cost, so you can watch one thing on your telly while another family member consumes content simultaneously on their iPhone or iPad, for instance. This applies for up to six family members and subscriptions are shared via Apple ID and password.The TV app was already a seamless way to watch most of your programming, whether through purchased movies or catch-up services. Now, it’s more snazzily designed and the convenience of doing everything from within the app is better still.Adding TVs from other companies, and later streaming boxes from Amazon, for example, may affect sales of the Apple TV streaming box, but the added familiarity of an app that is largely the same on multiple platforms is a neat way to make the TV app a convenient destination.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Andy Martin meets one of the brains behind the projectClick to followThe IndependentStark raised thousands of pounds for his firm through public initiatives and private donationsAs a schoolboy, Adam Stark was torn between being a musician and a computer scientist. So while he was supposed to be studying IT at Queen Mary University\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspLondon, he was mainly moonlighting on bass guitar and keyboards in a band called Munro Fox. But he also did a bit of producing and engineering on the side. By the time he graduated and embarked on a PhD, there had been a convergence between his academic work and his “first love”. The subject of his dissertation was Musicians and Machines: Bridging the Semantic Gap in Live Performance.“It made perfect sense,” he says when we meet in the cafe at the British Library in London. “I had been studying the mathematical relation of the harmonic series. The problem was how to make machines more sensitive.” Stark is 36 now, managing director of MI.MU\u0026nbsp(pronounced Me-Mew), and has come up with the most musically sensitive glove in the history of the world.Music is now, inescapably, music tech. Computers are an integral part of music production. “But,” says Stark, “they are still stupid: they don’t understand changes in tempo.” His dream is to get a computer tapping its foot in time to the music. “Why can’t I play a G chord and the computer chimes in with me?” The idea of “machine musicianship” is not to turn musicians into clunky robots but to free them up and allow them to play with more soul and spontaneity.The MI.MU\u0026nbspglove may be the closest we have yet come to synchronising musician and machine. “I love going to gigs,” says Stark. “But when you see live performances of electronic music, it often looks as if they’re sending their emails.” A guy behind a box pressing buttons or twiddling knobs is never going to be as visceral or exciting as a drummer or a guitarist. The glove enables you to become a one-hand band. “It gives the electronic performer the same expressive power that acoustic musicians have.”We’ve always used our hands to communicate. With the advent of the glove, body language is now body music. But (a word of warning) you have to be a decent musician to start with. It’s not going to magically turn a clumsy wannabe into a virtuoso overnight.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Samsung will cancel orders of its Galaxy Fold phone at the end of May if the phone is not then ready for sale.

Then he saw a tweet from Imogen Heap seeking technical expertise for a project she had been working on. She wanted to do a live performance in her garden using a glove. “She needed something serious and professional, not a toy.” The seed had been planted by an opera singer who had used a glove, engineered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u0026nbspMedia\u0026nbspLab, to produce more vibrato. Gloves had also been used to control machinery. “But we had to start again from scratch,” says Stark. “They weren’t up to spec.”Stark pays tribute to all the people involved in the project. As well as musicians and techies (including Tom Mitchell of the University of the West of England in Bristol), they needed a textile specialist (Hannah Wilson) to make the gloves work and a designer (Rachel Freire) to bring style and flair and make them look and feel good. The summer of 2012 saw Imogen Heap performing a song, with the gloves, in a geodesic dome powered by the pedalling of massed cyclists in her back garden in Essex.Imogen Heap presents the glove to a summit in Lisbon last year (Getty)But that was just the start. They had made something wonderful: an item of clothing that controlled music wearable tech, but fitted, bespoke, to just one inidual artist. It was hugely over-designed and expensive. The point was to make one that worked potentially for anyone. That’s when MI.MU\u0026nbspwas born with a mission to “enable people to express themselves through tech”. The name means Me-Music, ie you are personalising the music you play, shaping it – with the movements of your own body – to give form to your mood and thoughts and personality.At the beginning, you needed a backpack, loaded with technical kit, wired to the gloves, and a team of people standing in the wings to make it work. Now, after years of research and development, the glove really is just a very streamlined, sinuous-looking glove, connected to a computer via bluetooth. Numerous artists, including Ariana Grande on her 2015 world tour, have road-tested them. And now they’re available to pre-order online direct from MI.MU\u0026nbspat £2,500 per pair (you can buy one at half the price).Harry Potter composer invents pair of gloves that makes musicBut what impressed me was Stark’s ability to drum up funding to keep the whole show on the road for years before the product could go on sale. Inidual musicians who believed in the concept chipped in thousands of pounds. But Stark was also able to win a number of grants, from Innovate UK (funded by the government) and an EU source, Horizon 2020. The company still had to finesse the sensors that were capable of recognising postures and measuring the bend of a finger or the orientation of a wrist. Are you clenching your fist? Pinching your fingers? The glove needs to know.Wearing these gloves is cool in a\u0026nbspway that holding a white stick\u0026nbspis notThe gloves are made of 60 per cent\u0026nbsprecycled fabric. MI.MU\u0026nbspuses\u0026nbspCarvico vita, a high performance sports fabric, and Yulex, a sustainable, plant-based alternative to neoprene. And they are produced in Leicester by Sew Systems, who helped them develop fabric bonding in place of stitching.The glove can be used by dancers and actors as well as musicians:\u0026nbsp“They’ve got the movement, now we can do the sound.” But Stark reckons that\u0026nbsp“gesture-based” tech\u0026nbsphas other potential uses. He foresees MI.MU-gloved surgeons carrying out remote operations in far-flung parts of the world via Skype. Meanwhile, he is still heading up a long-running musical project called Rumour Cubes\u0026nbspand there is talk of his old band, Munro Fox, reforming. At least they won’t need a huge vehicle to lug all their kit around. All they have to do is snap their fingers.View from the TopQueen Mary University of LondonOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It wants to remove six directors and replace them with seven of its own nominees\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentTransPennine Express: One of FirstGroup\u0027s rail franchises Transport company FirstGroup’s response to its biggest shareholder trying to seize control of the board was to politely tell it to get off the bus.\u0026nbspCoast Capital Management, a US activist investor, has gobbled up a near ten per cent stake in the company, which operates the Great Western, South Western and TransPennine ­Express rail franchises, and has bus business both here and in\u0026nbspthe US.\u0026nbspIt’s less than impressed with FirstGroup’s strategy and its fending off a takeover approach last year and wants to replace six of the current eleven Directors - including chief executive Matthew Gregory and chairman Wolfhart Hauser - with seven of its own nominees. \u0026nbspFirstGroup\u0027s £68m West Country deal on track until 2019A website is, we are told, planned which will list the group’s failings. Prominent among them will be its continued interests in rail franchises, which Coastal doesn’t think are worth having. But that’ll likely be just the starter for ten. \u0026nbspFirst certainly has some questions to answer.It’s shares were in a trough before Coast started agitating, and it’s been losing money if you look at the raw numbers rather than the adjusted ones the company would prefer people concentrated on. It lost a CEO last year and the rail business is beset with uncertainties, with the government wanting operators to take responsibility for a wonky pension and a review into the future of the industry\u0026nbspunder way.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGiven that it was commissioned by a Department for Transport run by Calamity Chris Grayling, it’s understandable why investors might be worried about First’s continued involvement in the sector, notwithstanding its arguments about the handsome returns that it has made from it.\u0026nbspThing is, there is a route for Coastal to achieve what it wants\u0026nbspwithout the need for EGMs, boardroom coups, or websites listing grievances. It could table a takeover bid after which it would be free to appoint whomever it wanted to run the thing and implement its strategy.Of course, that would involve the outfit buying out all the other shareholders at a premium and\u0026nbspCoast\u0026nbspdoesn’t want to do that, hence all the noise\u0026nbsp(this sort of thing is great fun for those of us in the media).\u0026nbspDirectors are, of course, charged with acting in the interests of all shareholders. But don’t kid yourself. Coast\u0026nbspCapital’s attempt to get it\u0027s nominees on to\u0026nbspthe board is about getting control on the cheap, and then getting out quick with a nice return when the show\u0027s over.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

This morning the bank sought to stop the rot\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent Bank has sought to reassure investors and customers that all is well with the institution“Meet the new bankers, same as the old bankers.”That was The Independent’s headline at the top of a piece I wrote back in 2016, having delved into the backgrounds of the bosses of the challenger banks the government hoped would shake up Britain’s moribund banking industry. More than half of them were linked through having worked for Fred Goodwin’s Royal Bank of Scotland, which ended up nearly breaking the UK economy.\u0026nbspGiven the rash of negative stories about  Bank (its boss Craig Donaldson is one of the RBS alumni who were featured in that story), would that headline today read\u0026nbsp“meet the new banks, same as the old banks”?\u0026nbsp Bank reassures customers’ their money safe after WhatsApp rumour Bank should not let recent failures alter its course Bank and Starling get millions from RBS competition fundThere was even, over the weekend, an incidence of people queuing to withdraw cash in west London, which brought back uncomfortable memories of a certain Northern Rock.\u0026nbspFor goodness sake, calm down, said the bank this morning, in response to some of the wild rumours flying around social media. We’re not even close to being in the sort of situation the Rock was in. Yes, we’re raising £350m from our investors, but it’s to finance growth, not to bail us out and it’s going well. We’ll complete before the end of June. So move along, there really is nothing to see here.\u0026nbspThe trouble for  is that it created a rod for its own back when it had to admit that it had messed up with the risk classification of some of its loans for regulatory purposes – a big no no – and reported some disappointing results at the start of the year.\u0026nbspThe shares behaved as if they’d taken a right to the nose from Canelo\u0026nbspAlvarez. They’ve been rolling around on the floor ever since. Shorting the stock has been a favoured tactic of hedge fund managers with their eyes on new yachts. In the space of not much more than a year, a stock that had reached the giddy heights of £35 has fallen back to just over £5. It was on the slide again this morning.\u0026nbspThe world outside London’s financial centre has taken note of this. It has only added fuel to the brush fires that Donaldson and his team are now trying to put out.\u0026nbspThey’ve pointed to the awards  has been winning for customer service, the fact that it’s opening branches when others are closing them, the profits it has declared.Your money is safe, and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme covers you up to £85,000 anyway, has been the message.\u0026nbspProblem is, bitter past experience tells people there’s no smoke without fire and logic says that if they’re worried it’s safer to get out. Even though depositor protection has markedly improved since the Rock hit the rocks, getting compensation takes time and causes inconvenience and worry.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

No jobs cuts are expected prior to that date.Director of Honda UK Jason Smith\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbsp“It is with a heavy heart that today we confirm the closure of Honda’s factory in Swindon. We understand the impact this decision has on our associates, suppliers and the wider community. We are committed to continuing to support them throughout the next phases of the consultation process.”The Japanese carmaker had announced plans in February to leave the site in South Marston near Swindon. It said the change was not as a result of Brexit but because it is shifting focus to electric cars with most demand expected to be in Asia.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersAfter consulting\u0026nbspwith the government and external consultants engaged by the Unite union, closure was deemed to be inevitable.Prime Minister Theresa May’s official spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “Clearly, this is a disappointing decision, despite the best efforts of local MPs, civic and business leaders and the trade unions since Honda’s initial announcement in February. We recognise this is a worrying time for affected employees, their families and businesses in the supply chain.”Business secretary Greg Clark has set up a local taskforce which\u0026nbspaims to ensure that\u0026nbspemployees are able to move on to new skilled employment. That taskforce is due to hold its next meeting next week.Honda is one of a number of car manufacturers to cut back its presence in the UK this year. Nissan said in January that it would build its new X-Trail model in Japan instead of Sunderland, despite earlier reassurances.Ford is planning to offer redundancy to more than 500 staff at its Essex office, while Jaguar Land Rover confirmed in January that it would cut 4,500 jobs from its 40,000-strong UK workforce as it attempts to deal with a sharp drop in demand in China.I can’t blame Honda for leaving, this country keeps letting them downUnite national officer for automotive industries\u0026nbspDes Quinn said he believed there was a case for keeping the plant open and that the government would have provided public funding.“It would have made Honda a global leader in emerging battery technology and in a strong position to exploit the growing global market for electric vehicles in the coming years,” Mr Quinn said.“Instead we have this body blow which is nothing short of a betrayal of the workforce, customers and the wider supply chain which relies on Honda Swindon for work.“Unite can only conclude that Honda is taking a strategic decision to retreat out of Europe in favour of protecting its North American operations and avoiding president Trump’s tariff threat on cars made in Europe.”Honda said it was closing\u0026nbspthe Swindon factory as part of a broader global strategy “in response to changes to the automotive industry”.The company also faces the reality of uncertain tariffs on vehicle exports from the UK after Brexit. Meanwhile, Japan and the EU recently finalised a trade deal that will see tariffs on Japanese vehicles imported into the trading bloc reduced from 10 per cent\u0026nbspto zero.In a statement on Monday, Honda said: “As previously communicated in February, Honda is accelerating its electrification plans, and as a result resources, capabilities and production systems for electrified vehicles will be focused in regions with a high volume of customer demand.“This concludes the first phase of the collective consultation process. The second phase – which includes agreeing associate redundancy packages and identifying the impact on inidual roles up until production ceases in 2021 – will begin immediately.“Honda will also intensify its engagement with the Swindon taskforce set up by secretary of state Greg Clark, in order to work with government and a broad range of stakeholders to mitigate the impact of this decision on the wider community.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Details of the fundraising are expected to be revealed this week.The new funds are to cover an\u0026nbspaccounting error that saw the bank underestimate the amount of cash it needed to hold to cover the risk some of its loans.Despite the assurances  Bank’s share price dropped as much as 9 per cent on Monday before recovering to trade 5 per cent down. Bank should not let recent failures alter its courseIn an interview with the Financial Times, chief executive Craig Donaldson revealed that  Bank is looking at selling\u0026nbsp£1bn worth of loans at the centre of the problems.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell said: “Having hundreds of customers queue up to withdraw money certainly hasn’t helped matters, particularly as the business is in the process of trying to raise £350m to alleviate concerns about its balance sheet.“Chatter on social media that customers’ money wasn’t safe spiralled out of control at the weekend, with memories of the run on Northern Rock in 2007 still in many people’s minds.”Pre-tax profits slumped to £6.9m in the first quarter from £10m a year ago, while shareholders have also been urged to vote against the re-election of chairman Vernon Hill.Mr Hill has come under fire for the accounting blunder and for millions of pounds of company money paid to his wife’s architecture firm InterArchMichael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: “It is highly probable that shareholders will insist on some management changes as a quid pro quo for any new capital, with chairman Vernon Hill, as well as chief executive Craig Donaldson, in the firing line of some investors, on the back of a share price e from £35 12 months ago to under £5 now.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It prompts often-unnecessary fear and distress from some of the millions who receive it.\u0026nbspAnd worse, as it’s a gateway document, this reverberates across society, and therefore risks wrongly deterring many from a future of higher education.”The report, which calls for the current student loan statement to be redesigned, will be presented to the government and to Philip Augar, who is leading the review of post-18 education and funding.National deficit rises by £12bn in change to student loan accountingAmatey Doku, vice president higher education at\u0026nbspNational Union of Students (NUS), welcomed “a clearer, more detailed student loan statement” and calls for it to be more difficult to change loan repayment terms.But he warned: This report must not be used to suggest that students and graduates endorse the current funding system even if they would welcome clearer information, and improved loan statement should not be a Trojan horse to rebrand loans as a ‘graduate contribution scheme’ if their underlying mechanics remain the same.It would be more misleading to students and the public to downplay student loan arrangements which result in the poorest graduating with higher debts than the richest, and where the repayment system is flawed and regressive.\u0026nbspWe must start with a fundamental redesign of student finance, not its resulting paperwork.”A Department for Education (DfE) spokesperson said they welcomed the contribution to the government’s review of post-18 education and funding – which includes “looking at how information about student finance can be communicated as clearly as possible to borrowers.”They added: “Student loan statements are currently issued annually, setting out the balance, repayments and interest for borrowers but we are continually working to improve the repayment system.\u0026nbspWe are exploring how students taking out a student loan can have better access to much more up-to-date information on their repayments.”A Student Loans Company (SLC) spokesperson said they were working towards making more repayment information available to customers online.They added: “We are already engaged with customers to explore how best to present repayment information and always welcome discussion on how to make our communications transparent.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The final is on 18 May.Madonna\u0027s appearance was announced by her publicists last month, when it was said she would play two songs during the interview – one from her forthcoming album Madame X, and another from her back catalogue.Madonna will arrive in Tel Aviv to start rehearsals on Wednesday.

In an era when extravagance had well and truly taken hold, the staging was notably bare. The orchestra, the belting, the key changes, and the five backing singers dressed as a cross between beauty queens and security guards all make this feel like the climax of a modern opera. Has Eurovision ever seen anything like it, before or since? Finland’s first win after 45 years of participating came at the hands of a heavy metal band dressed in monster costumes – but this ranking is not based on novelty alone. Behind the growled vocals and pyrotechnics, “Hard Rock Hallelujah” is a pretty great song – even for those who ordinarily can’t stand this kind of thing. The backing vocals on the chorus are a particular high. It also provided a welcome departure from the high-octane pop-fest that many believe Eurovision to be. The jewel in the crown of Ireland’s seven wins is this corker from Logan, who returned looking every inch the matinee idol in his pristine white suit. It’s the kind of big power ballad that fist-clenching was made for, and his big build on “I will always love you” should win another prize for the most ambitious key change.One of Sweden’s most popular entries, Carola is winning from the moment she bounds on stage and lets out that first “Woah-oh-oh!”. Her voice is flawless, the key changes are great, and who doesn’t appreciate a wind machine? Another slice of Scandi pop perfection.A high energy pop song with colourful young performers and fun choreography – “Making Your Mind Up” is the stuff that Eurovision is made of. The famous moment when the boys ripped off the girls’ skirts only to reveal shorter skirts beneath them is one of the competition’s most famous moments. A number one hit record across Europe that year, the song remains as infectious today as ever.Celine Dion was just 20 years old when she came to international attention with this performance. The song itself is excellent – a French chanson worthy of Edith Piaf, with a slightly twee drum machine stepping up the beat for a bop of a chorus. This all took place before Celine was transformed into an ageless power ballad queen (see the pageant-esque hair and outfit), but it’s thrilling to hear how her vocals were sheer perfection even then. Oh, and the arm choreography was well on its way too.710 4. “Love Shine a Light” – Katrina and the Waves (United Kingdom, 1997) The beautiful fusion of hammond organ, tambourines, hand clapping and the quasi-spiritual lyrics themselves make this feel like a glorious hymn – and Katrina really takes it to church. One of the highest scorers in modern times, this was the last time the UK won the competition, and it came the day after Labour’s landslide 1997 election victory. What a time to be alive.Conchita’s performance had everything you could want in a Eurovision performance. Elegant and fierce all at once, “Rise Like a Phoenix” could match the finest Bond theme, and is easily one of the most timeless of all the winners. The big band adds to the glamour of it all, and brings the goosebumps on that dramatic orchestral rise towards the final chorus. It was a powerful moment for LGBT+ visibility, too the song’s theme of triumph over adversity secured it as an anthem for life’s survivors.It’s hard to pick any other recent winner that comes as close to contemporary chart toppers as “Euphoria” – a dance hit that many contemporary pop stars would kill for. Written by Sweden’s Thomas G:son – who has produced more than 90 songs for Eurovision competitors across multiple countries – “Euphoria” is built on clever pop formulas. The chorus itself is anthemic perfection, but when Loreen tacks on: “We’re going up, up, up...” it strikes gold. The Kate Bush-esque performance was an added bonus.ABBA burst onto the stage at the 1974 competition, kickstarting Sweden’s international reputation as masters of pop. Early adopters of the kind of kitsch which would come to typify the show, ABBA used their platform to offer a taste of the cultural phenomenon they would go on to become. From the opening piano build to the switch between a minor bridge and major chorus, to the catchy hooks littered throughout, “Waterloo” is a masterclass in how to write a hit, and the song rightly went on to become one of the best-selling singles of all time. ABBA continue to influence Eurovision contestants to this day, and while you may have another favourite, “Waterloo” is a song on which most people can agree is a solid gold classic. We promise to love you forever more.Let’s get down to business. Making their debut at Eurovision, Serbia later romped home as champions with this high-drama ballad.

It’s the clearest example of how rushed the show has become in recent years, as its unpredictability gives way to conventional plot. 271 70. Season four, episode three: Breaker of ChainsJaime appears to rape Cersei next to Joffrey’s corpse. The scene is confused, unpleasant and different from the books in confusing and unhelpful ways. The Sand Snakes are just unbearably naff and this is one of their worst.At Craster’s Keep, much rape and murder of children. Unpleasant. The opposite of the rushed plot of the later seasons, this is basically a leisurely chat up the M1. 671 66. The Last of the StarksGiven a chance to return to real intrigue after the Battle of Winterfell, Benioff and Weiss showed they had lost their grip, with an incoherent episode that betrayed several key characters for the sake of obvious plot grinding. A Starbucks cup left on a feasting table told us everything we needed to know about a series that has given up.771 65. Season two, episode eight: Prince of WinterfellThere is some good stuff with Arya and Jaqen H’ghar, but it’s mainly placeholder as they set up the Battle of Blackwater. Jon Snow and Ygritte’s goodbye at the climax of season three ought to have been much sadder. 971 63. Season five, episode two: The House of Black and WhiteLots of setting up. Jaime and Bronn plan to go to Dorne, Arya arrives in Braavos. 1071 62. Season seven, episode six: Beyond the WallThis ought to have been one of the great battles: ice zombies plus dragons plus Jon Snow’s expedition. It looked spectacular, but everyone worried about teleporting ravens and speed of sound dragons. Some absolutely horrible banter between Grey Worm and Missandei.Pyat Pree kills the 13 in Qarth. Tywin talks to Arya about legacy.Melisandre is a very, very old woman. Lots of Tyrion talking in King’s Landing but not much else. The Hound meets Ian McShane. That’s about it in an episode full of preparations.A classic season opener that flits from place to place. 1771 55. Season two, episode four: Garden of BonesLots of grimness. Rat and bucket torture at Harrenhal. Robb Stark meets Talisa. Joffrey is cruel to Ros and Daisy. 1871 54. Season five, episode one: The Wars to ComeMance Rayder refuses to bend the knee, is burned at the stake by Stannis before Jon shoots him with an arrow. A pretty good death actually. 1971 53. Season five, episode five: Kill the BoySeason five is perhaps the weakest, and this is one of the weakest episodes in it, despite some good Bolton action and the Stone Men’s fateful attack on Tyrion and Jorah Mormont as they sailed through Valyria. In the season two opener we meet Stannis at Dragonstone, and then Joffrey orders a tremendous infanticide. It was vaguely controversial at the time. Feels like a lifetime ago. ‘Power is power,’ Cersei tells Littlefinger, which was good.Jon Snow coming back to life really shouldn’t have felt flat. Yet it did. Understandable given that it had to build an entire medieval universe, but 12 major characters are introduced here. That’s too many major characters. 2371 49. Season six, epsidoe four: Book of the StrangerJon and Sansa reunite, which is cool, Daenerys burns some more enemies, which is hot, good High Sparrow monologue to Margaery. Theme of climbing. Thormund makes his way up the Wall Littlefinger gives his most famous monologue, as he explains to Varys that chaos is ‘a ladder’. 2571 47. Season five, episode two: Sons of the HarpyMid-season doldrums, particularly acute in five, as Jaime and Bronn arrive in Dorne.The same, basically, except for Tyrion meeting Daenerys. Everyone gives each other presents. Sluggish early-season number, although we meet Olenna and Margaery shows how skilful she will be at manipulating court. Until the later series, eight episodes are a bit hamstrung by setting up denouements to follow. This is true in season one, as the machinery creaks to set up the beheading they didn’t think could happen. 2971 43. Season three, episode seven: The Bear and the Maiden FairEven re-looking at what happened in this episode I still can’t really remember it, except for the fight with the bear. Oh yes, Mackenzie Crook! Forgot he was in this programme. 3071 42. Season two, episode five: The Ghost of HarrenhalTwo good moments: Renly is killed by the shadow, and Arya meets Jaqen H’ghar. 3171 41. Season eight, episode two: \u0027A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\u0027Another slow scene setter for the epic Battle of Winterfell, full of night-before antics including the knighting of Brienne by Jamie, and the slightly disturbing sight of Arya and Gendry preparing to go at it hammer and tongs.The demise of top lad Roose Bolton, as well as Balon Greyjoy, both sent to their ends by their families. Melisandre finally works her anti-death magic on Jon Snow. 3371 39. Season four, episode five: First of His NameOne of the good things about season four was that it was the only moment where, even briefly, it looked as though a kind of temporary stability had been achieved. Tommen is king, Sansa has escaped King’s Landing, Jon Snow and co get revenge on the mutineers at Craster’s Keep. The White Walkers attacking the Night’s Watch at the Fist of the First Men is a good laugh, but other than that there is a lot to get through, after the events of Blackwater in the previous episode, and the season two finale anticipates some of the rushed feeling that will occur later on. 3571 37. Season one, episode seven: You Win or You DieOur first real glimpse of what Cersei will become, as she outmanoeuvres Ned Stark after Robert Baratheon’s death in a hunting accident. A superb Arya moment, as she wipes out the rest of House Frey, but mainly this is set-up for a season that packs a lot in.3771 35. Season one, episode four: Cripples, Bastards and Broken ThingsNed working as policeman in Kings Landing to find out what happened to Jon Arryn. 3871 34. Season five, episode nine: Dance of DragonsOne of the most upsetting deaths in Game of Thrones, as Stannis Baratheon burns his friendly daughter Shireen alive to appease Melisandre. Theon jumping off the boat after Euron overruns the Greyjoy fleet. Nice reunion between Arya and Hot Pie. Tyrion talks Daenerys down from incinerating King’s Landing.A slower than expected opener for the final season, albeit with some touching reunions at Winterfell, especially Bran and Jamie seeing each other again.  4171 31. Season six, episode six: Blood of My BloodMidseasoner. Cersei sends Jaime to retake Riverrun, while Arya is finally trained as an assassin. Can’t really remember it, to be honest. 4271 30. Season one, episode five: The Wolf and the LionJaime and Ned have a brawl in the streets of King’s Landing in an episode that focuses on skulduggery rather than magic. If you ask me skulduggery always trumps magic. 4371 29. Season three, episode three: Walk of PunishmentThe first moment where a character’s trajectory was really reversed. We’d disliked Jaime since the start, but when his hand was chopped off he began to win us back. The Blackfish schooling Edmure at shooting fire arrows was another highlight. The opening of the fourth series introduced the charismatic, enigmatic Viper of Dorne, one of the few good things other than wine to come out of Dorne. Also notable for an excellent scene with Arya and the Hound clearing out an Inn.Introduces Margaery Tyrell and Brienne of Tarth, two of the best characters, and also sees Theon decide to betray Robb Stark. What is family? Who can you trust? Built around Sansa and Tyrion’s unwelcome wedding, while in the north there is a display of how important Sam will be as he draws on reserves of bravery to dragonglass a white walker. Littlefinger dumping Lysa out of the Eyrie is probably the most dramatic moment here, one of his decisive power-stealing moments as he saves Sansa. Can you remember a time before Game of Thrones? Re-watch ‘Winter is Coming’, marvel at the baby Starks, think on how many characters have died, reflect on your own mortality. You are much, much older than when Game of Thrones began. Your life is running between your fingers. Another dramatic death which is hard to remember now, as the miserable Viserys was put out of his grump with molten gold. 5071 22. Season two, episode six: Old Gods and the NewTheon takes Winterfell. Theon, you utter bastard. I hope you are punished for this.A key Littlefinger episode, as he continues to manipulate Sansa, while Jon Snow executes Janos and, in King’s Landing, Cersei’s machinations are matched by Margaery’s. 5271 20. Season four, episode two: The Lion and the RoseJoffrey, scratching at his throat, going purple, dying. Top stuff. 5371 19. Season four, episode six: The Laws of Gods and MenAn excellent mid-season episode, built around Tyrion’s trial but with lots of other things to admire that hint at the underlying economies in the Game of Thrones universe. Drogon barbecues some livestock, while the Iron Bank of Braavos refuses to bail out Davos and Stannis. The full depravity of Ramsay Bolton is laid bare as he taunts Theon with a fake escape, while Commander Mormont is murdered at Craster’s Keep. But really it’s all about Daenerys, as she and her pets flame Astapor to the ground.5571 17. Season seven, episode seven: The Dragon and the WolfIt turns out Jon Snow is actually the true heir to the Seven Kingdoms, the remaining Stark children finally team up to kill Littlefinger, admittedly in overwrought style, and the White Walkers use their new lizard hairdryer to destroy the wall. There is far too much going on, especially the odd scene where Jon shows Cersei the wight, but nevertheless it sends you reaching for the popcorn and cheering along, which is more or less where we are at with the whole series by now. 5671 16. Season three, episode five: Kissed by FireMost notable for Ygritte and Jon’s much-parodied love grotto scene, but also for the Hound’s duel with Bendric Dondarrion, which revealed his terror of fire. Nursing his stump in the baths, Jaime tells Brienne the truth about his assassination of the Mad King. Mid-seasoner. The denouement of the fifth series is the most sympathetic we ever see Cersei, as she completes her walk of atonement through the streets of King’s Landing, her hair cut and her clothes stripped. Strategically, humiliating Cersei proves not to be the masterstroke the High Sparrow thought it would be. 5871 14. Season seven, episode four: The Spoils of WarSpoils aplenty. Arya returns to Winterfell and sees Sansa, then fights a brief duel with Brienne that shows just how much she’s learnt. It’s nothing on one of the great shots of the whole series, however: Daenerys riding Drogon above a Dothraki horde in full charge before incinerating the Lannister lines. 5971 13. Season one, episode 10: Fire and BloodWe were promised dragons, and here they are, mewing atop the naked Daenerys. And one thing we know about baby dragons is they must grow up. This is Game of Thrones’ version of Chekhov’s rule about guns. You’ll keep watching until they torch something. As the big battles go, the showdown between the Night’s Watch and wildlings and the wights at Hardhome doesn’t quite match some of the others, but it is still dead cool, especially when Jon realises his sword works against the snowmen. If that wasn’t enough, Sansa also learnt that her family might be alive. 6171 11. Season four, episode nine: The Watchers on the WallThe big set-piece between the Night’s Watch and the wildlings. Not quite up to Blackwater’s standards, despite its battle specialist Neil Marshall being summonsed back to direct.  There is too much crammed into this episode, which could have been spread over several hours, but it’s wonderful stuff all the same. Jon meets Daenerys for the first time, Sam cures Jorah of greyscale, Cersei obliterates the Tyrells. Best of all is Diana Rigg, at a table in her tower, bowing out from what is perhaps Thrones’ best overall performance. Poor old Hodor. The death nobody wanted, as a wonderful character, played so sympathetically by Kristian Nairn, is finally given his due. 6471 8. Season four, episode eight: The Mountain and the ViperOther things happen: Littlefinger takes over the Vale, and the Boltons move into Winterfell, but the episode is mainly memorable for the central duel, as Oberyn seeks justice from the man who murdered so many of his relatives, and for one image above all, of the Mountain’s armoured fingers crushing Oberyn’s skull like a grapefruit. Poor old Ned Stark. The death they said could never happen! Clearly they had not watched enough Sean Bean films. After two scene-setting episodes, The Long Night finally delivers on the promise of season eight, with 90 minutes of marvellous blood and fire at Winterfell. The Night King’s hordes meet the assembled ranks of Westeros, wildlings, Dothraki and Unsullied. The defenders lose and lose and lose until they finally win, although not before a few spectacular deaths. If it lacks some of the strategic nuance of other battles, it compensates with stunning action sequences and CGI, especially on the dragons, who dogfight high above the plain.6771 5. Season six, episode 10: The Winds of WinterWinter has come. It opens with peak Cersei, as she eliminates all her remaining enemies in one enormous blaze. Arya kills Walder Frey. The Jon Theory is confirmed. Tommen walks out of the window. 6871 4. Season three, episode nine: Rains of CastemereThe Lannisters send their regards. Some would have this number one, and one could easily make the case. The Red Wedding was the scene that broke Game of Thrones out of its fandom and into broader popular culture, the point where it was no longer avoidable. Fury, anguish, love, surprise, pity, hate: it’s all here. The look Roose Bolton gives Catelyn Stark when she reveals the chainmail he is wearing to dinner might be my single favourite moment of the whole programme. 6971 3. Season six, episode nine: Battle of the BastardsAnyone who has seen Mel Gibson’s Mayan drama Apocalypto knows that running in a straight line away from arrows rarely works. So it proved for Rickon, setting up one of the great battles not only on TV but on any kind of film. Where in previous seasons battles had occasionally felt hampered by budget, most egregiously when Tyrion was knocked out and missed the whole thing, this was the full belt and braces. It was brilliantly directed, with aerial shots, as well as face-in-the-mud close-ups to convey the full grinding horror of the battle, and the grim relief of victory. The fourth season is the best all-round, I think, the high-point of character development before it started to be forced by the machinations of the plot in the later series. Brienne’s bloody brawl with the Hound leaves him bleeding and broken, as Arya heads off to Braavos. Tywin finally gets his comeuppance, a crossbow bolt on the loo, administered by his son, Tyrion, who then flees. And Stannis’s cavalry arrives to save Jon and defeat Mance Rayder and the wildlings in a pincer movement, having been persuaded by Davos. This is purely a personal view, but if Ned Stark’s death was the moment you sat up and paid attention, Blackwater was the where you started cheering at the TV. The scale, the splendour, the depth of character brought to bear on grand events: they all felt new, somehow. This might have been the last moment where we were equally rooting for both sides, except for one side to be consumed in an eerie green glow. Wildfire doesn’t care who your favourite character is. There has to be a loser. ‘Eastwatch’ throws away one of the most important pieces of information in the whole show, Jon’s true parentage, as well as lots of good reunions. It’s the clearest example of how rushed the show has become in recent years, as its unpredictability gives way to conventional plot. 271 70. Season four, episode three: Breaker of ChainsJaime appears to rape Cersei next to Joffrey’s corpse. The scene is confused, unpleasant and different from the books in confusing and unhelpful ways. The Sand Snakes are just unbearably naff and this is one of their worst.At Craster’s Keep, much rape and murder of children. Unpleasant. The opposite of the rushed plot of the later seasons, this is basically a leisurely chat up the M1. 671 66. The Last of the StarksGiven a chance to return to real intrigue after the Battle of Winterfell, Benioff and Weiss showed they had lost their grip, with an incoherent episode that betrayed several key characters for the sake of obvious plot grinding. A Starbucks cup left on a feasting table told us everything we needed to know about a series that has given up.771 65. Season two, episode eight: Prince of WinterfellThere is some good stuff with Arya and Jaqen H’ghar, but it’s mainly placeholder as they set up the Battle of Blackwater. Jon Snow and Ygritte’s goodbye at the climax of season three ought to have been much sadder. 971 63. Season five, episode two: The House of Black and WhiteLots of setting up. Jaime and Bronn plan to go to Dorne, Arya arrives in Braavos. 1071 62. Season seven, episode six: Beyond the WallThis ought to have been one of the great battles: ice zombies plus dragons plus Jon Snow’s expedition. It looked spectacular, but everyone worried about teleporting ravens and speed of sound dragons. Some absolutely horrible banter between Grey Worm and Missandei.Pyat Pree kills the 13 in Qarth. Tywin talks to Arya about legacy.Melisandre is a very, very old woman. Lots of Tyrion talking in King’s Landing but not much else. The Hound meets Ian McShane. That’s about it in an episode full of preparations.A classic season opener that flits from place to place. 1771 55. Season two, episode four: Garden of BonesLots of grimness. Rat and bucket torture at Harrenhal. Robb Stark meets Talisa. Joffrey is cruel to Ros and Daisy. 1871 54. Season five, episode one: The Wars to ComeMance Rayder refuses to bend the knee, is burned at the stake by Stannis before Jon shoots him with an arrow. A pretty good death actually. 1971 53.

Details of the fundraising are expected to be revealed this week.The new funds are to cover an\u0026nbspaccounting error that saw the bank underestimate the amount of cash it needed to hold to cover the risk some of its loans.Despite the assurances  Bank’s share price dropped as much as 9 per cent on Monday before recovering to trade 5 per cent down. Bank should not let recent failures alter its courseIn an interview with the Financial Times, chief executive Craig Donaldson revealed that  Bank is looking at selling\u0026nbsp£1bn worth of loans at the centre of the problems.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell said: “Having hundreds of customers queue up to withdraw money certainly hasn’t helped matters, particularly as the business is in the process of trying to raise £350m to alleviate concerns about its balance sheet.“Chatter on social media that customers’ money wasn’t safe spiralled out of control at the weekend, with memories of the run on Northern Rock in 2007 still in many people’s minds.”Pre-tax profits slumped to £6.9m in the first quarter from £10m a year ago, while shareholders have also been urged to vote against the re-election of chairman Vernon Hill.Mr Hill has come under fire for the accounting blunder and for millions of pounds of company money paid to his wife’s architecture firm InterArchMichael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: “It is highly probable that shareholders will insist on some management changes as a quid pro quo for any new capital, with chairman Vernon Hill, as well as chief executive Craig Donaldson, in the firing line of some investors, on the back of a share price e from £35 12 months ago to under £5 now.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That left it riven with cliffs called thrust faults, marked all over its surface.Now a new analysis, using data from Nasa missions, suggests that the Moon could still be shrinking today. As it does, it is experiencing moonquakes along those thrust faults, with the rock shaking at the\u0026nbspcliffs.Scientists compare the process to the way a grape will gradually wrinkle up, adding lines as it cools and shrinks. But unlike a grape\u0027s skin, the crust around the Moon cannot stretch and is instead brittle, making it break apart as the shrinking happens.The faults form when the crust moves around, and one part of the crust is pushed up over another. They form unusual-looking cliffs that can be seen from the surface, standing tall and many miles long.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

It helped shed new light on those moonquakes, including allowing for a better understanding of where they are actually coming from.Rock smashed into Moon during lunar eclipse and left huge craterOnce that location data was generated, it could be laid on top of the images of the thrust faults that were taken from a 2010 study that used pictures from Nasa\u0027s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.Comparing the two, they found that at least eight of the rumbles were coming from movement of plates beneath the Moon\u0027s surface, not from asteroid impacts or other explanations. That helped confirm that the Moon is still experiencing true tectonic activity, according to the new paper published in Nature Geoscience.The instruments left by Apollo astronauts in the past finished their work in 1977. But scientists think this shaking and shrinking is still happening to this day, with images seeming to show evidence of recent movement, such as boulders and landslides that appear to have recently fallen over.Nasa\u0027s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LROC NAC frame M190844037LR NASAGSFCArizona State UniversitySmithsonian)We found that a number of the quakes recorded in the Apollo data happened very close to the faults seen in the LRO imagery, said\u0026nbspNicholas Schmerr, an assistant professor of geology at the University of Maryland, in a statement.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s quite likely that the faults are still active today. You don\u0027t often get to see active tectonics anywhere but Earth, so it\u0027s very exciting to think these faults may still be producing moonquakes.The seismic data was taken from instruments that astronauts dropped onto the surface during Apollo missions. The one left by Apollo 11 died after a few weeks – but the rest kept measuring, eventually picking up 28 different, shallow moonquakes between\u0026nbsp1969 and 1977.Of those quakes, eight were picked up near to the faults that could be seen in images of the Moon\u0027s surface. That led them to conclude the two were connected.What\u0027s more, most of the shakes happened when the Moon was at the point of its orbit furthest away from the Earth. That happens because the stress from Earth\u0027s gravity disrupts its crust.We think it\u0027s very likely that these eight quakes were produced by faults slipping as stress built up when the lunar crust was compressed by global contraction and tidal forces, indicating that the Apollo seismometers recorded the shrinking moon and the moon is still tectonically active, said Thomas Watters, lead author of the research paper and senior scientist in the Center for Earth and Planetary Studies at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.Jeff Bezos wants to help Trump return the US to the moonWater just below surface of moon ejected by meteoroid strikesScientists now hope to return to the Moon and learn more about what is happening to it. The Trump administration has ordered Nasa to head back as soon as it can, and hopes to have astronauts back on its surface in five years.For me, these findings emphasize that we need to go back to the moon, Schmerr said. We learned a lot from the Apollo missions, but they really only scratched the surface. With a larger network of modern seismometers, we could make huge strides in our understanding of the moon\u0027s geology.This provides some very promising low-hanging fruit for science on a future mission to the moon.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Several reported that the screen flickered and froze after being folded and unfolded a number of times.In March Samsung claimed to have overcome any issues with the folding screen, releasing a video showing an elaborate testing process\u0026nbspto prove the durability of the new smartphone.According to the tech giant, a Galaxy Fold device could withstand 200,000 folds and unfolds - the equivalent of 100 folds per day for five years - without breaking.Samsung subjected the device to several rounds of extensive tests in its state-of-the-art reliability labs to make sure that the Galaxy Fold is ready to come to market, Samsung wrote in a blog post.\u0026nbspWhile the extent of the test may seem like overkill to some, Samsung viewed it as vital to ensuring the durability of the device\u0027s hinged design and Infinity Flex Display.Samsung is yet to provide an exact release date for the problematic phone, though DJ Koh\u0027s comments to The Korea Herald suggest it will be before the end of May deadline that the firm originally laid out to customers.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is incredibly rare to find sea life trapped in amber because the\u0026nbspfossilised resin is produced by\u0026nbspland-based trees.The find was a big surprise, Professor Bo Wang from\u0026nbspNanjing\u0026nbspInstitute of Geology and Palaeontology told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspWe never imagined we would find an ammonite in amber. This is the first record of ammonite in amber, and also the first marine macrofossil in amber.\u0026nbspAll the shells in the amber are empty and have no soft tissue, according to researchers at the institute\u0026nbspfrom the Chinese Academy of Sciences. They believe this proves\u0026nbspthe organisms were long dead by the time they were engulfed in the resin.NIGPAS)The outer shell of the ammonite is also broken and the entrance is full of sand. Scientists believe it would have washed up on a sandy beach covered with shells that was close to resin-producing trees.\u0026nbspThe sample also contains flying insects which were probably trapped by the resin as it was pouring out of the tree.As, the ammonite which is\u0026nbsp33mm\u0026nbsplong, 9.5mm wide,\u0026nbsp29mm\u0026nbsphigh and weighs 6.08g,\u0026nbspflowed down the trunk it trapped organisms near the foot of the tree and when it reached the beach it entombed the shells.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.New species of ancient human discovered - in pictures Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A foot bone of the newly discovered species Homo LuzonensisThe right upper teeth of the newly discovered species Homo LuzonensisThe teeth of newly discovered species Homo Luzonensis (L) are compared with those of the Homo ErectusThe excavation team at work in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandLuzon Island in the Philippines, where the discovery was madeThe excavation site in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandThe excavation site in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandA foot bone of the newly discovered species Homo LuzonensisThe right upper teeth of the newly discovered species Homo LuzonensisThe teeth of newly discovered species Homo Luzonensis (L) are compared with those of the Homo ErectusThe excavation team at work in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandLuzon Island in the Philippines, where the discovery was madeThe excavation site in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandThe excavation site in Callao Cave on Luzon IslandThe amber also contains other marine fauna such as sea snails and sea\u0026nbspslaters.\u0026nbspOf the terrestrial fauna found in the amber, mites are the most abundant, according to the paper\u0026nbsppublished in PNAS.\u0026nbspFossils of massive ‘lion’ larger than polar bear discovered in KenyaScientists enraged as T-Rex skeleton is put on eBay for £2.25mScientists used X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to obtain high-resolution images of the ammonite.It is the same as the X-ray examination in the hospital, but the resolution is much higher, Prof\u0026nbspWang said.\u0026nbspHe added: We took several thousands of images and combined them together to get a 3D photo. Micro-CT is also a non-destructive testing, so it does not destroy the amber.Researchers found the ammonite was a juvenile Puzosia (Bhimaites) living during the late Albian-early Cenomanian age. Its presence in the amber helped scientists date the deposit.It also shows that a\u0026nbspMyanman\u0026nbspamber forest existed\u0026nbspnear a dynamic coastal environment\u0026nbsp99-million-year-old.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But with a cunning twist of using some form of proportional voting to try to avoid all options being defeated, as happened last time.However, few in government believe they will find a way through, without Labour backing. One government source, asked what was the point, said simply: “We have tried everything else.”It all points to more stalemate, by a different route – and the prime minister being forced out this summer.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We are in a multipolar world without the assurance provided by unquestioned American dominance.”The only way to “defend Enlightenment values” was to invest in cyberwarfare and “the immense capabilities of artificial intelligence will transform the conduct of warfare”.Mr Hunt added: “Our aim, as ever, is to deter and avoid the horror of war in the knowledge that strength is the surest guarantee of peace.“The outcome of such investment should demonstrate beyond doubt that, when we say Britain stands for the defence of democratic values, when we promise never to leave our great ally, the United States, to perform this task alone, then we are as good as our word.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is clear that, once again, many people have been denied their say – indeed, many more than there were allegations of personation fraud in the whole of the UK last year.“This ‘show your papers’ policy presents an unprecedented risk to democratic access and equality. Possession of ID is not universal – with millions of people lacking the required forms of identification. If rolled out nationwide, mandatory voter ID could see tens of thousands of legitimate voters made voiceless.\u0026nbsp“Trust in our democratic system is vital – which is why ministerial scaremongering about fraud is especially dangerous.\u0026nbspMinisters must now focus on combatting the real threats to our democracy – rather than suppressing voters’ rights.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Donald Tusk tells Brussels to give us enough time for a second vote he is certain would overturn the first.They’re cocksure . . . they have done this so often where, after all. Yet they simply have no grasp of the rage among British voters — both Leavers and former Remainers are determined to uphold our democracy.That was the Government’s goal too once.

The worst effects can be mitigated. Many Remainer MPs still spread panic about it, knowing only that they are meant to.The new Tory leader must back No Deal, or use the genuine threat of it to improve Mrs May’s deal with the EU.It is indeed the party’s only chance.A MEASURE of how far our once great Parliament has sunk is that Labour MP Richard Burgon may soon run the justice system.Five years ago this thick Corbynista called Zionism, the right of Jews to their homeland, “the enemy of peace”. “I am proud to say,” he crowed, “I wouldn’t be a member of ‘Labour Friends of Israel’.”Then the spotlight fell on his party’s anti-Semitism. Burgon denied saying any of it, only for footage to turn up revealing he did. But the Shadow Justice Secretary insists his denials weren’t lies. He just forgot what he’d said.So that’s OK, then.Imagine our future under Corbyn’s prejudice-fuelled mob: With Marxists casually spitting out bile, making ­denials, then excuses.And this one would run our courts.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we must try to find a balance.The royals have long-established traditions and do not like change.But given how intense le is for new parents, who can blame Meghan and Harry for wanting to enjoy it alone for a bit Most women avoid cameras for weeks after giving birth. So having a photo taken, under pressure to look gorgeous, scrutinised from every angle, just a couple of days after giving birth  That is a huge ask.I didn’t get out of my pyjamas for a week both times after I had children.Harry and Meghan did a fantastic job introducing Archie to the world.I loved how Harry carried his baby in, already the hands-on father he wants to be, alight with the joy of new fatherhood.However, it was impossible not to think about how wonderful Diana would have been as a grandmother.The birth of a son must be bittersweet for Harry, knowing Diana will never meet Archie.While some grumbled about the two-day wait to show off the baby, others recommend a “babymoon” for parents to shut out the rest of the world and bond with their baby for a week or two.Something tells me that would have been Meghan and Harry’s preference, so this was a compromise.They understand they are public figures.Archie is seventh in line to the throne and his parents know that taxpayers, who in part pay their salary, expected to meet the baby at some point.Most of us only wish to send our love, wish the new parents well and share the moment with them.Within hours of the birth, Meghan’s half-sister had suggested the new arrival meant Meghan was morally obliged to reconnect with her father, Thomas Markle.Let’s be clear. Meghan doesn’t have to do any such thing.She is better off without a father she can’t trust.If your own family are not up to scratch, you make your own based on love, trust and happiness.Given how happy Meghan and Harry look with Archie, they are doing just fine with that.A couple of things really stood out for me about the way they introduced their baby to the world.First, didn’t Meghan look amazing in her Grace Wales Bonner-designed dress I love the fact she chose white, which clearly showed her post-baby bump.She knows what a role model is.And she knows better than to create unrealistic aspirations for women who have just given birth.After all, most mothers still have the bump for at least a few weeks after having a baby.Then there was the look of sheer happiness on the Queen’s face as she looked down at her new great-grandson.Even with her many children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, she radiated a delight she shares with grandmothers up and down the land.It was just beautul to behold.MAMMA mia! Looking at the cover of Sports Illustrated’s annual swimsuit issue – featuring model and entrepreneur Tyra Banks – it’s impossible to believe Tyra’s first cover was  years ago and she came out of “modelling retirement” for the shoot.The very idea of wearing a yellow string bikini – at any age, let alone  – is unimaginable to most of us mere mortals.Butyou’ve got it, flaunt it . . . and Tyra certainly still has it.I AM increasingly convinced the only way to grow old gracefully is simply to accept that it’s happening.So I feel bad for Katie Price, who at  had another facelt last month in Turkey.On Wednesday’s Good Morning Britain, the ex-model discussed her “addiction” to plastic surgery.She explained how she had her own fat injected under her eyes and had the side of her face “lted” in a bid to look more youthful.It sounds horric. Choosing to have serious surgery to look a bit younger is baffling.Maybe she feels defined by her looks and will do anything to hang on to them.When I look at pictures of Katie or watch her on TV, I wish she would be kinder to herself and love herself more.She should worry more about how she feels than how she looks.She needs a best friend – someone who knows everything about her and still loves her – to tell her to stop scratching the wrong itch.Katie should give up the plastic surgery and learn to love herself the way she are . . . wrinkles and all.NOT sure I’ll be taking up Lisa Snowdon’s tip for keeping an eye on how much she eats – using chopsticks for every meal instead of a kne and fork.The TV presenter, , says they slow down her eating, so she feels full more quickly.But whatyou are having soup I HAD a chuckle about the fact that Gregg Wallace’s favoured comment on his we Anne-Marie’s Instagram account is the suggestion that she print out a photo.Someone has compiled a mega-tweet of the many times he has commented on his -year-old partner’s photos, demanding she “print it”.When it comes to social media, that sort of defeats the object.Gregg, I feel for you. It’s hard getting older – and it sucks not understanding the modern way of doing things.WHEN Donald Trump refused to publish his tax s, I assumed it was because he didn’t want people to know how much money he had.It turns out it was because he had so little.His tax s reveal he “lost more money than almost any other American taxpayer for a decade, after his hotels and casinos racked up .BILLION dollars in losses”.So not quite the billionaire he claims he is . . .  or the ace businessman.PERHAPS the most surprising news of this week is that although more alcohol is now being drunk around the world, we Brits are not responsible for the rise.We call them snowflakes but, very often, the young people I meet are much more focused and impressive than my generation ever was.APPARENTLY it’s not just booze we Brits are giving up. Thanks to technology, we are now having less SEX than ever before, too.A major study found there has been a steep decline in rates of intimacy since , with fewer than half of Britons now having sex once a week.Scientists said that “le in the digital age” was partly to blame – with couples now too distracted by Netflix, social media or their phones to focus on each other.But seriously,you prefer Netflix or your phone to sex with your partner... well, it’s time for a orce, I’d say.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It means that, with discussions with my consultant, I can make decisions that help me and my family, and I can get on with living.The Health Secretary Matt Hancock has also backed the move, saying: Im a huge believer in improving the way we provide care for people through the smart use of technology.The best innovations are often brilliantly simple and Co-ordinate My Care is an example which shows the dference the NHS can make to peoples lives when they need it most.I want to see improvements across health and care, and more technology like this can help tailor healthcare to iniduals and help us fulfil the ambition of the NHS Long Term Plan to move to more person-first care.Patients can start their own CMC plan online, in their own time and in their own home.Once they have finished, they can book an appointment with their GP or nurse, who can add clinical details and upload the plan so that it can be shared with health professionals.Research on almost , CMC plans from London - the plan on which the new service is based - found that fewer than one in five people with a plan died in hospital.Around half of all deaths tend to occur in hospital.Professor Julia Riley, the clinical lead for CMC and palliative care consultant at the Royal Marsden, said: CMC came about after I saw the way in which my sister-in-law was cared for when she died.She wanted to die at home, but out-of-hours providers insisted she went to hospital.It would have been betterurgent care providers had known about her wishes in advance.That is why we developed CMC, which has helped thousands share their treatment wishes."},{"url":null,"title":"moment black humanoid figure descends from sky sending supernatural fans into a frenzy","story":"The video was shot in Burbank, Calornia and shows the object gently floating past the tree tops and then down to earth.In the video, the lit up front of a house comes into view as a mans voice can be heard.Setting his stall out early, he says “is that Jesus Christ ” before saying in Spanish “it’s a man”.“It went behind the tree and I can’t see it no more” he says as it disappears behind another tree for a second.At that stage, a clue as to what the strange “humanoid” figure might actually be emerges when the person says: “You don’t think that’s balloons do you ”.The video appears to have been uploaded to YouTube by someone called Pablo Morales, who insisted he “found no balloons or trash or anything that could have been that big”.One person who shared the video said he believed the figure was a Fallen Angel – presumably referring to the biblical idea of angels who have been expelled from heaven.“I believe that this could be a Fallen Angel as how creepy it looked especially when it went out of view,” said the YouTube user.But comments left under the video by other users were more cynical.“Thats balloons” read one while another said “its balloons you - can see it when he zooms on it when it goes down”."},{"url":null,"title":"child support claiming unemployed ex","story":"Rebecca Desmond, , says she filmed Rob Atkinson strutting around the Armthorpe branch of Tesco in Doncaster at around pm after buying alcohol at a self check-out in a hi-vis jacket.When the man, who is wearing a hi-vis yellow jacket and trousers, realises he’s being filmed he mutters weirdo before walking out of the store to a branded Direct Traffic van.Rebecca, a self-employed therapist, said she followed Rob into the store on March  after becoming enraged because she claims he owes her thousands in unpaid child support over the last three and a half years.An unveried benefits letter indicates that Robert Atkinson owes £,. in arrears.The mum-of-one said: “The man owes me thousands in unpaid maintenance but he’s covered head to toe in tattoos.“He’s told everyone he doesn’t work.She added that Rob appeared shocked by the encounter.“Rob didn’t know what to do, she said. He called me a weirdo then he huffed a little bit, had a ‘big man walk’ back to the van and that was it.“He couldnt get out of there quick enough.Rebecca said she welcomed Robs recent attempt to become part of -year-old daughter Freyas le after years of minimal contact.The couple split up ten years ago after four years of dating, when Freya was just nine months old.In September last year Rob got back in touch, sending her card in which he vowed to stop being a rubbish dad.And after visiting his house, Freya was excited to learn she was going to be a bridesmaid at Rob’s wedding in Mexico.Rebecca said: “I thought it was brilliant and welcomed it with open arms only to be met with ‘we’re getting married, we want her to be a bridesmaid but I’m still not going to pay you any money’.“I said that he needed to put some money down and start paying off his debts before playing happy families and then he could take her on holiday.She says that since then Rob has gone off Freyas radar, adding: “I’ve had to work really hard for  years to make sure Freya’s got what she has now.“Now he’s disappeared again and she’s not heard from him since. It’s really cruel, I can’t ever forgive him for that.”Rob, , denies he claimed to be unemployed, and described the allegations against him as absolutely crackers.He says there are outstanding payments because he only recently got a tax code but admits now he needs to ring Child Maintenance Service.And he says claims the letter stating that he owes more than £, in child support arrears is inaccurate as he has only worked here and there over the last couple of years.Rob said he had four children from three mothers.Every single one of the other mothers are all up to date with all their payments, everything’s up to date, everythings sorted, he said. [Rebecca] is the trouble.He claimed he was self-employed and only worked a couple of days work a week.Rob says he was in the army three and a half years ago, and didnt work at all for the first  months as he was medically unwell.He claims the £, figures appeared to have come from totting up £ a month over three years.But he says that the CMS had an incorrect picture of when hed actually worked, and that his income is based on his Army pension.Rob also denied he was getting married, allegedly saying: There’s not a wedding happening, [so there was] no mention of [Freya] being a bridesmaid.A DWP spokesman said they could not comment on inidual cases.The spokesman said: “We’re committed to recovering owed child maintenance and recently introduced tougher powers to take people’s assets into account – including property, savings and investments and self-declared income.If someone suspects their ex-partner of avoiding paying child maintenance, they should inform us straight away so we can investigate fully.”Direct Traffic Management Ltd said they could not comment due to data protection legislation."},{"url":null,"title":"honda factory swindon

The whale had already breached multiple times much further away from the fisherman.But sometimes when whales breach multiple times, theyre also heading a specic direction when theyre underwater building momentum for the next breach.I figured the next breach would be around the fisherman because the whale was heading that way and sure enough!

It’s never been easier to leave chickens off your plate.”All of the footage has been passed to the RSPCA, Red Tractor and Defra’s Animal and Plant Health Agency.A Nando’s spokesman told the Mirror: “Animal welfare is as important to us as it is to customers, which is why all of our chickens are barn-reared in the UK to Red Tractor standards.“We expect all our suppliers to operate to high standards and we are disappointed with the footage.“We will be working with the supplier to get to the bottom of these allegations.”An Aa Foods spokesman told The Sun Online: “We take our responsibilities for the birds in our care very seriously and their health and welfare is of the utmost importance.“Our farmers are required to carefully inspect flocks on a daily basis – to identy any birds requiring attention or which may need to be culled.“We have closely examined the contents of this report to assess compliance against our procedures.“Initial findings indicate that, for the farm involved, our requirement to remove any culled or fallen birds as soon as they are identied has not been followed.“We will take all necessary action to ensure that this situation does not reoccur.“Anyone found not to be meeting our standards will be subjected to comprehensive retraining and further steps will be takenappropriate.“Red Tractor, the RSPCA and the Government’s Animal  Plant Health Agency have also made unannounced visits since this footage was taken and were satisfied with the health and welfare of the birds.”A spokesman for restaurant chain Nando’s said: “Animal welfare is as important to us as it is to customers, which is why all of our chickens are barn-reared in the UK to Red Tractor standards.“We expect all our suppliers to operate to high standards and we are disappointed with the footage.“We will be working with the supplier to get to the bottom of these allegations.”Asda and Lidl referred to a statement from the British Retail Consortium.The BRC said: “Our members take their responsibilities to animal welfare very seriously and work closely with trusted suppliers so that high welfare standards are upheld.“They have strict processes in place and will thoroughly investigate any evidence of non-conformity to ensure that any problems are immediately addressed.”Pimlico Farm referred to the statement from Aa Foods while Helmdon and Evenley were unavailable for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy hunt increase britain defence budget","story":"The Foreign Secretary called for “a strengthening of our hard power” in the next defence review to cement Britain’s place in a post-Brexit world.The powerful intervention is the boldest yet in a shadow Tory leadership contest already being fought by more than a dozen senior MPs.The offer from Mr Hunt – seen as one of the frontrunners to succeed Theresa May – will be seen as tailor-made to appeal to Tory members.He told the Lord Mayor’s Banquet last night: ““I believe it is time for the next Strategic Defence and Security Review to ask whether, over the coming decade, we should decisively increase the proportion of GDP we devote to defence.“The outcome of such investment should demonstrate beyond doubt that when we say Britain stands for the defence of democratic values then we are as good as our word.”The threat is also rising, from “a more aggressive Russia and a more assertive China”, Mr Hunt argued.And rapidly advancing technology could see Britain soon face a multi-dimensional assault which starts with a cyber attack and is followed by “hypersonic missiles” and “swarms of unmanned aircraft”, he warmed.The  year-old Tory MP added: “We simply do not know what the balance of power in the world will be in  years time”.It is also “not sustainable” to rely on the US’s massive defence spending while most of Europe spends so little.Mr Hunt’s aides insist it was for the MoD to map out exactly how big their raise must be.But his words will raise MPs’ hopes that the defence budget will lt from % of GDP today - the minimum NATO spending target – to %, or an extra £bn a year.Mr Hunt’s intervention risks a fresh Cabinet row by infuriating new Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt.Neither she nor No were briefed on Mr Hunt’s speech until a few hours before he made it, it also emerged.One Cabinet source dubbed it “poor form”, as well as a tit-for-tat invitation for others to “have views on his brief”.Issuing a broad vision for post-Brexit Britain that ranged well beyond his brief, Mr Hunt also hinted tax cuts will be needed once we quit the EU – issuing a call to “put fuel in the engine of the British economy”.Mr Hunt also warned that a nuke deal row raised risks of an Iran-US war “by accident” — ahead of his talks with White House Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.His defence pledge received a warm welcome from former-forces Tory MPs.Ex-Army officer-turned Johnny Mercer said: “If we are to be the party of defence, it’s about time we proved it with the proper resourcing”.Yes, Labour: The party run by delusional peacenik Jeremy Corbyn, who wants to scrap our nuclear deterrent and cannot see “any circumstances” in which he would deploy troops.The man who said: “Wouldn’t it be wonderfulevery politician, instead of taking pride in the size of their armed forces, abolished their army ”Yet somehow, as Government cuts let our military strength wither, Labour’s defence spokeswoman Nia Grfith managed to talk tougher on nukes, troop numbers and spending than the Tories.So Jeremy Hunt’s latest salvo is a very welcome statement of intent.It is vital, the Foreign Secretary says, that we stand with America in defending the West’s democracies against the new, rising threats from an “aggressive” Russia and “assertive” China. And against new forms of war entirely.That, he says, means a sharp increase in spending to avoid our US allies fearing they are propping up Nato alone.It will set an example to EU nations who underspend and take for granted their safety, underwritten by American might.“Strength is the surest guarantee of peace,” Mr Hunt says. That’s dead right.It’s a simple concept old hippies like Corbyn, inclined instead to capitulate and hope for mercy, will never grasp.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Among these cases, a large proportion is related to a disruption of this neuronal pathway commonly known as the melanocortin pathway.We observed the deletion of the ACBP gene in astrocytes of the arcuate nucleus promotes obesity.In mice that were genetically modied to be obese, we observed in the laboratory that injecting them daily with ACBP led to a reduction of food intake and weight loss in the order of  per cent over five days - a mechanism that relies on the activation of POMC neurons.Uncovering the neurological causes of obesity could combat one of the biggest health problems in the world.It affects one-in-four adults in the UK and more than a third in the US - potentially leading to diabetes, heart disease, some cancers, musculoskeletal disorders and premature death.Although its driven by environmental factors - such as limitless access to sugar and fat-laden foods and increasingly sedentary lestyles - not everyone becomes overweight.It has been estimated genetics contribute up to  percent towards a persons vulnerability to piling on the pounds.Most mutations occur in the hypothalamus - a region of grey matter that monitors levels of the hormone leptin that is secreted by fat cells.Prof Alquier and colleagues said staying in shape is more brain-related than previously thought - regardless of exercise levels or food intake.He pointed out the study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation is at the basic research stage and was carried out in laboratory experiments on mice.Prof Alquier urged caution in translating the findings to humans. But he said they may represent a novel therapeutic avenue for obesity.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

who had called for negotiations over ending Irans nuclear programme.Just minutes before the sabotage attack was revealed today, the US Maritime Administration warned shippers to exercise caution when travelling past Fujairah.The general-secretary of the Gulf Cooperation Council described the sabotage as a serious escalation in an overnight statement.Abdullat bin Rashid al-Zayani said: Such irresponsible acts will increase tension and conflicts in the region and expose its peoples to great danger.Earlier this month, the Maritime Administration warned that US commercial ships including oil tankers sailing through key Middle East waterways could be targeted by Iran in one of the threats to US interests posed by Tehran.Irans foreign ministry spokesman called the incidents on Sunday to ships near the coast of Fujairah worrisome and dreadful, and asked for an investigation into the matter."},{"url":null,"title":"uber shares plummet 12 to just 30 on first full day of trading as miserable start to public offering continues","story":"Questions are flying across Wall Street as a result of yesterdays dramatic tumble, says Bloomberg.Ubers market capitalisation has plunged to about  billion since it began trading as a public company last Friday.While that figure is still larger than Wall Street heavyweights including General Motors and FedEx, the concern is that the syndicate led by Morgan Stanley might have set the firms initial offering pricetoo aggressively, said Bloomberg.People are asking questions, including why did bankers such as Morgan Stanley suggest a  billion valuation last year that Uber couldnt deliver, it added.With its unclear path to profitability, its having a more dficult time with Wall Street investors.Mondays fall in shares comes against the backdrop of a global stock market selloff sparked by renewed trade tensions between the United States and China, reported news agency Reuters.Bloomberg pointed out that Ubers slide in the first two days of trading was complicated by a lot of bad luck, including the abrupt flare-up last week in US-China trade negotiations that drove markets down around the globe.The ride-hailing giants chief executive officer, Dara Khosrowshahi, said he expected the stock to remain under pressure in the coming months.Monday saw its stock hit a low of ., valuing the company at about billion less than the launch price of .By comparison, shares of smaller rival Lyft Inc, which went public at  a share on March , were down .% at ..Khosrowshahi admitted that Ubers stock did not trade as well as we had hoped post-IPO.He said: Sentiment does not change overnight, and I expect some tough public market times over the coming months.But we have all the capital we need to demonstrate a path to improved margins and profits.Uber lowered its valuation expectations twice in the past two months to address investor concerns over its mounting losses.And it finally priced its launch price at the low end of the targeted range in a bid to avoid Lyfts stock market struggles.Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Floridas Warrington College of Business told Bloomberg: In retrospect, the underwriters should have done a better job at figuring how strong the true demand was.The Associated Press said that among the recent big investors and perhaps losers is PayPal, which had disclosed plans to buy  million in Uber stock at the IPO price of .Both Uber and Lyft are trying to find ways to lower driver costs to become profitable.Yet many investors are concerned about rising costs associated with booking fees shared with drivers, said Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust.Morgan said this expense would only rise as the company increased sales and demand for drivers grew.Investors have struggled to figure out how much Uber and Lyft are worth, given that both companies have not estimated a timeline for turning a profit.Uber has warned in a regulatory filing that it may never be profitable.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Initial figures suggest at least  people were turned away from polling stations across eight of the ten regions targeted to test out the plan. Some  voters were turned away in Derby alone. And on average  voters failed to vote in each pilot this year, an increase from  in pilots held around last year’s local elections. Dferent voter ID schemes are on trial in each region, each requiring some combination of photo ID or other kinds of ID. On election night the Mirror revealed an -year-old woman was denied the right to vote in Pendle, where a total of  people were turned away. The pensioner attacked the “stupid” system after taking a taxi to her local polling station in Pendle, Lancashire, only to be told she couldn’t vote. She told the Mirror she brought a photograph of herself, rather than a photo ID, after she misunderstood the instructions.   Cat Smith, Labour ’s Shadow Minister for Voter Engagement, said: As we feared, legitimate and honest voters have been denied their right to vote because of these undemocratic and unpopular pilot schemes.Time and time again Labour has warned that Voter ID will make it harder for people to vote but the Conservatives have pushed on with their blatant attempt to rig the result of future elections by voter suppression. After another round of shambolic pilot schemes, itaposs clear that Voter ID has no place in our democracy and should be abandoned immediately. It came as a cross-party letter urged ministers to abandon the plan, saying it would disproportionately affect vulnerable people and communities and was an attempt at voter suppression.”   The letter, from Labour, the Liberal Democrats , SNP , Plaid Cymru and the Green Party read: “The Windrush scandal has demonstrated very clearly that it can be more dficult for some communities to provide official documentation than others.“As representatives of major opposition parties, we believe that what is really going on here is a blatant attempt by the Conservatives to rig the result of future elections by making it harder for people to vote – it’s voter suppression. “At a time when millions of people are missing from the electoral register, we won’t allow this government to close down our democracy. “In light of the overwhelming evidence base, we are of the collective view that these dangerous voter ID trials must be scrapped as a matter of urgency.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn cannot shake labours","story":"NewsopinionJeremy Corbyn cannot shake Labours Brexit headacheLabour has woken up to the fact its position on Brexit no longer works.

Christine added: “Hugh went into Castle View in good health and we were told he’d be well looked after. “We couldn’t believe the state he was in when we ed home. His head and face were covered in painful open sores and he was left lying on his bed with nothing covering his genitals. He was treated worse than an animal and shown no dignity whatsoever.    “Hugh’s health was failing staying there, he was badly let down. He could have died. We want this home shut down.” Maisie, , added: “If Hugh had been left there any longer, he wouldn’t be with us. The way he was treated was unacceptable and I’ve never seen anything like it in my le. We want answers.” A spokeswoman for Castle View said Hugh came in with a fungal infection and insisted they were sorry over “initial issues with ensuring his condition was treated correctly or that parts of his room were not as clean as they could have been”.    But they disputed claims Hugh was not fed or washed properly. The spokeswoman added: “The health, safety and wellbeing of all our residents are our top priorities, and our staff work hard to deliver the best care for them.” The Care Inspectorate confirmed a concern had been raised and it is “considering all information in  relation to it carefully”.

That’s because Geordie student Alisha, now , who was duly announced as Miss England, had been suffering hearing loss for four years. “It was very scary,” she recalls. “I was OK with one-on-one ­conversations indoors, but I ­struggled to keep upI was talking to two or more people. When I was in a crowded place, everything was just noise to me and I could never make voices and conversations out.“I’d go completely deaf outside in windy weather and wouldn’t go to a rock concert or anything really loud. It was annoying and embarrassing because I’d have to ask people to repeat themselves.“When I was asked a question by the Miss England judges, I had to ask for that to be repeated.”    Alisha, who was born in ­Gateshead and raised in Newcastle, recalls, “In , I noticed that my hearing was going in one ear. The problem came and went. I was only  and assumed it was temporary. But when I hit  it became worse so I visited my GP. He checked my ear health and said it was fine. “The problem got worse but I was told repeatedly there was nothing wrong.” Then, last August, just before her th birthday, Alisha visited Boots for a hearing test. She wasn’t prepared for the news that she had premature hearing loss in both of her ears. “I knew I had an issue with my right ear, which is why I had gone for help, but apparently my right ear was only slightly worse than my left, which I hadn’t realised. The audiologist performed the test twice because he couldn’t believe that an -year-old could have such bad hearing loss.” Alisha was devastated. “I was told my hearing could stay that way forever, or it could deteriorate further. I was shocked. I thought I was too young for something like this to happen.” At the time, Alisha was studying Crime Scene Investigation And Forensic Science at Teesside University, hoping to become a detective.    She had no idea how the diagnosis would affect her future. The audiologist referred her on to an ear specialist for further investigations, so she simply had to wait. Her confidence was knocked, and Alisha almost didn’t compete in the Miss England competition the following month for fear her dficulties would hold her back, but finally resolved to go for it. “I decided that I couldn’t let it get me down,” she explains. “I began to learn sign language and to lip read, sothe worst was to happen I’d have options and it would not be the end of the world. I’ll be honest, I’m still not great at signing.” Since taking the title, Alisha has been busy fulfilling official duties as Miss England, all the while still waiting for her appointment with the specialist. So when, during an interview on BBC Breakfast in April this year, Alisha had to ask co-hosts Louise Minchin and Dan Walker to repeat their questions, her hearing ­problems were spotted by an employee of private healthcare company Hidden Hearing, who invited her into the company’s Newcastle branch for further tests. “They told me the problem could be ­hereditary, that I could have been born with damage to the tiny bones in my ears, or perhaps I’d hit my head as a child which could cause damage to the nerves or bones. “If my problem is to do with the bones rather than nerves it’s unlikely to get worse. An operation could fix them but that comes with the risk of nerve damage. I felt that, for me, the best option was hearing aids.” Hidden Hearing fitted Alisha with their Oticon Opn S hearing aids, which – unlike traditional aids which restrict focus to one sound at a time – give your brain access to more sounds around you. “I wear them all the time, except when I go to sleep,” says Alisha. “They’re making a massive ­dference. Now I can even hear what somebody behind me is saying. They’re also discreet, but I wouldn’t be embarrassedpeople know I wear them. Lots of people lose their hearing.” “I will probably have to wear hearing aids for the rest of my le, but I’m fine about that,” she adds. “They’re already making my le so much better.”For further information, visit hiddenhearing "},{"url":null,"title":"mum 34 went out lunch","story":"NewsMum, , went out for lunch with baby daughter hours before jumping off A bridgeThe family of Stephanie Housley saw no warning signs that the mum-of-one was planning to take her own le, an inquest heardShareCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter:,  MAY NewsBrother and sister Simon and Stephanie Housley \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum-of-one went out for lunch with her daughter hours before she jumped from a bridge and took her own le.Stephanie Housley was suffering from postnatal depression after the birth of her daughter, an inquest heard.

But her family saw no warning signs that she was planning to take her own le.    She had been out for lunch with a relative and her daughter at the Weathervane pub, in Meir Park, on the day of her death. In a statement read out at yesterdayaposs inquest, Stephanieaposs partner James Walton said: Iaposve been in a relationship with Steph for  months. We found out we were having a baby together, moved in together, and were so happy. Following the birth of our daughter, Steph suffered with postnatal depression. Our daughter was having stomach problems and we discovered she had a dairy intolerance. It was a hard time for both of us, especially waking up every two hours, we didnapost know what was wrong. Steph was admitted to a parent and baby unit to receive some support. It started to become easier and Steph went back to work as a carer at UK Care Management. She loved caring for people, although she did not enjoy the long hours. It restricted time with her daughter as she did -hour shts two days a week. This was due to change to three days, that was the only thing playing on Stephaposs mind, she just wanted to be a mum. The inquest heard Stephanie had attempted to kill herself twice before and her dad committed suicide when she was a child. James last saw her alive at am on March  when he made her a cup of tea and took their baby into her. Stephanie and the relative shared three bottles of wine during their meal at the Weathervane. They then walked to Tesco, at Meir Park, before the relative took Stephanieaposs daughter home. A dog-walker saw Stephanie sitting cross-legged on the bridge at .pm on March . She said: She turned to me and smiled. She looked very well presented and did not look upset. So I carried on walking my dog. I looked back but carried on walking down and I called  and then  to raise concerns. But the inquest heard Stephanie fell to her death before the police could arrive. The dog-walker added: I didnapost have time to go over. Recording a conclusion of suicide, assistant coroner Sarah Murphy said: I want to stress that having heard the evidence of Mr Walton there was absolutely no way that Mr Walton, or any of her family, could have known that that was her intention. We heard she had a lovely time in the afternoon, there was absolutely no indication that that was going through her mind. I hope her family and friends go away knowing there was nothing they could have done to prevent this. She was taking medication and had sought help.

Beth Martin, , was training to become part of the UKaposs Border Force when she had an unexpected arrival. Unaware she was expecting, the size six student had been undertaking extreme physical activity such as army and police riot training throughout her pregnancy - and during her labour. Known as a aposcryptic pregnancyapos, Bethaposs baby Maizie, now seven months old, had grown behind Bethaposs ribs, showing no physical bump - and has even failed to show up on two pregnancy tests. Staying the same size for the entire duration of her pregnancy, Beth, from St Anneaposs, Blackpool had put tiredness down to her intensive training.   And when she finally went into labour, she put contraction pains down to a severe case of Irritable Bowel Syndrome .Beth said, Iaposd taken a pregnancy tests two months before Maizie was born in October, . Someone at work had said I looked pregnant and I remember thinking how rude she was. I was doing a course into unormed public services and had my heart set on becoming part of Border Force. My education was sport based, about  hours a week of intense physical activity. The week before Iaposd had Maizie, I was doing riot police force training, where I had horses chasing me - it seemed surreal.  Beth had noticed she had gained a small amount of weight, and became breathless easily - but all the pregnancy tests she took came back negative. When she began getting stabbing pains in her abdomen after training at college, Beth rang NHS  for advice. After realising Beth was spotting, the call handler quickly realised the teen was in labour and sent her straight to A+E. Little Maizie Loraine Martin was born after  hours of labour,  hours of pushing  less than  hours preparation for Beth, weighing lbs oz. Beth added, By the time I got to the hospital I was in so much pain.  A nurse told me straight away I looked pregnant - and then I discovered Iaposve been in labour for  hours.

Roy Batt, ,who is the father of UK chart-topper David Zowie, stabbed himself in the chest at his home in Chatham, Kent, in January this year, after telling his GP he didnapost feel like living. His we Sylvia Potter told investigators after suffering a serious car crash in  he had needed help with every day tasks and she became his carer. In the weeks before his death, Mr Batt told his GP he didnapost feel like living anymore but the depakote and venlafaxine pills he had been taking for over twenty years were not reviewed.    Side effects of the drugs include suicidal thoughts and actions, the coroner heard. The devoted grandfather was seriously injured in the  crash and had been taking the same anti-depressants since , an inquest at Maidstoneaposs Archbishopaposs Palace heard this week. While in a coma after the crash Mr Battaposs family wrote to David Bowie. The iconic Le on Mars singer sent a tape of himself urging Mr Batt to come round. His daughter Janine said: I was only seven at the time but I remember we played it every day for several weeks while he was in his coma. Janine said her dad was covered in Ziggy Stardust tattoos and used to dress like Bowie. On January , Mr Batt took his dog for a walk and bought his lottery tickets as normal. He was due to go to his famous sonaposs house to watch a football match but suddenly decided he did not want to go. As Mrs Potter waited at the window for David she heard a noise and ran to the kitchen to find her husband clutching his chest. He said I love you girl before slumping to the floor, she told the inquest. Despite the best efforts of medics, the retired bricklayer died of a punctured lung and heart. Assistant coroner Katrina Hepburn heard a police investigation established there had been no third-party involvement. She recorded a verdict of suicide.    Son David, , whose  smash hit House Every Weekend has been viewed  million times on YouTube, paid tribute to his father after the inquest. He said: My dad was my absolute hero, I loved him to bits.

He was so clever and the only guy who could beat me at anagrams. Iaposm still coming to terms with what happened. Mr Battaposs daughter Janine, , said: He was the most intelligent and talented person we knew - a devoted father, granddad and husband - who also helped physically build his community. We built some treasured memories together. Two years ago he became a grandfather, a role he loved that gave him a new lease of le and an unbreakable bond with his granddaughter. But she added the family were concerned about the high dosage and combination of medicines he was prescribed.  She said: His medication wasnapost reviewed even after he told his GP his mood was low - it was actually increased. There was no extra support and we feel like our dadaposs death could have been prevented. Instead we are left deeply heartbroken and in shock - it was so sudden and we are still wondering why.

And forecasters believe tomorrow, Wednesday, will be even hotter at C. There will be some winds in southern coastal areas but much of the UK will be basking in sunshine today. Unusually, those in the Highlands of Scotland could be the warmest of all where temperatures could hit C. According to the Met Office , Tuesday will see high pressure drt further eastwards. It means for a lot of us it will be sunny weather by day - but we will have chilly nights.  Met Office meteorologist Alex Deakin said: “It’s going to be another sunny day. “It will be a bit breezy along the English channel coast but for most places lots of sunshine.    “But quite quickly those temperatures will be falling once more and it will turn a bit chilly yet again on Wednesday morning so again expect a fresh start to the day.  Despite that “fresh start” Mr Deakin warned that there will be more sunshine for many across the UK. Meteorologist Craig Snell told The Sun Online: Weaposre going to be expecting very dry weather with plenty of sun within the next three days. The temperature will peak on Wednesday, reaching C in parts of Scotland and northern England. Weaposre going to see some rain creep in the the second half of the week, as temperatures will begin to settle down on Friday.    The Met Office website says: A cold start with frost in places, but soon clearing in the sunshine. Skies will stay mainly clear, except for the odd patch of cloud It will be warm during the afternoon, although a little fresher along some coasts. Wednesdayaposs is similar and reads: After a chilly start it will be another warm, dry and sunny day across the UK.  Some thin, high cloud may turn the sunshine a little hazy in the west. Come Friday however, and periods of rain may signal a slide back into the dreary weather that was cast over the isle last week. An unsettled weekend will see rain, cloud and stronger winds taking daytime temperatures below the seasonal average.

The couple, both in their s, got engaged just months after they first met. But whataposs most unusual about their love story is that they first clapped eyes on each other when they moved into a sheltered housing developement in the Wirral, Merseyside. Joe, , was so smitten with Rachel he propsed on Valentineaposs Day. The couple, who both love gardening, have seven children,  grandchildren and  great-grandchildren between them.    Rachel, , who worked as a social worker for  years, lost her first husband a year ago, She said: We fell in love straight away. It was like magic. I was never a believer in the whole falling in love at first sight thing, but that’s what it was like. Joe, who is a retired nuclear power station foreman, plucked up the courage to ask Rachel out for a meal in November after they bonded over a Remembrance Sunday chat. He said: “I had a few tears in my eyes thinking about my we, who I lost last year.    “I had come back from a walk and Rachel was sat on the couch near our apartments doing a jigsaw and she called me over for a chat. She was very kind and talked to me. Things went from there.” The couple have been together ever since and Joe popped the question over a meal in his flat - which was filled with candles and roses. He said: You’ve got to look forward. The loved-up pair hope their story will inspire more people to continue to find love later in le and not see a move into new accommodation as a backwards step.  Rachel said: “Sometimes there’s a bit of stigma around people living in sheltered developments, but it’s absolute nonsense.”  “We may be a little older, but we know how to have a good time. Some of the parties we have are fantastic! “I’m so glad I’ve met Joe. It’s been tough times for both of us, but you can’t live in the past. You’ve got to look forward. “We’re both really positive people and we’ve got lots of good years ahead of us.” Joe added: “We couldn’t ask for a better place to live. “We’ve got lots of friends, we’re always out in the community and we don’t have a house to run. It’s one of the best decisions I’ve made. Now I’ve met Rachel, it’s even better!” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman shouts im pregnant before","story":"NewsWoman shouts Im pregnant before being shot dead by policeWARNING, GRAPHIC FOOTAGE: Baytown PD in Texas are reported to be investigating the shooting which was filmed and posted on social mediaShareCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video woman-shouts-im-pregnant-before-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, combinedPrompt :true, options :, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, combinedPrompt :true, options :, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman can be heard shouting aposIaposm pregnantapos before being shot by police. A video of the altercation between the woman - said to have been unarmed - and police in Baytown, Texas is being widely shared online. The woman has not been identied at this stage but an investigation into the shooting is underway, according to US reports. In the video, the woman can be heard saying that she is pregnant moments before being shot.Police say she had managed to arm herself with the officeraposs Taser before being shot.    Baytown Police Department have released few details about the incident - thought to have happened last night - and have not confirmedthe woman was actually pregnant. According to KHOU-TV, the woman was shot and killed by the officer. Brett Buffington reported that homicide investigators were at the scene at the apartment complex where the shooting occurred early today. It was a sad situation. Tragic. The lady... she did live here. We would often see her, see her walk her dog around, said resident Raquelle Cuellar.  Baytown Police Department reportedly wrote on Facebook: Baytown Detectives are on the scene of an Officer involved shooting in the block of Garth Road. It is very early in the investigation however what detectives have learned thus far is on of our officers, an  year veteran with the department, was patrolling an apartment complex in the  block of Garth Road when he came across a -year-old female that he knew from previous encounters and knew she had outstanding warrants.  The officer contacted the female and attempted to arrest her at which time a struggle ensued, forcing the officer to deploy his department issued Taser at the female . It appears that as the officer was then attempting to handcuff the female she was able to gain control of his Taster and turned it on th officer, Tasing the officer, which forced the officer to draw his duty weapon and fire multiple rounds at the female, striking her at least once. The female has been pronounced deceased at the scene. The post is no longer available with the Facebook page believed to have been taken down. In the video, posted to Facebook and Twitter by multiple users, the woman can be heard telling the officer she is walking to her house.The officer who shot the woman appears to be the only officer at the scene during the incident. The woman can be seen walking as she tells the officer he is “harassing” her.    The pop of a stun gun can be heard as the officer appears to fire his Taser at the woman. It is not clearthe stun gun hit the woman. The woman can then be seen on the ground with the officer on top of her, trying to grab her hands. The woman yells, “I’m pregnant,” and the officer steps away from her as she appears to be moving her hands near his legs. As the woman sits up, the officer fires his gun five times and the woman falls back to the ground. It is not clear how many times she was shot.

If it’s that one game and I’ve made that contribution, then I’m happy with that.“The reception that I received at Easter Road was incredible. To get a song after being on the pitch for  seconds which was nice! I really enjoyed it and appreciated it from the fans.“They understand my role here and I’m just trying to do my best for the team and the club.“I’m the happiest guy when we win.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby youngsters lead oban to victory","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowYoung Mid Argyll rugby players Drew Buckley, Anya Gritten and Amber Russell took part in the Glasgow Warriors championship with their Oban U Girls team mates on Wednesday February .The girls won all four of their games, scoring a remarkable  tries and conceding only two.They also played in the first round of the Scottish Cup in Oban against East Kilbride on Sunday February , progressing to the next round after an  impressive - points victory.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

But Auchinleck Estate is carving its own niche in tourism. And its history is every bit as fascinating as nearby Dumfries House Estate. You could argue that renowned biographer James Boswell elevates Auchinleck to even greater signicance than its neighbour. The Boswells had been at Auchinleck for  years before the two rival Georgian ‘big hooses’ were built in the s. “The original Auchinleck House, now a ruin, dates from ,” says historian Billy Cooper. “James IV gave Thomas Boswell the land, but the pair of them were to die together at Flodden in . “There’s an even earlier castle on the estate, and we’re hoping to locate a medieval graveyard.” Billy, , from Ochiltree, along with others, has founded a Friends of Boswell group of volunteers. “It’s a gem of a place –unchanged for centuries, and I just love the history of it all,” he says. Retired policeman Billy has been a guide at Culzean Castle and Dumfries House –but Auchinleck Estate excites him even more. “There’s gothic bridges over gorges, there’s a grotto, and there’s lots more to discover. “When Dr Johnson travelled here in , he had hardly seen a tree since Carlisle, and was impressed with planting done at Auchinleck,” said Billy. Rory Boswell, who runs the farm on Auchinleck Estate, is delighted to have the friends’ group on board. He said: “Since childhood, I’ve loved this wild, rustic place. “We’re the Boswells, we live here, we farm here, we’re still here.” Rory, , recounts a story of two old men, in their s, who used to make tea at the spring, when he was just a lad. He said: “There’s clearly health benefits to people enjoying access to the estate.” The friends are helping to restore gardens and walks that can be enjoyed by all. Rory said: “I have a brother in the army, so I’m pleased that groups like Combat Stress are getting involved.” He is rearing magnicent Highland Cattle, and hopes that one day there will be a steak restaurant alongside the very popular Boswell’s Coach House.

Therersquos natural field run off, from the field to the south.ldquoMost of that seems to occur to the west of the site, but wersquore going to prevent any more run off by installing a cut off drain all the way around the site which will collect the water.ldquoThis drain will be connected to a culvert which runs under the railway to the north, and eventually runs into the Eye.ldquoThe other issue is that surface water is getting into the combined sewer that serves this area, and is causing problems down stream.ldquoSome road gullies are connected into this combined sewer and are causing surcharge of the sewer and in some cases flooding.ldquoWersquove out careful design into this, and wersquore not taking surface water to the combined sewer, wersquore taking it to the culvert under the railway.ldquoIt will be taken off at a very attenuated rate, at just two litres a second, which is a very small amount of water. The culvert could take up to  litres.Following an hour-long discussion, councillors were finally able to decide that the proposals could go ahead, providing that in depth surveys were conducted into drainage and foul water flooding.The site will then be subject to planning conditions once the scale of the problem is known.Speaking in favour of approving the planning application, Kelso and District councillor Simon Mountford said: ldquoWe have to ask ourselves: do the proposals represent a suitable development  I think yes they do.ldquoAre the proposals acceptable in terms of parking and road safety  I think yes they are.ldquoI am a little concerned about industrial traffic but I feel this could be mitigated by an industrial road.Lauderdale and Melrose councillor Tom Miers told the committee: ldquoI think for me the main concern is absolutely drainage and flooding.ldquoWe need to be absolutely certain that any new development will not exacerbate any existing problems.ldquoI think it would be useful to include a condition that we require written evidence that the development will not add to the issues.ldquoIt needs to be in black and white, that according to the evidence it will not create more problems.East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton said: ldquoThere must be some sort of attenuation to the drainage. If that work was done before construction starts, then that would be useful.ldquoIt would be the best option to make sure this is all in place before any work starts.Councillors voted to approve the application, with the exception of Galashiels and District councillor Sandy Aitchison, who voted against."},{"url":null,"title":"junior-choir-delights-with-anniversary-show","story":"REVIEWBy Revd Pamela StrachanEddleston Junior ChoirAN exploding lsquoTreble Clefrsquo culminated an evening of joyous music from the Eddleston Parish Church Junior Choir last Friday evening, as Musical Director, Lorraine Mulholland, cut the spectacular Pintildeata cake.Baked by one of the Junior Choir mothers, Teresa Bedford, the fabulous cake was a fitting tribute to  years of this little choir bringing its vitality and exuberance to worship in the church.As well as giving regular concerts over the years, the young singers have raised money for charity, made their own CD and brought joy to the elderly in residential homes in Peebles.The choir has also been the starting point for many talented young musicians who have gone on to become accomplished young soloists, as we heard on Friday evening.The programme began with a touching performance of lsquoHumility  Appreciationrsquo from The Little Triangleand was followed by solo pieces from past choir members.After learning the piano for merely a year, young Izzy Steele gave a confident performance of two solo pieces, along with a duet of Bobby Shafto.Izzy already plays with great expression as the audience heard Bobby cheerfully setting sail but then becoming queasy with seasickness only for his spirits to lt as he heads for home once again.Very competent performances followed by both Jenner Brownand Shona Sinclairas they demonstrated how participation in the Junior Choir has fostered their talent and love of music.Jenner played lsquoRussianrsquo by Martrei Blanter, Blue Dayand Allegro Assai rd Movement from Concertino in D Major by Ferdinand Kuchler.These pieces would have been a challenge for older players, but this young violinist played with great panache.Shona Sinclair gave a similarly spirited performance on the piano with Branle de la Torche by Michael Praetorius, Shadows by Walter Carrol and the lively Scott Joplin number, The Entertainer.Rowan Steele, older sister of Izzy, delighted the audience with her performance on fiddle, with Farewell to the Glenand A Set of Shetland Reels.Rowan and Jenner then performed together on violin and fiddle with The Love of the Islesand Stomach Steinway Man, written by Ian Lowthian who was born in the Scottish Borders where he still works as a music teacher and educator.The ten young singers who currently make up the Eddleston Junior Choir produce a lsquobig soundrsquo and sing with such obvious pleasure and enthusiasm.The Lemonade Kid by Peter Fardellgave them all scope for their exuberance, as did their repeat performance of A Midsummer Nightrsquos Dream by Kane and Kane.We were treated to this at the summer concert last year and such was the choirrsquos obvious delight in performing this number, we were told they requested to sing it again.That seems to be the secret of this young choirrsquos success all the young members thoroughly enjoy the singing and performing, the rhythm and the sheer pleasure of making music.Delighted parents in the audience confirmed how much their children enjoy belonging to the choir as Lorraine Mulholland was presented with bouquets and warmly thanked by the Reverend Calum Macdougall for her  years of dedication and commitment to so many young singers in Eddleston and Peebles.The Church, parents and the Eddleston community all owe a huge debt to this inspirational Musical Director and music teacher."},{"url":null,"title":"inspirational-stories-set-for-borders-book-festival","story":"INSPIRATIONAL stories will told at this yearrsquos Borders Book Festival.

reassess the regionrsquos CCTV networks, following news it is being allowed to fall into disrepair.Recently, council officers reported that the CCTV network is ldquono longer fit for purpose.And it was revealed that neither the local authority nor the police can afford to install and maintain the security systems.Currently,  of the councilrsquos  CCTV cameras dont work, and that number is likely to increase in the coming months and years.Now, Tweeddale East councillor, Stuart Bell, has put forward a motion for the local authorityrsquos next meeting, asking officers to produce a list of options for revitalising the failing CCTV network.He said: ldquoEffective public CCTV can make a positive contribution to community safety which is primarily the responsibility of the police but one in which the council has an obvious part to play.ldquoHowever, the capability of the system now operating in Border towns has deteriorated.ldquoWhilst there are limited budgeted council funds to invest in the current CCTV system, and whilst there will be advantages in opening up opportunities for communities to participate in the definition of what is needed, any decisions need to be based on a quantied assessment of costs.ldquoI ask officers to prepare a report showing the costs and options for renewing or replacing existing public CCTV for each community with a CCTV system to make that information part of a consultation with area partnerships, community planning partners and the police, fire and rescue, and safer communities board, before bringing forward a final report for consideration by this council.ldquoFurther to this that officers bring a report to the next Council meeting with a consultation plan, including whether outside resources will need to be brought in, the cost of consultation and a timescale for that consultation and final report to be brought to council.There are eight systems, all of which are operated by Police Scotland, in Duns, Eyemouth, Galashiels, Hawick, Kelso, Melrose, Peebles and Selkirk.Scottish Borders Council is currently spending pound, a year repairing the systems, and officers have advised councillors that this will continue until the CCTV cameras are ldquobeyond economic repair.Police Scotland have also confirmed that although they view the CCTV systems as a valuable resource, they will not be providing funding for their maintenance.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer has thrown his weight behind the motion.He said: ldquoCCTV plays a vital role is helping prevent and solve crime and I find it completely incomprehensible that decisions that impact the safety, health and well-being of our communities can be taken without a full and complete assessment of the consequences.ldquoOnly this week we have learned how CCTV has helped detected a serious crime in one Borders town.ldquoThis motion follows a refusal of the councilrsquos chief executive to allow the original report to be procedurally

cyclists.Several Borders bobbies have saddled up as part of the nationwide campaign.Operation Close Pass was launched after research found many drivers are unaware that by passing to close to a cyclist, they can gain up to three points on their licence.Police will ditch the unorm and don bike-mounted cameras in attempt to catch drivers who get too close for comfort over the coming weeks.They will radio aheada driver passes too close and offenders will be pulled over for a warning.Inspector Richard Latto of the Lothians and Scottish Borders Road Policing Unit said: ldquoThe safety of all road users, especially those in the vulnerable category, remains a priority for Police Scotland and Operation Close Pass is one way we can educate and inform road users of the necessary passing space for cyclists.ldquoRural roads can present additional challenges, such as changing road conditions, dferences in speed limits, narrower roadways and changes in weather conditions.ldquoWersquod encourage all road users to share the road space responsibly whilst adhering to appropriate speeds within the limits.With  official bicycle routes in  locations, it is clear to see why cyclists love the Scottish Borders.However, they cannot always hear traffic behind them due to rushing wind and accidents can easily occurmotorists donrsquot respect the highway code.Gary Robson, owner of Bspoke cycles in Peebles, told us that close passing is a frequent hazard for cyclists.He said: ldquoImagine that the bike you are about to pass is a mother with a pram or a horse and rider.ldquoYoursquore going to slow down and show respect by passing at a safe enough distance.ldquoWhen drivers start to think of bike riders as sons, daughters, parents, grandparents and not just as bikes then we will all be able to share the road safely.Police Scotlandrsquos recent survey found  percent of people asked were not aware that close passing was a practice resulting in three penalty points.Consisting of over  Scottish men and women the poll showed most were unaware of the consequences of failing to leave a carrsquos width of space when overtaking a cyclist.In the Scottish Borders cycling accidents occur fairly regularly on Borders roads - and there have been fatalities in the past decade.Cyclists in groups have taken to riding two a breast on the road in order to use up the same space as a vehicle forcing the motorists to slow down and wait until it is safe to overtake.This method has not been free of criticism however as motorists often find it dficult to overtake two cyclists safely rather than give one bike more room.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: ldquoThe Scottish Borders welcomes tens of thousands of cyclists every year who are here to enjoy some of the best on and off-road cycling that Scotland has to offer.ldquoAs well as local cyclists and cycling groups, we fully support Cycling Scotland and Police Scotland in raising awareness of the risks to riders and the penalties for drivers who overtake too closely.\"Belles on Bikes is a Scottish initiative set up for women to cycle together socially.They have  independent groups across Scotland run by volunteers who are passionate about helping women enjoy cycling and feel safe.One member of the Scottish Borders branch is Brenda Mitchell, a senior partner at Cycle Law Scotland, which is based in Peebles.Brenda told us: ldquoClose passing is incredibly dangerous and there is a huge need for the campaign in every region of Scotland.ldquoOne incident springs to mind involving an elderly male who was overtaken by an HGV far too closely catching the cyclist with the backdraft resulting in him crashing and injuring his clavicle.ldquoWith those incidents you have to remember the highway code as a motorist must give as much room to a cyclist as they would a car.ldquoIt is a super initiative as it focusses on educating drivers as cycling in the Borders has become such a popular activity.ldquoHowever, I find the drivers in the Borders more courteous on average, as most leave the acceptable distance when overtaking.ldquoAs cycling is so big in the Borders, many drivers know how it feels to be on both sides of the wheel and take the necessary steps to make cyclists feel safe.ldquoRespecting one another when sharing road space is key as cyclists also have a duty to be courteous towards drivers.With the tenth year of the TweedLove Bike Festival next month, and Tour orsquo the Borders ing for a third year, cycling tourism in the Borders is continuing to grow.Thanks to Border Buses and the Borders Railway becoming accessible for bike users, people from all over Scotland can travel to the Borders for a dayrsquos cycling in a more energy efficient way.Brenda added: ldquoAs people are becoming more aware of global warming issues, they know it is a good idea to cycle shorter distances instead of driving.ldquoHowever, many people are put off getting on their bikes for fear of their safety.ldquoTherefore, I want to congratulate Police Scotland on raising awareness and educating drivers so that they are unlikely to

engineering study into its feasibility.In neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton, community councillors are keen to see the masterplan, which does not support a cruise port, adopted by the local authority.It sets out a range of ideas for the site, including the potential for a marina at the waterfront, business and economic sectors, and recreational land.Despite the investment into producing the masterplan and consulting the public, the only definite project confirmed for the site so far is an unmanned substation, which will bring offshore energy onto land for Inch Cape Offshore Ltd .ICOL, which are owned by Chinese State-owned company Red Rock, was granted permission for the substation after the Scottish Ministers called in its planning application shortly after East Lothian Council bought the land.The council confirmed earlier this month that is had agreed to sell part of the land to ICOL.A bid by local group the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust to buy part of the land for its own heritable project has been rejected by the council.The council told the trust it had been advised against selling until ldquosuch time as the future of the whole site has been determined.Signs promoting the land for development are expected to go up on the site within the next few weeks after they were given planning approval.They will invite all enquiries about

Finally, after what always seems a long wait, the land is alive and the evenings are long.The colours of this time are a big part of the joy. The blossom and explosion of wild flowers really lts my mood and spirit.A big part of this, for me, is the dandelion. Itrsquos a wild flower which decorates almost everywhere at the moment, creating a carpet of yellow which then transforms into white puffballs of flying lsquowishesrsquo.So many people just see this flower as an annoying weed to be mowed away as soon as it rears its head, but I love the way it keeps cheekily popping up in defiance of our attempts to keep nature at bay. Itrsquos one of our native wild flowers and causes no damage like some real invasive plants can, such as rhododendron.And they benefit our wildle so much. Bees and butterflies feed on them and some birds eat the seeds. But the benefits of the dandelion to humans has also long been recognised.A tea-like drink can be made from the roots and leaves or florets. There are dferent recipes, as the whole plant is edible. You can even make dandelion wine.The sap also contains healing properties which help with a range of ailments, especially skin complaints and issues related to digestion. In fact, herbalists will tell you of a range of health benefits attributed to the dandelion, which is packed with antitoxins and vitamins.And, of course, there are many folklore traditions associated with the flower.One I was reminded of this week when introducing the flower to a class of school children was the belief that you will wet the bedyou touch the petals! There is a small truth in this, as eating the leaves may have a diuretic effect.Making a wish and then blowing the parachute-like wisps which carry the seeds is the stuff of my childhood.Make the wish in secret and the wisps will carry it and help make it true. It is said they can also carry thoughts and love to someone you are missing or thinking about.Other uses include finding out how much you are loved, how many children you may have, or how many years you have left!The dandelion can even forecast the weather, as the puffball will close in on itselfit turns dreich. Another name for it is the lsquoshepherdrsquos clockrsquo, because its flower opens soon after sunrise and closes before the sun sets.And so this week I brought some dandelions into classrooms in a school where I am storytelling.Before I introduced the flowers, I gave them a riddle: ldquoA lion that has no roar, with teeth that do not bite, children who fly away, once yellow has turned to white. They eventually got the answer.The name dandelion, it is believed, comes from the French term lsquodent de lionrsquo meaning lionrsquos tooth, a reference to the teeth-shaped leaves.Then we blew the lsquowishesrsquo in the classroom. I was quite taken with the sense of wonder the children displayed . Many of them caught and kept the lsquowishesrsquo for later. It was so simple, yet so magic.ldquoHave you got more  I was asked.ldquoTherersquos plenty outside you can pick at home time, I told them.But as I left the school, I noticed the road verge I had picked the flowers had just been mowed. All the dandelions were gone, along with the other wild flowers, and it looked lsquonice and neatrsquo.Maybewe paused for a moment to wonder at how amazing this simple and common flower is, and the benefits it gives, we would have a dferent attitude towards it.Eating hand-picked and hand-washed dandelion leaves is one way my children will eat greens. If I mix them into a stir fry, they will be eaten too. These flowers are not just an irritating weed, they are one of naturersquos gts.As I left the school at the end of the day, a child came up to me.ldquoLook, I have a wish I caught, he said, as he carefully unfurled his hand. ldquoIrsquom going to use it to send my love to my granddad."},{"url":null,"title":"work-set-to-start-to-restore-dunbar-east-beach-to-its-former-glory","story":"The once-picturesque sandy beach has lost huge amounts of sand to the tides in recent years.Now, planning permission has been given for a scheme which aims to reinvigorate the beach, which used to be a magnet for tourists.Groynes, a breakwater and rock armour are included in the proposal, which was highlighted by ward councillor Norman Hampshire at a meeting of Dunbar Community Council.Mr Hampshire, the local authorityrsquos spokesman for environment, told the Courier: ldquoWe have been working on this project for some time, trying to get a method where we can attract sand back onto the beach again.ldquoThe consultants who have been looking at it have taken some time to come up with this option: a redesign of the groyne and two breakwaters to prevent [the damage caused] when we have a large sea coming in it damages the main wall and drags sand off the beach.

This was because I had never done it before. I canrsquot quite believe this myself that Irsquove left it to my late s to finally make the conquest.How many times I have said to myself, and my family, as we explored dferent parts of East Lothian, ldquowe must climb North Berwick Law someday as its distinctive shape loomed into view. Itrsquos a hill visible from so many places, just asking to be explored, but I always seemed to put it off. But finally I have done it.Itrsquos a huge pile of igneous rock, basically cooled and solidied lava, a remnant of ancient volcanic activity. Itrsquos a giant plug on a now-extinct volcanic vent. Folklore tradition has a very dferent origin for the hill, as I have already written about.When you stand at the base of the Law and peer up, you can see where the great glaciers of the Ice Age have scraped and polished the hillrsquos surface, making it quite rugged and craggy in places, and smoothed down in others. Itrsquos  feet high, not a mountain by any definition, yet still impressive. If it were in a hilly area we would notice the Law less, but it looms up from flatter landscape, right next to the sea, and so demands attention.No wonder it became a place of human settlement in the Iron Age period. How could you not use this hill as a location for a fort  Its steep, rocky braes are perfect for defence, itrsquos next to the sea with a ldquoview of the whole world, as my four-year-old put it ndash and was not entirely wrong!Cast your eye to the north and across the Firth was the land of the Picts. The open sea can be seen to the north east and almost the entire of East Lothian is laid out before you, to the Lammermuirs in the south and the Pentlands in the west.Here was the land of the Gododdin, the Celtic people who lived in our country when the Romans arrived, although they had a dferent name for them: the Votadini. They survived the Roman presence, perhaps entering into some alliance to preserve their tribe. The Romans were ruthless with those who did not co-operate and submit.But later, in the seventh century, long after the Romans had gone, the Angles arrived from the south. The Gododdin resisted the invasion. The great early poem Y Gododdin tells us of a great assemblage of warriors who feasted at Edinburgh before heading south to their deaths in battle.What wailing and sadness there must have been when the news of the loss of all those young, handpicked warriors arrived. The Goddodinsrsquo fate was soon sealed, the Angles took control of the land and the Lothians became part of the Northumbrian kingdom. The remnants of the disposed Gododdin migrated to Wales, it seems, taking with them their stories and legends of what became known as lsquothe old northrsquo.These were my thoughts as I found the remains on an old round house as we climbed to the summit of the Law. At first I wasnrsquot sure ndash it looked almost like a small standing stone circle ndash but on closer examination I realised the stones were the foundations of a Celtic round house. An archaeologist friend later confirmed this.There are at least  Iron Age round houses or similar structures so far discovered on the Law some are less obvious. Butyou carefully study the ground as you ascend, evidence of these ancient homes can be seen. There is also evidence of old walls or ramparts.So here a community of the Gododdin once lived. From their front doors they could see their sister forts of Dun Penderbut now named Traprain Law, and Din Eidyn, later to be called Edinburgh.So I entered the circle of stones as my kids played on a rock nearby. I was now in a space where once a family might have lived. It was not large, but then again, why would it be  It was a place to sleep and sit round the fire together.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

Over the year, the condition of  natural features improved to favourable or recovering condition, while  deteriorated to unfavourable condition.There is little that can be done to reverse some of the sites in trouble, at least at a local level. That is because they are the result of global environmental change, such as declining seabird populations which are thought to be related to changes in prey distribution. Climate change is also believed to be a factor in the decline of a number of sites and poses a long-term threat to Scotlandrsquos nature.However, the SNH report, which coincides with Invasive Species Week, shows that ldquoaliens remain the single biggest reason for features being in unfavourable condition, representing % of all negative pressures, followed by overgrazing .Not all ldquoinvasive species are necessarily foreign . Gorse, bracken and nettles, which occur naturally in Scotland, can be just as destructive as non-native plants and animals such as giant hogweed.They can hurt important habitats and the flora and fauna they support by competing for nutrients and light.SNH has been working with partners across Scotland to address these and other pressures and put important natural sites on the road to recovery.Sally Thomas, SNH Director of People and Nature, said: ldquoItrsquos encouraging to see that the majority of natural features in Scotland are either in good condition or on the road to recovery.ldquoHowever, these findings also clearly illustrate the challenges that nature faces and we know that more needs to be done.ldquoThatrsquos why we are working closely with partners, farmers and landowners to help them to manage sites in a way that tackles invasive species and overgrazing on protected areas and ensures that our natural heritage is safeguarded for future generations.Examples of this work in action include Lower Wick River Site of Special Scientic Interestin Caithness where the control of toxic giant hogweed is making headway, preventing the plants from flowering and resulting in a signicant decline in their numbers, and Ballantrae Shingle Beach SSSI in South Ayrshire, which is also improving following the treatment of invasive Japanese knotweed at the site.At Dumbrock Loch Meadows SSSI a management agreement with the landowner of the largest lowland grassland in Stirlingshire has resulted in better managed grazing, bracken treatment and the removal of Japanese knotweed.Meanwhile at Cleugh SSSI in Dumfries and Galloway the condition of the grassland is recovering following a similar management agreement, one of hundreds, to reduce grazing pressure and remove encroaching scrub and thistles - allowing flowering plants to thrive.SNH is also leading the four-year partnership Scottish Invasive Species Initiativeproject, which is working to control invasive non-native species along riversides in Northern Scotland.SNHrsquos recently announced Bioersity Challenge Fund of up to pound million is also targeting funding at projects that will help our most at-risk habitats and species, connect existing nature reserves and protected areas and tackle invasive species.Not everyone is happy.

Before the Second World War it was quite a staple of the basic school curriculum, but that is no longer the case.ldquoThere is good Scottish history available the further you go up when people specialise in history in secondary school, but making sure everyone gets the basics is no longer a priority as it used to be.Mr Pittock said the trend dated back to what he described as a ldquoslow redefinition of British history in the s and s as not being about all the countries of the British Isles, but being more about English history ldquowith some bits on.ldquoIf you compare the Empire Exhibition of  with the Festival of Britain  the former has got quite a lot of independent coverage of Scotland and the latter does not.Read more:Schools in poorer areas of Glasgow not offering languagesldquoThe reaction to the end of the British Empire with more of a focus on an integrated narrative of who the British were, rather than an understanding of the multiple nations involved, had a lot of consequences from Walter Scott dropping off the curriculum in English schools to Scottish history taking a back seat in Scotland.Mr Pittock said the teaching of Scottish history increasingly became ldquoa matter of chance as the trend embedded itself through the work of key curriculum and exam bodies.ldquoThe general trend was that Scottish education absorbed the idea of a unitary British history and this was embraced by Scottish educational bureaucracy.In recent years, Scottish history has made something of a comeback. There is now a compulsory Scottish question in the history Higher and Scottish Studies has been introduced as part of the Curriculum for Excellence.However, Mr Pittock is concerned that for many people television and film still provides them with their understanding of their own history.ldquoOne of the reasons why there has been such a fuss about films like Braveheart is because it is the way too many people get their history.ldquoPeople should not get all their history through drama. Outlaw King happens to be academically advised and is done to a pretty high standard, but there are a lot of things in it you could question.ldquoA lot of these productions are not historically accurate. They are entertainment and liberties are taken with the facts so people are left with a  understanding.ldquoThe answer is to ensure the widespread teaching of Scottish literature and history in Scottish primary schools and in the early years of secondary school.ldquoBut one of the most important aspects of this is to stop making it a political issue asthis is a Nationalist agenda is totally wrong. It is not propaganda it is the history of Scotland and people should be learning about it in the same way people in other countries learn about and take ownership of their own history.Stuart Jarman, general manager of the Edinburgh Dungeon, said the attraction was conscious of the importance of teaching history in an ldquoentertaining and edgy way.He said: ldquoOur shows are based on solid historical research and we know from our visitors, including school groups and teachers, that they find this thrilling."},{"url":null,"title":"us-bid-to-oust-board-at-scots-bus-and-rail-giant","story":"Activist investor Coast Capital, which has built up its stake in FirstGroup to . per cent, has accused the current leadership of presiding over a ldquotrack record of value destruction and under-performance at the Aberdeen headquartered firm.:Transport giant faces demand for leadership cullAnd it raised the prospect of selling off parts of the group in order to ldquocreate value for shareholders, employees and pensioners.

The basis for a referendum was well-documented in .Askedit is, therefore, up to the UK Parliament to decide the limits of devolution, Mr Mundell tells The Herald: ldquoI donrsquot recognise the way in which you are construing that because devolution means that certain matters are the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament, so like education and health, these are almost a full responsibility.ldquoI put through orders in this Parliament to ensure that policies I donrsquot agree with in Scotland are in force free prescriptions, I didnrsquot agree with that policy at that time.

All of these additional powers and responsibilities it is taking on or will eventually take on, when the Scottish Government can get round to dealing with them, we need to see that dferentiation so people think the Parliament is dferent from the people who are running the Government.The Scottish Secretary admits that the Conservatives, who vehemently opposed devolution before the  referendum fearing a Yes vote could break up the Union, should have been quicker to accept the new settlement, which was voted for by nearly  per cent of Scotland on a  per cent turnout.He claims the Tories made a ldquoperfectly legitimate case in opposing devolution but ldquoonce it had become clear it was the settled will of the Scottish people, that it was going to happen, it would have been better to have accepted that earlier.Sir John Curtice: Devolution was supposed to kill nationalism stone dead - its very much aliveMr Mundell, who has held his Cabinet post since , goes on: ldquoI always pay tribute to David McLetchie[the late Scottish Conservative leader] because what he did was as a leader he took us into that Parliament and acted in a combative but a constructive way and the  Tory MSPs who were elected in  and all their successors have always embraced and worked for that Parliament and for devolution.

The smoking ban was probably the biggest challenge to orthodoxy that took place and I commend the Parliament for that decision.ldquoSince [when the SNP took power] the constitution has ultimately dominated, he complains, claiming the Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon administrations have held back the development of Scottish devolution.ldquoEducation is the biggest indictment, declares Mr Mundell. ldquoIf,  years ago as we took our oath, people would have said after  years of this Parliament there would be more young people leaving school without any qualications at all, people would have been stunned.ldquoThey believed as I did that this Parliament was about enhancing and taking forward Scottish education and its traditions and its dferences and making it even better and that has not happened.ldquoI put a large part of that down to  years when the Scottish Parliament has spent focusing entirely on and such a big part of its emotional effort on the constitution. Itrsquos unfulfilled.When it is pointed out how the Tories bang on about the possibility of Scottish independence because the constitution is just as good electorally and politically for them as it is for the SNP, Mundell says: ldquoI can make a commitment right now thatNicola Sturgeon takes independence and another referendum off the table, Irsquoll stop speaking about it. I can give that absolute commitmenthellip Two weeks ago, the First Minister set out how there has to be another referendum, she wants to have a bill and Citizensrsquo Assemblies. I donrsquot want to have any of those things.But The Herald points out Ms Sturgeon and her colleagues would never take independence off the table and he knows it given the SNPrsquos raison drsquoetre is to campaign for an independent Scotland.He adds: ldquoThe SNPrsquos route to independence used to be they would deliver good government people will think we have done such a good job, we should be given the whole responsibility. That has been abandoned because their record on domestic issues has been so poor."},{"url":null,"title":"man-ordered-to-tear-down-boathouse-he-built-for-dinghy","story":"Brian Steven, , constructed the building at West Loch Tarbert in Argyll. He used it to store sailing equipment and to launch his dinghy and also allowed local residents access to the facility.But he failed to apply for council planning permission and has now been told the isolated hut will have to come down before the end of the year. Mr Steven, of Tarbert, erected the remote unit three years ago after retiring to the area with his we.He told planners the boathouse was to be used as a launch pad for sailing his boat off the west coast of Scotland.He was told by Argyll and Bute Council the building was unauthorised but applied for retrospective planning permission.That was thrown out, but he took his fight to the Scottish Government, who have now sided with the council and ordered he knock it down.The council argued the timber building had a lsquosevere detrimentrsquo to the landscape, but Mr Steven insisted it was in such a remote location that it had no effect on the environment.He said: ldquoThe use of term ldquoto the severe detriment of the landscape quality again is subjective and seems designed to increase the negative aspects of the building.ldquoIt cannot be seen from any public areas, nor adjacent dwelling homes, nor the passing ferry traffic.ldquoIt requires further substantiation as to how it can be described as ldquosevere detriment.For example, we can understand the use of ldquosevere detrimentthe hut were placed in the middle of George Square in Glasgow or beside the castle on the top of the hill in Tarbert.ldquoIt seems inappropriate to apply such strong language in terms of this small hut and its modest, remote surroundings. It is a small hut, after all.Mr Steven added: ldquoWe really cannot see who or what is currently being harmed by the hut, we are open to any suggestions which would not result in the ultimate removal of this storage facility for all our boating paraphernalia and deprive the residents of Nether Auchans of a valued asset.ldquoNo one gains from its removal and at least five incoming families to the area would suffer.ldquoWe regret hugely the amount of time, effort and money on the part of ourselves, the council and the Scottish Government, this innocuous, innocent and relatively minor issue is causing. It is embarrassing.ldquoWe have made our lives here. From the degree of challenge and lack of pragmatism we have met, it is impossible to feel anything other than disappointed and unwelcome by an overly bureaucratic, inappropriate application of a process designed to protect our environment from infinitely greater threats than our storage shed.In a written ruling, government reporter Malcolm Mahony said: ldquoMr Steven explains that he built his present home at Nether Auchans primarily because the loch provided excellent summer mooring with a slipway for dinghy access.ldquoThe council argues that the building has the domestic character and appearance of ancillary residential structure, and would normally relate visually and ally to the curtilage of a residential dwelling house.ldquoHowever, it is beyond any residential curtilage and outwith the appellantrsquos ownership. It is inappropriate to, and visually incongruous within the sensitive, open and undeveloped landscape, and the isolated coastal location.ldquoMr Stevens has offered to further screen or adapt the building and its immediate area. I am satisfied that any such steps would not be sufficient.ldquoI agree with the council that the building has the appearance of an ancillary residential structure, inappropriate in this isolated location and to its declared purpose.Mr Steven has been given six months to complete the demolition work."},{"url":null,"title":"david-mundell-only-found-out-he-had-become-an-msp-by-clicking-on-teletext","story":"He had failed to take the Dumfries seat but was on the Conservative PR list for Holyrood.:David Mundell: There will not be a Scottish independence referendum before ldquoI was number four on the Conservative list, which wasnrsquot really a position I thought I would be elected from, admits the Scottish Secretary. ldquoBut the count was delayed and there was some issue in the borders, so at am there was no concept of when a regional result would be declared and I just decided to go home.ldquoI wasnrsquot very confident of my prospects and then when I woke up later in the morning - nobody had phoned me or anything like that ndash I was just flickering through Teletext to see what all the other results were.

Gradually, the system clicked in and there was more process and procedure.Of course, Holyrood had to dferentiate itself from Westminster. ldquoWe tried to do everything dferently from the voting to the chamber everything had to be dferent.Mr Mundell says the new parliament was not like the Commons. ldquoThere was a greater camaraderie and affinity across members, particularly when everyone had arrived, it was new and it was a very exciting time. The hope and anticipation was tangible.But that did not last long as political enmity started to kick in.ldquoThe partisanship you see now, itrsquos very polarised now. At that period, we had a majority government, which no one ever anticipated and what you had as well, although you had a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition, the Liberals had quite a lot of wild cards in that people like Donald Gorrie and John Farquhar Munroe, Labour had people like John MacAllion. These people couldnrsquot be relied to vote along the party line. So, the Government lost in committees.Of course, Mr Mundell has begun something of a political dynasty with his son Oliver now also an MSP the first father-and-son combination.He recalls taking his son to the glittering opening ceremony. ldquoOliver was nine or  at the opening ceremony.

It has hardly been a seismic change, particularly given that % of UK children are educated by the state. But anything that takes account of the fact that three Bs from a socially disadvantaged child who cares for a sick parent might be worth the same as three As from a wealthy child whose parents invested in ongoing tuition has got to be a positive step on the road to social equality.Or so you would think. The problem is that some private-school parents, who have paid through the nose to ensure their child can tap into the type of privilege an Oxbridge education iniably brings, have cried foul, blaming social engineering on behalf of those further down the hierarchy of power for their own child missing out.There is a clear irony in the idea that social engineering could be working against any student educated at an Oxbridge feeder school, when school ties rather than academic achievement have often been enough to secure places in the past. Even the chair of the Independent Schools Council admitted as much when he noted that ldquoindependent schools report that their marginal candidates no longer tend to get into Cambridge but their good candidates are as successful as ever. Heaven forbid that those bright enough,not rich enough, might be successful too.Such attitudes are nothing new, with members of dominant groups regularly playing the discrimination card when they feel minorities are encroaching on their patch. Back in  Jonathan Sumption, then a Supreme Court judge who got his own break in law thanks to the intervention of a family friend, huffed that measures to improve the woeful lack of gender ersity in the judiciary ldquocould have appalling consequences for justice because they might ldquomake male candidates feel that the cards are stacked against them. Similarly, the BBC faced accusations of discriminating against whites when, in , it sought to make its newsroom more representative of the population it serves by making a traineeship open to black, Asian or non-white ethnic minority applicants only.While those making such arguments say they fear that bright-enough rich kids and talented-enough white men will lose out to less-bright poor kids or less-talented minorities, what they really fear is that long-established power imbalances may be tipping out of their favour. For them, the prospect of equality is a scary one.It neednrsquot be. Just as no privately educated student smart enough to study at Oxbridge has anything to fear from a state-educated pupil who is smart enough too, no man cut out for high office needs be afraid of missing out to a woman who has also got what it takes. Thatrsquos the beauty of equality: it would make room for everyone deserving of a place.The problem with the knee-jerk reactions of those who fear losing out, those who cry discrimination from their established positions of power, is that it can have very real consequences for those who are already being discriminated against because the balance of power remains so unequal.Take Glasgow. Last week the city councilrsquos licensing committee threw out an application for a female-only taxi business on the basis that it would discriminate against men. Though the vast majority of taxis in the city are driven by men, a reality that some women find intimidatory, the council baulked at the idea of female passengers being able to choose only female drivers and female drivers being matched only with female fares.Committee convenor Alex Wilson, the SNP member for Cardonald, opposed the plan on the basis that ldquothe whole not picking up male passengers is a concern to me while, in a rare show of unity across the political ide, Conservative member Robert Connolly said the idea of a service run by women for women ldquois essentially sexism towards males.Their words shame them. Sexism, just like any other form of discrimination, works because one party - men - has more power than another - women. Some men choose to wield that power through sex attacks and violence, and it is not discriminatory for women to want to protect themselves from that.Sure it would be a pain for a man to have to wait a few minutes to catch a ride home, just like it would be galling for an Oxford-bound student to have to settle for Bristol University instead. But unless and until we live in a world where all things are equal, theyrsquore really not in a position to complain."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-extremist-brexit-party-is-not-the-voice-of-leave-voters","story":" No Deal was overwhelmingly defeated in Parliament.

The only connection with Scotland seems to be the word \"Scotland\" printed on the front.Scotland was split down the middle in the independence referendum, voting  , a result likely to be replicated should Nicola Sturgeon be foolish enough to try again. But in other ways, Scotland is not ided. Scotland supports having its own parliament. Scotland wants to stay in the EU.What Scotland does not like is interlopers who try to take advantage. The latest in the long line of people who think Scots are daft and can be taken for a ride is the Brexit Party. Its election document shows three candidates, one from London, one from Lowestoft, the other from Sussex. Two other candidates are a property developer and a CEO of a property company.The Brexit party is masquerading as a party for the common man, whereas it is nothing of the sort. It is a right-wing party stuffed full of disaffected Tories. The last time Nigel Farage came to Edinburgh, he had to be rescued by the police. Time to send this banker packing, back to the City of London, without the votes he needs to keep on the gravy train.Phil Tate,Edinburgh.ANDREW Marr was quite right to question Nigel Farage about the policies a Farage-led or influenced government would adopt and to quote previous comments on issues such as immigration, NHS and smaller government. After all, he claims the EU election would herald the end of two-party government so these questions are hardly irrelevant.Sadly, Marrs robust and persistent line only seems to be reserved for certain iniduals or parties and not the likes of Nicola Sturgeon, who iniably gets off with an approach only a few notches above asking what her favourite colour is.

Yet the composition of our parliament is much more reflective of the votes cast, than Westminster is. The SNPis the most popular Scottish party with the public. It is a centrist, social democrat party, yet cannot find a partner for a coalition among the others. It is surely ironic that the Big Two are now both ldquoseparatist when it comes to one union, yet refuse to form any partnership with the SNP because of its ldquoseparatism toward another union. The Scottish LibDems  I honestly have no idea what role they wish to play in Scotland, other than costing the public a fortune in Freedom of Information requests.But we should have concerns over the distancing of the elected from the electorate. It is as a result of the Brexit debacle, and that is being reflected in the fracturing of decades-old voting habits in England . The main UK parties appear to be shedding much of their core vote, and with a first past the post electoral system, this should raise concerns about the ability of any party having a ldquostrong and stable government in the future.

Fergusson and deputy presiding officers Trish Godman and Alasdair Morgan are pictured with the July , , babies who visited Parliament for its th birthday. It is hoped they willfor the th celebrations. “But it was a joyful day the crowds turned out in force and we had the weather to go with it. “I was able to enjoy it once the hard work was done.“I remember walking down the Royal Mile, once the crowds had dissipated. Even then, I realised it was a once in a letime day.”There are many memorable occasions Paul can recall but one meeting in particular stands out.“There was a breakfast meeting attended by Martin McGuinness and Ian Paisley,” he said. “Martin helped Ian to his feet and they walked across the garden lobby of the Parliament together.“As someone who followed Irish politics, I had to pinch myself. For that to have happened here in the Scottish Parliament – it’s a tremendous memory.“It was so symbolic and a reminder that even the strongest adversaries can come together.”One act of legislation is also lodged in Paul’s mind.“When the same sex marriage act was passed, there was a sense of jubilation in all parties and across Parliament,” he said.In his  years, Paul has been invited to breakfast at Bute House just once.But that breakfast will also live long in his memory.He added: “In , I was responsible for helping to run the referendum which saw the Parliament being re-established in Scotland.“It was a day of great anxiety but it had gone well, with only a few technical hitches – in a time when a fax machine was state of the art!“I finished work at am and got invited to Bute House for breakfast with Donald Dewar, Henry McLeish and Sam Galbraith.“One of my best memories is enjoying breakfast with them, while reflecting on what had been a great night for them politically and a great night for us too.“I’ve never been invited back for breakfast since – but you never know, it is the th anniversary this year!”The Parliament’s current presiding officer Ken Macintosh was one of the newbies in .Until being elected to represent Eastwood in , he was a BBC television producer, working on national news programmes.But encouraged by his we Claire, he sought election to the Parliament as a Labour Party candidate.Despite claiming not to be a career politcian, he was re-elected in ,  and . And in  he was elected as an MSP for West Scotland and became Presiding Officer.The eldest of their six children, Douglas, is  this month so  was a busy year for the Macintosh clan!He recalled: “It was a very exciting time in my le. “Claire and I had just got married a year before and our son was born five days before I was elected.“So it was exciting but slightly worrying as my we thought she’d married this sensible man, with a senior position in the BBC.“Then suddenly I was giving it all up for politics. “At the time, it was a little bit of a gamble from someone who is not a gambler!“But Claire encouraged me to stand. That was all the endorsement I needed.”Ken was more used to posing questions than being asked them but it was a relatively easy transition.He explained: “Whether it is reporting on current events or trying to shape them, it’s a reflection of the same set of interests.“I’d been a member of the Labour Party since I was a student but never, ever stood for an elected office.“But I was a big supporter of devolution and it was really that that made me put myself forward.“The whole idea of doing politics in a dferent way, having a erse group of voices, that was what grabbed me.“I used to be the person shouting questions at the Prime Minister which stood me in good stead. To become the person being shouted at was quite odd though!”Ken recalls the early days with great pride.“It’s dficult for people now to recall the air of excitement it was an era of real change,” he said.“Then there was a big backlash due to the cost of the building and politically some very dficult issues.“Section  was the one I remember very vividly. It was a confrontation of the old Scotland with the new.“The Scotland I was brought up in was not the tolerant, progressive country it is today...it was certainly not an easy country to be gay in.“Section  confronted that head on.”Another milestone for Ken was the smoking ban.“When I was a kid, people always talked about Scotland having the worst cancer record in Europe,” he said.“And here we were taking control of our own health.“We were criticised for being the nanny state but I still think of it as a statement of our self-confidence.“When I first started, the Parliament made videos and I was asked what my ambitions for Scotland were and who my heroes were. “My heroes were Kenny Dalglish and Elvis Presley. I’ve since met Kenny and he didn’t disappoint!“I also wanted Scotland to be more self-confident and the smoking ban was a sign of that.”Now,  years on, the Parliament has become the centre of public le.Ken added: “At the start, so many people were openly hostile and condescending about the Parliament. “It’s testament to the people of Scotland that they’ve since embraced it and made it their own.”Tracing babies who share Parliament’s birthdayA new exhibition will take centre stage in the Parliament for the th anniversary celebrations.

We have to look at this on the basis of the outcomes, not processes and will the Minister not accept that for the over s, the outcomes look pretty grim.”Responding on behalf of the Government, Margot James MP said: “I thank the Rt. Hon. Gentleman for his intervention and I am sure that the BBC will listen to the comments which he just made with which I have considerable sympathy. This was part of a fair deal for the BBC. At the time the BBC Director General, and I have already quoted him, that he did say also that it was a strong deal for the BBC and that it provided financial stability.”Adding further comment, Mr. Carmichael said: “It is easy to say you are sympathetic but still the Government is doing nothing to set it right. They have tried to duck responsibility by pushing it onto the BBC, but this is not about who is responsible, but what the impact is on the people who will be affected.“Over s are often on a low fixed pension, so to suddenly have an extra £ outgoing is a huge chunk of their income. Many older people are reliant on their TVs as a way of avoiding loneliness and stripping them of their TV Licence is likely to leave signicant numbers unable to watch their favourite programmes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There will be local support for farmers, who will be able to obtain immediate permission rather than having to apply for a specic, inidual licence, which can take around ten days.This local licence follows a new goose policy which supports efficient, practical regulation for farmers and others affected by geese grazing.Graham Neville, SNH’s Northern Isles  North Highland area manager, has said: “We realise that farmers in Orkney have been struggling with the impact of large goose numbers, and this pressure has been increasing. We’re keen to work with farmers and land managers and support them in finding sustainable solutions to managing this problem, while still making sure we fulfill our nature conservation obligations.“We have been working hard to look at ways to give farmers more flexibility. As a result, we plan to introduce a greylag goose licence for Orkney to cover the closed season from  February to  June.“For the long term, we will also be working with an extended local Goose Management Group, alongside partners in NFUS, RPID and others, to try to explore new ways of managing the problem. We will be funding and administering this through the local goose management group in Orkney.”SNH have been discussing potential management tools and the new licence with NFU Scotland representatives in Orkney. Alan Corrigall, chairman of the Orkney Branch, said: “We are grateful to SNH for making the changes that will allow shooting to take place throughout the year, where necessary. Whilst the new licence will not control geese numbers in itself, it will make much easier for those undertaking shooting to get the necessary consent between February and June.#We also look forward to working with SHN and others as we explore other ways to reduce the resident greylag goose population to lessen the environmental and economic impact of the huge numbers of geese.#Resident greylag geese in Orkney have increased over the past  years.

Otherwise, what’s the point So the current debate over whether the normal urban speed limit should be mph or mph is a matter of degree, rather than principle. Where should the compromise between safety and speed be made The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, which supports mph, points to research saying that  per cent of pedestrians killed in accidents with cars and vans died when the impact speed was less than mph, while just five per cent of deaths occurred below mph.However, other research found that an astonishing  per cent of car drivers break the speed limit on mph roads, compared to  per cent on mph roads, which gives a fairly good indication of what most motorists think about the lower limit.: ‘Very harsh’ – Edinburgh reacts as  drivers caught breaking mph limitAs we report today, Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said in a letter to the charity Sustrans: “Changing a speed limit does not guarantee that actual vehicle speeds will change. The guidance on setting all speed limits is clear that they should be reasonable and consistentthey are to be credible to road users and obeyed as a result.”If a law is introduced, but not obeyed by a large number of people, then it risks being held in general contempt and simply ignored. The laws requiring the wearing of seatbelts and banning smoking in pubs were initially controversial, but were successful because they quickly became accepted as people realised they were actually beneficial.The signs from places such as Edinburgh where mph limits have been introduced are that there is considerable resistance to the idea. Police Scotland has also pointed out that enforcing this limit cannot be a priority for the force. A mph speed limit on some city streets may be appropriate, but it is clear the public still needs to be convinced.: Catching mph speeders ‘not a priority’ – Police Scotland©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"well done to snp for this great pro climate move dr richard dixon","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Last week#s decision to scrap the plans to first halve and then do away with Air Departure Tax was a great move in the right direction and exactly the kind of thing a country which has delcared a #Climate Emergency# should do.The airport industry whinged on, of course, but failed to mention there is no VAT on plane tickets and no tax or duty on aviation fuel – unlike the trains they compete with for UK and near-continent journeys. Flying is a growing contributor to climate change. Oneflight to the US creates about the same amount of climate pollution per passenger as the gas used to heat a house for a whole year. Reducing your consumption of meat and dairy produce and stopping flying are the two biggest things most of us can do to reduce our own personal contribution to climate change. Globally, the aviation industry is growing rapidly and is predicted to reach four times today’s climate emissions by . New planes are generally more efficient than older ones but growth in flights outstrips efficiency improvements by some distance, and many planes operate for  years before coming out of service.Fortunately we already include international flying in measuring our climate emissions and therefore in climate targets, although the current rules under-estimate the contribution of aviation by a factor of at least two.Some argue that businesses need cheap flights but, when asked, most businesses say they expect their employees to do less flying in the future. The businesses save money and get more productive time out of their staff, and the employees get to see more of their families.: Air tax: Scotland’s direct air link to China faces axeSome argue that tourism will sufferwe do not make flights cheaper. Tourism is doing pretty well already, with employment in the tourism sector growing by  per cent between  and . And cheaper flights might bring a some more people here but they will also encourage more people from Scotland to spend their holiday money somewhere .Unlike for cars, there is no easy technical solution in sight to make most flying low or zero carbon. There are some electric planes and Norway has a target to use electric planes for all short-haul flights. But that’s going to take until  and will still only be for short flights.There are those who suggest we can use fuels made from crops for flying, but replacing all that fossil aviation fuel with plant-based alternatives would hoover up vast areas of the world’s productive land and create a boom in already-destructive palm oil plantations.Keeping flying even as much as today would mean every other sector, from homes to farms, from factories to road transport, would have to reduce emissions even faster to meet climate targets. Youth climate activist Greta Thunberg’s makes very impressive speeches in a iety of languages all over Europe. She doesn’t fly, she takes the train. : Brian Wilson: Blowhard promises led to SNP’s air tax U-turnMany of the UK climate scientists who went to last year’s climate conference in Katowice made a point of going by train. The three of us from FoE Scotland who went also took the train. A growing number of people are shunning flying because of its impacts and there is a new no-flying movement in Sweden.Scrapping the scrapping of the Air Departure Tax was a great pro-climate decision. Very well done to the SNP for making it and defending it robustly.

It’s the most outrageous proposal I’ve ever seen.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"unemployment in scotland remains at record low","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Unemployment in Scotland remains at an historic low with official figures published today finding the country#s jobless rate is . per cent, below the UK-wide figure of . per cent.The latest labour market statistics from January-March found . per cent of those aged - living north of the Border were in work, a slight drop of . per cent on the previous three months.But the survey also found that  per cent of adult Scots remain economically inactive, a rise of . per cent.Year-on-year, the numbers in employment in Scotland have risen by . per cent, compared to the UK-wide increase of . per cent.The figures also showed Scotland’s growing digital tech sector employs a record , people.: SNP veteran ‘quit party after bitter clash with MPWelcoming the figures, Scottish secretary David Mundell said: “It is good news that unemployment in Scotland is at a record low, this really is to be celebrated.

We have the worst levels by a country mile.Figures assembled by the debt relief charity Step Change indicate that while the average Scottish mortgage debt is £,, in the constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch it is a whopping £,.Even within the Highlands as a whole that is a shocking sum # the Highland average of mortgage arrears is £,. That is almost twice the national average. But in Skye, we are told, our arrears are six times the national average, with almost a third of mortgage payers affected.We should introduce a note of caution. Step Change has extrapolated its conclusions from a small sample of the population. It is possible,not likely, that things are not quite that bad.Unless Step Change is completely off the chart, things are nonetheless bad enough. And our indebtedness extends beyond house payments. The Highlands and Islands have the highest levels of electricity bill arrears in Scotland, something which will be owed to our climate and our extortionate bills, and which has already been advertised by our uniquely high levels of fuel poverty.Overall, people in the Highlands and Islands are twice as much in debt as where in Scotland, and people in the north-west of Scotland are even more in hock to lenders and to utility companies.Those astonishingly high figures for mortgage debt # and therefore, of course, of potential foreclosures and homelessness # in this region cannot easily be explained away. It is the result of a combination of factors.House prices in Skye and the western Highlands began to rise, from a low base, in the s.The speed of growth took everybody by surprise. A simple crofthouse which in the early s might have sold for £, or less can now fetch ten times that amount.The selling price was dictated more by location than the quality of the property. At first the holiday home sector played the most active part in pushing up prices.Throw a st century tourist boom and all of its ancillary money spinners such as buy-to-let properties and Airbnb into the mix, add a resident population which has grown by  per cent since the s, and the result is a skewed and uncontrollable local housing market.It is a market into which local working people are obliged to enter. Everybody needs somewhere to live. Local housing associations have done a good job in offering affordable rented homes. Clearly, however, Skye and the north-west have never recovered from the Tory assault on local authority #council# housing in the s. In the absence of sufficient decent social housing, people have to buy.The result has been that young people, in particular, have been obliged to enter what is now one of the most expensive and volatile housing markets in the United Kingdom. Those same young people live in a region with some of the worst-paid and insecure jobs in the country.That is not a formula for a stable society. Low wages and high house prices, in a region where the general cost of living is also high, provides the perfect recipe for unsustainable levels of mortgage arrears, as well as unpaid electricity and other bills # and that is exactly what we have got.There are two obvious solutions. They will not be achieved overnight, but they should be pushed quickly up the agenda of all of our local businesses and elected representatives.It is clear that the tourism riches that have recently descended on Skye and the north-west are not evenly distributed. If we want people to stay and live and work here, they must be paid at least a living wage: a salary which will enable them to buy houses.And central and local government must invest much more in social housing. That will depend upon finance from the Scottish Government and the initiative of Highland Council. The £ million pledged this week by the former towards local authority housing is a good start. But there are  councils in Scotland. The money cannot be ided equally. Priority must be given to regions such as this which suffer most gravely from unaffordable housing.

Just as people come to the Clonard Novena, my family would have gone to the St Majella Novena every year over the generations, it’s a church that I know very well and love.”Fr Kehoe spoke of how there is great goodness in people “wherever you go” and how much he will miss the people he has got to know since first arriving at  Clonard Gardens in .“Clonard is very much inserted in this community, their pride and love for it is something I haven’t experienced anywhere .“People have the same struggles and dficulties. I will really miss Clonard, miss the people I got to know here. When the changes were published they were a bit of a shock.“Clonard is a church and faith community like no other. The people of Clonard are amazing, they are the most generous people I’ve ever met, they would literally go out of their way to help you in anyway they could.“I spent seven years in Cork learning to say things without actually saying them, when I came to Clonard there were no back doors. It was lovely to work with that, you knew where you stood with people.”While the sterling work of Fr Kehoe at Clonard is well appreciated by the local people, he is keen to point out that it takes a considerable team effort for Clonard to work.“I’m not sure people really understand just how big it is. There are over  people involved in Clonard, from our ministries, readers, Eucharist Ministers. Clonard has become a very signicant place for music and our director Cathal Murphy has really pushed that with our choirs and opening up Clonard as a venue for concerts.“Clonard’s name is out there, when you have such a beautul and sacred place at your disposal there are people coming to Clonard for music that may have never been before.”With preparations gathering pace for next month’s eagerly-awaited Novena, Fr Kehoe says he will take with him forever the “phenomenon” that the annual June festival of prayer has become.“You have -, people a day coming into the area. People are coming with huge burdens, you can see by the end that they are leaving feeling healed, supported and feeling that God is very close to them in their lives. I think at some stage all of us need that.Paying tribute to the faith of the people of Clonard, Fr Kehoe says he was amazed to find when he arrived at Clonard that there were three Christmas Vigil Masses.“I remember saying, ‘You can’t do that’ but it was a case of wait and see. Seeing the church packed with young families, seeing that sense of pure joy in the church, well, I will take that with me everywhere.“I have a real deep feeling of gratitude for the way people have welcomed me, the faith of West Belfast Catholics is second to none and I want to thank them for all their love and support.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"darkness into light","story":"AHEAD of this weekend’s highly anticipated Darkness Into Light walk all participants are being asked to be aware of the important parking information.Hannahstown Community Association and Lámh Dhearg would like to advise that the Darkness into Light route will be closed to all traffic from .am to .am.A long stay car park is available at the Lámh Dhearg carpark and will be open to walkers runners from am on Saturday May  and operated on a first come first served basis until .am.

After a warm welcome at reception wemade our way to our Executive room on the hotel’s first floor. The room was extremely spacious with a huge bathroom – a welcome slate of fresh fruit and bouquet of flowers was a wonderful touch.Over a cup of tea we were able to see more guests arrive throughout the afternoon who were accessing the hotel’s popular apartments and it was a quick change before heading out for dinner at Malone Lodge’s Kne and Fork Grill and Deli. The hotel’s restaurant is beautully laid-out with burgundy leather banquettes and ornate glass cases containing antique cutlery. Our sitting was for .pm and already there was a buzz in the restaurant with both couples and families celebrating birthdays and other special occasions. Once settled we had a look over Malone Lodge’s All Day Menu, which is served both in the main restaurant and Macklin’s lounge. Light bites included soup of the day, classic Caesar salad, chicken wings and beetroot and goat’s cheese salad. My partner and I decided to start things off with two servings of the goat’s cheese, which was delicious – pearls of tangy goat’s cheese were perfectly dressed accompanied by a scattering of caramelised walnuts and leaves.We surveyed a mouth-watering menu but it was a dish of chicken and chorizo carbonara served with a wedge of garlic bread and rocket that won out, along with a fillet of salmon with cockles, carrots, celery and lemon persillade sauce. My salmon main was a plump fillet with crispy skin sat atop a mound of creamy mash, green beans, roasted parsnip and caullower. Across the table the pasta was hailed a success. Generous side portions of onion rings and sweet potato fries ensured we had no room for dessert, tea or coffee but opted for a drink in the lounge where we promptly sank into one of their luxurious Queen-sized armchairs and did something we hadn’t done in a while – relax.The hotel staff in Malone Lodge are at the top of their game when it comes to going above and beyond to ensure your stay is a memorable one. This was further demonstrated at a very busy breakfast service the next morning. Nothing was too much trouble as we were guided to bowls of fresh fruit, granola, juices and toast with the option on offer to opt for something cooked to order.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

will need to include a second referendum in order to receive the backing of Labour MPs, Sir Keir Starmer has said..pushThe shadow Brexit secretary warned it was “impossible” to see how an agreement between the Conservatives and Labour could clear the Commons unless it guaranteed the deal would be put back to the public for a “confirmatory vote”.Sir Keir made the comments ahead of crunch talks between Cabinet ministers and senior Labour figures on Monday, although speculation was growing over whether the negotiations will succeed.Speaking to , the leading Labour negotiator said his colleagues and the party leadership would have to decide “in the coming days”it was worth continuing with the talks.I’ve made it clear that at this stage, at this th hour, any deal that comes through from this government ought to be subject to the lock of a confirmatory voteSir Keir StarmerMeanwhile, The Times reported that the Prime Minister has been urged by Cabinet ministers to pull out of the talks and move to indicative votes by MPs.Chancellor Philip Hammond is said to be among those who have lost faith with the plan to strike a cross-party deal, while on Sunday Education Secretary Damian Hinds expressed support for finding a “stable majority” by allowing MPs to vote on dferent options.In the wake of dire local election results for the Tories and Labour and looming European elections – which could see Nigel Farage’s newcomer Brexit Party make unprecedented gains – both parties are under pressure to make progress on Britain’s EU departure.“I’ve made it clear that at this stage, at this th hour, any deal that comes through from this government ought to be subject to the lock of a confirmatory vote,” Sir Keir said.The shadow minister said that “probably not ” of the party’s  MPs could vote against the deal unless it was linked to a second referendum.“If the point of the exercise is to get a sustainable majority, over several weeks or months of delivering on the implementation, you can’t leave a confirmatory vote out of the package,” he said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Theresa May is under pressure to make progress on Brexit Sir Keir signalled that Labour expects movement from the Government this week in order to keep the talks on track, telling the paper it “would be wrong in principle to use up much more time simply exploring each other’s positions”.“I do think we do probably in the coming days need to make that assessment.”The issue of a confirmatory referendum has been an internal battleground within Labour ranks, with Sir Keir pushing for one but shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, also part of the negotiating team, less keen.Sir Keir highlighted how the party lost  lost seats in this month’s council elections, which he said were a sign Labour was losing the trust of Remain as well as Leave voters.The party’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, is expected to call for a second vote in a speech on Monday.Mr Watson will reportedly invoke the late Labour leader John Smith, saying the heavyweight would have backed a “people’s vote as a way out of this destructive mess”.The Sun says Mr Watson will tell the Fabian Society that Mr Smith, who was tipped to become prime minister before his death  years ago, saw “anti-EU sentiment” as “wrong-headed”.The BBC reported that Mr Watson will “plead” with voters to back Labour in next week’s European Parliament elections, despite the party’s Brexit stance.“There are only two forces that can win this election – that nasty nationalism of the Farage Brexit Party, or the tolerant, compassionate outward-looking patriotism of the Labour Party,” he will say.I think well get an absolute maulingHuw Merriman, Conservative politicianA ComRes general election poll published on the weekend found Mr Farage’s Brexit Party had overtaken the Tories for the first time, taking a one-point lead.That level of support would see the Brexit Party win  seats, becoming the UK’s second biggest party after Labour, with .Speaking to the BBC Radio  Westminster Hour on Sunday night, the Chancellor’s parliamentary aide, Huw Merriman, said the Tories will suffer “an absolute mauling” in next week’s European Parliament elections.“The public will blame the Conservative government because we were the party that brought forward the referendum,” said Mr Merriman, who backs a second

Such a trail would link the arearsquos many tower houses, monasteries and other medieval sites. Local people are being invited to give their ideas on the trail and it might be enhanced through themed banquets, tapestry making, metal working, re-enactments, guided tours and other activities to encourage visitors to spend time in the area.This project is being supported and funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, Tourism NI and the Historic Environment Division of the Department for Communities. It has been developed as part of their European Year of Cultural Heritage programme.ldquoA medieval trail would leave a lasting legacy from the huge rise in visits to heritage sites used as Game Of Thrones locations, estimated by Tourism NI at , visitors in , and valued at pound million to the local economy, a spokesman for the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership said.ldquoThe Beyond Westeros Roadmap describes how political control was shared around  AD among  lordships of medieval Ulster and their stories played out around Dundrum Castle and other sites.ldquoThe project will also work with people, tour operators and tour guides, particularly in and around Downpatrick, to begin to establish medieval sites as cultural hubs within a network of linked sites.Iniduals, businesses, artisans and groups in Co Down will be invited to help develop medieval sites as cultural hubs for their community and for visitors.A portfolio of medieval stories and characters will be created to communicate to these cultural heritage tourists.This will enhance work already undertaken by Historic Environment Division to improve visitor access and community engagement with some sites in their care in the area, and they will be closely involved throughout the project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Armstrongs at Limerick  ","story":"SUNDAY saw Sean and Teresa Armstrong take part in the Great Limerick  Mile Run mdash made even more enjoyable by a beautul sunny day and a lively musical warm-up which saw runners entertaining the crowd by displaying some dodgy dance moves with the dance troupe on stage.Race four of the Hill and Dale series took Team Mac to Slieve Binian for the lsquorace to the toprsquo.This is only race of the series to finish on a mountain peak and Binian certainly doesnrsquot show any mercy to the competitors.A field of  lined up on the Head Road on a glorious evening, Binian was looking majestic in the evening sunshine, but no runner was admiring the view, competitors were all just looking in shock at the gradient that lay before them.Paul Byrne was race director and quickly gave the race briefing before giving the field a very abrupt start.A fast sprint up the lane towards the quarry with runners fighting for position before the steep incline up beside the wall.At the quarry the field slowed to a walk as legs began to burn climbing the , feet to the peak. The welcome sight of the stile at the wall brings relief to the faces of many as it means the finish is merely a  metres away.Some of the runners had to queue to get over, which was a welcome rest as they all prepared themselves for the last leg burn up the steepest finish of the series with the finish right at the peak.Hugh Oram was initially leading Team Mac up the wall when he was comfortably passed by Sean Armstrong, who greeted him as he passed and then disappeared into the distance.Sean finished in st in :, Hugh was six places behind him, then Colm Devlin, Laura Lynch, Dave Fulcher, Barry Poland with Regine Candau hot on his heels, finishing only six seconds behind.Liam Smyth was next, then Catherine Scannell, with Michael Power just behind. Another great turn out from MAC with quite a few hardy members having already competed in the Mourne Highline on the previous Saturday.EAMS NewtownabbeyIt was worth the early start on Saturday for Judith to travel to Monkstown Wood, Newtownabbey, for the .am half marathon as she came home with the award for first female.Belfast MarathonMurlough was well represented at Belfast City Marathon. First over the line for MAC was Kieran McShane followed by Eddie Murnin and Declan McCormick. Congratulations to Kevin Corrigan who knocked an amazing  minutes of his previous PB and Eddie Murnin with another PB. Marathon veterans Paula, Jackie and Ann were joined by Patricia Hogg who was competing in her first marathon and running in support of Air Ambulance. Tony, Gavin, Bernie and Myles completed the MAC team, with Sarah and Dave S both running the anchor leg of the Rely.

Her aspiration to draw all sections of the community together, with the common interest of participating in painting, stands in contrast to darker events of this year.The group began with four founding members and has continued to flourish, as can be seen in this yearrsquos annual display, which was opened in the St Patrick Centre last night by the distinguished artist, Neil Shawcross.The exhibition encompasses a range of themes and styles. Many of the works are inspired by local landscape.In Olive Davisonrsquos Tollymore Turbulence, a gushing stream rushes past the coppers and greens of an autumnal day, fallen leaves and racing water suggesting movement of time amidst stillness.Wendy Cromiersquos Killyleagh takes an unusual perspective, with fairy tale castle towers sloping through pastel streets to a yacht foregrounded below. The location is simultaneously recognisable mdash and magically dferent.A love of nature can be detected in the flowers and animals that feature. Maureen Lowersquos watercolour Mayrsquos Out is a close up of delicate spring blossom while snow dominates in Mairead Pattonrsquos North Tor, Slieve Bernagh, making the mountain ascent daunting. Marilyn Priorrsquos whiskered bunny is full of Easter cheer and there is humour in Brenda OrsquoConnorrsquos Mouse Watch in the black cat that patiently awaits its prey.Allusions to history are made in James Carneyrsquos two pieces done in pen and ink in one two women in an old fashioned bar clearly disapprove of lsquoThe state of himrsquo. Mairead Patton captures Hanlonrsquos for posterity in another work.

I had great help from the Laird family in the earlier days until my own family got up and were fit to help.Felixrsquos antidote to hard work was finding time to relax and enjoy himself.ldquoI loved watching horse racing, football and snooker on the TV and often attended Downpatrick races in the earlier days, he said.The secret to his long le  ldquoI was blessed with the company of a loving family, friends and neighbours and I love to see the younger generations coming to visit, he said.Felix says he always advised his family and friends to be content with what they had and not to take le too seriously.ldquoI dealt with things as they happened, thatrsquos how I dealt with le, he continued. ldquoI feel very lucky to have reached this age as a lot of my friends and family have passed before me. I always leave a weeof tea in the bottom of my cup so maybe this has helped me live so long!Felix was born in Ballykinlar just weeks before the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended the First World War, on June , .He was the fourth child of Felix and Ellen Burns and learnt the value of hard work from his parents. His father was a butcher, while his mother ran a small sweet shop and cafe and used to bake bread for the soldiers, particularly the GIs who were stationed at Ballykinlar army barracks during the Second World War.Felix was in his early twenties during the war. His youngest daughter, Anne, says the bombing of Belfast is something that stuck with him all his le.ldquoThe Blitz in Belfast is something that Daddy always talks about. He says he can remember that he and a friend climbed up to a top of a nearby hill to watch the bomber planes. The noise and drone of the bombers flying over was something that still stays in his mind.The family had moved to Rossglass when he was  and daughter Eileen recalls how his father courted her mother, Isobel , when she was just .ldquoDaddy tells us how he had to cycle into Downpatrick to go to the pictures with Mummy so it was a very dferent time to now, she said.The couple married in  and went on to have nine sons and four daughters mdash the late Oliver, Peter, Sean, Kate, Paddy, Eileen, Dominic, Eamonn, Kevin, Malachy, Martin, Mary and Anne.He worked the -acre farm at Ballylig Road until his later years but his children say that he still enjoys giving his son, Peter, who now runs the farm, his expert advice to keep him right.Felix grew potatoes for many years and most of the people from the village picked for him at some time or other, including Killoughrsquos own Canon Sean Rogan, former parish priest of Downpatrick, who visited him on his birthday.Eileen says that while their father was strict with them, he was always very kind and fun-loving.ldquoDaddy is cheerful, happy but believes in hard work. Hersquos very resilient and now he really enjoys seeing a good day on the farm and being brought out to the porch where he can hear the birds. He has always loved farming and is very passionate about nature, she said.Mrs Burns died of cancer in  and Felix has had more than several close calls with his health since then.Eileen said: ldquoHersquos had four heart attacks, hip replacements and skin cancer, but he has been blessed with good health and we put that down to his hard work and plain eating. He wouldnrsquot have any kind of takeaway about him.For the last  years, he has received daily care from two healthcare assistants, Cindy and Amera, who the family say are devoted to their father and they are forever grateful for what they do for him.While two of his children live away from home mdash Eileen in London and Eamon in Kilkenny, Felix kept his travels to Britain and Ireland.ldquoDaddy came over to see me in London when he was  and was on the Tube for the first time in his le. He couldnrsquot believe how erse London was and the buzz about it. He loved it, added Eileen.Felix is known for his friendliness and was never one to pass a neighbour on a lane or the road without stopping for a chat.He and his two childhood friends of more than  years, Henry Starkey and Tam Montgomery, were stalwarts at the Minerstown Tavern every Saturday night mdash so much so that there is a framed painting of the three of them hanging today in the bar.Felix and his family had asked friends to give donations in lieu of gts to Cancer Fund for Childrenrsquos Daisy Lodge Centre in Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Claragh Bridge rally raises £3%2C000 for charity  ","story":"CLARAGH Bridge Vintage Club held their annual rally in aid of Motor Neurone Disease Associationunder blue skies and fine sunshine on Friday evening.Over  tractors and  vintage classic cars and Land Rovers revved up their engines and took to the grassy catwalk, in the field behind Oasis Community Centre.The event was organised by club chairman Liam Quinn, from Drumaroad, in memory of local farmer Hugh McClean, from Ballykinlar, who died from the illness in September last year, just six years after his diagnosis.

But it is the Downpatrick area which has been most affected by the lost days.After Down councillors were given a private memorandum of the record of absenteeism and sick leave among the bin men, Downpatrick councillor George Flinn immediately launched into an attack on their conduct.He said he was appalled by the absentee figures and wanted to know whether discipline was tight enough and whether men were dismissed after after they had been warned.ldquoSomething is wrong and it will have to be put right, he said. ldquoI do not see why these men are being retainedthey are not present.

Horace soon began researching the effects of the Troubles on the RVH, and started collecting photos, videos and press clippings. The shoebox collection grew and eventually occupied two filing cabinets.He had intended to write a book on the subject, but sudden illness put an end to that intention. He subsequently made his Troubles archive available to other authors, such as the late Kate OrsquoHanlon, senior sister in RVH Casualty, Margaret Wilson and Moore Sinnerton.In June  he sustained a sudden onset of severe ME, which immediately ended his hospital career. He spent most of the next five years flat on his back in bed, with frequent migraines, insomnia, continual acute flu-like symptoms, muscle pain and weakness, weird new allergies, and a brain gone AWOL.On air on Sunday he compared ME to having a defective battery on a mobile phone. Instead of the battery operating for  hours a day, it reluctantly provides power for only two hours. And once flat, it takes a full day to recharge. Horace never thought it was a fatal condition. But it has the same ill effects as a killer disease mdash energy loss on such a scale suddenly deprives you of job, career, income, and social and family le.ME was first defined in  by a famous Ulster doctor, Sir Donald Acheson. In the  years since, the NHS has made very little progress in identying a cause, or developing a cure. So ME patients find it very dficult to access competent medical care. But they have no dficulty in encountering hostility, prejudice, and stigma.Horace received exemplary care from a small number of NHS doctors. But he experienced hostility, suspicion and a damaging lack of knowledge with some others. His eventual route to partial rehabilitation was provided, not by the NHS, but by the arts and media sectors in Belfast and Down District.Part of his initial five-year nightmare was that he couldnrsquot read much, or watch TV. By the time he got to the bottom of a page, he had forgotten what he had read at the top. Eventually he discovered thathe underlined relevant sentences in a book, he could then fix information in his memory.Triggered by the cover illustration on Jonathon Bardonrsquos first edition A History of Ulster, in  he had begun researching the  Rebellion and the associated fighting in his home town of Ballynahinch. He continued this exploration after illness hit in . By  mdash the Rebellion bicentenary mdash he had acquired a wide knowledge of th century politics, personalities, warfare and weapons.A number of NHS personnel seemed to doubt Horacersquos sanity and or integrity mdash an attitude they automatically extended to all ME patients. But other prominent iniduals, in equally august institutions, took an entirely dferent view. Horace had amassed a knowledge of the  period, and in  they all wanted to access it mdash Brian Turner from the Down Museum, Dr Desmond Bailie of the Presbyterian Historical Society, Moore Sinnerton at the BBC and Jane Leonard at the Ulster Museum.Post-ME Horace had signicant dficulty with reading and writing at any . So everyone was very patient with the small amounts and slow pace of his product. But eventually he produced a well-reviewed major article on the Battle of Ballynahinch, . And he gave a lively bicentennial lecture on Betsy Gray to a capacity audience at the Ulster Museum. A new career was launched, though on a much, much smaller scale than before the onset of illness.Horace has now developed a lecturing technique which overcomes his dficulty with the written word. His PowerPoints are really image-rich slide-shows, and he talks to what he sees in the pictures. Audiences remark that ldquohe can talk for an hour without notes, unaware that he continually faces the screen, and uses the images as visual prompts. They quite like the near-cinema experience.Recently Pamela Cooper, of the Lecale Historical Society, has further improved on his technique. She made a tran of his Five Montalto Dynasties lecture, and then turned it into a major printed article mdash his first in  years.Horace continues to have signicant ME disability, with the typical energy deficit, so for him local history is a vital form of occupational therapy. One of his reasons for going on radio was to thank all those down the decades who have given him an outlet for his hobby.These include the late Dr. Brum Henderson, of the Ballynahinch Murals Group Vincent Fullam, of Ballynahinch Regeneration Joanne Patterson, BBC, Your Place and Mine Martyn Todd, of Discover Saintfield: Dr Winston Shaw and the Presbyterian Historical Society Gordon Wilson and the late David Anderson at Montalto Estates Dr Eacuteamon Phoenix the Editors of the Mourne Observer and Down Recorder, on many occasions Dr. Terry Cross at Killaney Lodge Karen Patterson, of the Rowallane Slieve Croob Partnership and many Probus branches and local historical societies.Arthur Davidson, Derek Rowlinson, and Peter Rowan have always kept him supplied with rare books., as did Deirdre Armstrong when the SEELB Library Board Irish Special Collection was based in Ballynahinch. Recently, published authors have consulted him about the  period, such as Conor OrsquoClery, Ken Dawson and Guy Beiner.For Horace, outdoor recreation is almost a thing of the past. But MLA Jim Wells allows him on board his birdwatching boat trips on the north coast. By this means it is possible to enjoy unique access to glorious scenery at Carrick-a-Rede, Torr Head, Fair Head and Rathlin, all without getting out of your seat, or walking a yard.Guests on Sundayrsquos BBC programme were allowed to play one piece of music: Horace picked a paraphrase from the Scottish Psalter. During the worst period of his illness he was often unable to read, but he could always enjoy music. He steadily worked his way through the HMV Classical CD catalogue. And he also reverted to the music of his childhood ndash hymns he remembered from the Ballynahinch Methodists.Dr. William Drennan, founder of the United Irishmen, once worshipped at First Presbyterian Church in Ballynahinch in . That was before the introduction of hymn-singing and church organs. Horacersquos own Scottish ancestors probably arrived around , and he imagined they would have used paraphrases in their services.This article is an amalgam of what Horace actually said on radio ndash and what he would have said given another half hour on microphone!

He was threatening to spoil the party after polling a particularly impressive  first preference votes.While not considered a threat by pundits, McMurray came just  votes short mdash after transfers mdash of causing a major shock.In the end, what was proving an uncomfortable evening and early morning for Sinn Fein sitting councillor Willie Clarke, who described the election campaign as the most intensive he had ever been involved in, and newcomer Leeanne McEvoy, ended in relieved smiles.As the duo waited for their election to be confirmed, Doran, who had been awake from .am, was nervously placing the floor, admitting to reporters he felt a ldquonervous wreck as what at times seemed a laborious election count continued.The smile on his face was unmissable when it was formally confirmed that his partners had been elected but, sadly, for the Sinn Fein duo, there was only a handful of party supporters in the election count centre to congratulate them as everyone  had gone home.Nonetheless, Doran, McEvoy and Clarke celebrated together, clearly recognising the signicance of the result for Republicans in an area once regarded as a unionist stronghold.The SDLPrsquos Laura Devlin, who was popping in and out of the count to keep an eye on her new baby Polly who is two months old, comfortably retained her seat with , votes but the election marked the end for her party colleague, Brian Quinn, who was eliminated after polling just  first preference votes.Given that he was so far behind, it was inevitable that Quinn, who was a member of the former Newry and Mourne Council, would lose his seat, although early on in the count it was not clear to whom. When the SDLP stalwart was formally eliminated from the contest he was consoled by his loyal party colleagues.As for DUP man Hanna, his canvass was hampered by the fact that  weeks ago he underwent hip replacement surgery, restricting his mobility. However, the voters came out in numbers helping him top the poll which he admitted he hadnrsquot expected.Elsewhere, there were resounding wins for the UUPrsquos Harold McKee mdash who is ing to the council chamber for a second time after losing his South Down Assembly seat in  when the number was reduced from six to five mdash and Independent Unionist Henry Reilly.The highly respected McKee is no stranger to elections and admitted that the most recent was his easiest to date. Given the absence of the Assembly he believes it is time more powers were handed to local councils to let them get on with the job of looking after their respective districts.McKee insists that local government is about delivering for people, highlighting the importance of all councillors working together for the benefit of their respective areas.Reilly, who fought his first election  years ago and along with McKee was elected on the second count, surprisingly admitted that he was worried going into this one as he did not have a party machine behind him. He described his election as ldquomost satisfying.While his vote dipped by over  from , Reilly explained that when he topped the poll five years ago as a member of UKIP, the party was spending tens of thousands of pounds on its EU election campaign and he was its Northern Ireland candidate.Afraid that his council vote could have collapsed by as much as , Reilly focused his election campaign solely on Kilkeel and Annalong which he described as his ldquoheartland also expressing concern that he was not allow to declare himself as an Independent Unionist on the ballot paper and that Alliance was running a strong candidate.As for McMurray, he insisted that he had no regrets switching to The Mournes as it ldquofelt the right thing to do and was pleased with his performance first time out in an area which was new to him.He used a football analogy to describe coming just  votes short of causing a major upset, adding: ldquoItrsquos like playing well away from home and losing -. A great game and great performance but you donrsquot get the three points. It is certainly not the end and given that there are almost , Alliance voters in The Mournes it is a bigger mandate than some people elected in other areas have.

It is a problem they need to solve with SDLP and Sinn Fein sources suggesting better engagement with these particular voters is needed.The SDLPrsquos share of the vote in the Downpatrick DEA has decreased from almost % five years ago to .% with Sinn Feinrsquos share decreasing slightly from .% in  to .%.By contrast, Independent candidate Cadogan Enright increased his vote by , comfortably passing the , mark for the first time.Pundits were suggesting that Enright could end up locked in a battle for the fth seat with the SDLPrsquos Trainor and there were audible gasps in the Newry count centre when it was officially confirmed that the Independent candidate had finished second behind Sharvin on first preference votes, immediately placing increasing pressure on those chasing the remaining three seats.Enrightrsquos increased vote, which did not come as a surprise to the man himself, is viewed as a reward for his hard work with community groups in Downpatrick and those dotted across Lecale where he is extremely active in village communities.And, just like in , many of these groups officially endorsed his candidacy and played a key role in an election canvass which saw a small army of workers trudge across the district on his behalf knocking doors and putting election material through letterboxes.Regarded as a politician who gets things done, Enright is a thorn in the side of the big two parties in Downpatrick who took time to digest his performance at last weekrsquos poll.Enright insists that analysis of the past four council elections in the Downpatrick DEA confirms that both the SDLP and Sinn Fein are losing favour with the people of Down and Lecale and that over the same period the unionist vote has remained steady at around seven percent.Aontuacutersquos Macartan Digney surprised many when he polled  votes and there are those who suggest that the well known candidate who is a member of the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella body for local community groups and residentsrsquo associations ndash may have taken votes off Enright whose first preference performance may have been even better.As for the SDLP, the party heaved a huge sigh of relief that its three runners, including the provincersquos longest serving councillor, Dermot Curran, made it home.All the party candidates had a fight on their hands with veteran Curran openly admitting that he was worried going into the election, describing it as his toughest to date. Sinn Fein clearly had the SDLP worried.Republicans fought an intense campaign as it always do and there was obvious disappointment that only Hanlon, contesting her first election, secured a seat, with Madden unable to join her.Hanlon, who works for South Down MLA Emma Rogan, ticks an important box for Sinn Fein as she lives and works in Downpatrick and is acutely aware of the key issues which she will be able to address at council level.Not having a councillor on the ground in the county town was an issue the party wanted to address at this election, but the hope of having two candidates evaporated as the Downpatrick count progressed and Madden struggled to secure the transfers he needed to join his party colleagues in the chamber.Alliance, which did not field a candidate in , was delighted with the performance of student Tiernan Laird who polled  votes,  ahead of the UUPrsquos Alexander Burgess, who was the partyrsquos third choice to contest one of the five seats up for grabs in Downpatrick.The DUPrsquos James Savage increased the party vote by five, polling  first preferences, while the Green Partyrsquos Jamie Kennedy polled  votes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein now biggest party  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos chairman and vice-chairman were the high profile casualties of last weekrsquos local election.Following a marathon two-day count at Newry Leisure Centre, current SDLP chairman Mark Murnin lost out to his running mate Hugh Gallagher in Slieve Croob while his Sinn Fein deputy, Oksana McMahon, lost her seat in Crotlieve in an election of shocks and surprises.Overall, Sinn Fein emerged as the biggest party with  seats mdash up two from  mdash but it was a bad election for the SDLP which lost three of its most experienced councillors, Kate Loughran , Brian Quinnand Michael Carr . The party now has  seats.Alliancersquos Patrick Brown produced a stunning performance to top the poll in Rowallane, with another shock in Slieve Croob where Ulster Unionist Alan Lewis, who was contesting his first election, topped the poll.Sinn Feinrsquos bold strategy of running three candidates in The Mournes paid off, but the election also marked the rise of the Independents with stunning performances by Cadogan Enright , Jarlath Tinnelly, Mark Gibbonsand Gavin Malone in Newry.Sinn Fein went into the election with hopes of potentially taking up to  seats given the runaway success of South Down MP Chris Hazzard in the  Westminster poll when Republicans won a % share of the vote across the constituency.The party earmarked Downpatrick as a key battleground to secure two seats and had high hopes for Oonagh Hanlon and Jordan Madden, who were contesting their first elections. But it wasnrsquot to be with only Hanlon getting over the line as Madden struggled to secure the transfers he needed to join her.A statement of intent by Republicans to secure three seats in The Mournes for the first time paid off with Sean Doran, Willie Clarke and Leeanne McEvoy elected, with the election of latter two confirmed shortly before am on Saturday.Sinn Fein were also bidding to secure three seats in Slieve Croob, but sitting councillor John Rice lost his seat, with Roisin Howell and Cathy Mason elected. Republicans were also disappointed at the loss of Ukrainian-born McMahon in Crotlieve amid suggestions by their political rivals that they had overstretched in this area.Despite McMahonrsquos loss, Gerry OrsquoHare and Mickey Ruane were elected in this DEA, while in Slieve Gullion it was almost a clean sweep with the party taking five of the seven available seats.The SDLP were mightily relieved to retain their three seats in Downpatrick with Gareth Sharvin topping the poll and joined by his colleagues Dermot Curran and John Trainor, the latter getting over the line thanks to UUP transfersBut the loss of council chairman Murnin to his party colleague, Hugh Gallagher, in Slieve Croob was a major blow for the party.The effervescent Terry Andrews secured his seat in Rowallane, but he missed out on topping the poll this time around and Laura Devlin was unable to take her running mate Brian Quinn over the line with her in The Mournes, much to the disappointment of the party. Quinnrsquos seat was one of a number Sinn Fein had targeted and successfully wrestled from the grasp of nationalists.Declan McAteer retained his seat in Crotlieve with former South Down MLA Karen McKevitt securing a seat. Pete Byrne recorded the third highest vote in Slieve Gullion but Loughran missed out despite polling , first preference votes.Alliance retained the two seats it held in Rowallane and Slieve Croob and came agonisingly close to pulling off a major shock in The Mournes where Andy McMurray, who had switched from Slieve Croob, came  votes short of denying Sinn Fein its hat-trick success.McMurray wasnrsquot given much of a chance as the party only polled  votes in , but he pulled in almost  first preferences as the Alliance surge across the Province had ripple effect across the district.Pundits had not predicted Brown topping the poll with some even suggesting that he could have been involved in a dogfight for the fth seat after the decision by Independent Martyn Todd to enter the fray. How wrong they were with him securing , first preference votes.Gregory Bain, who was defending the party seat in Slieve Croob, was ahead of Murnin by  first preference votes and this effectively kept the council chairman behind the eight ball for the remainder of the count. Newry candidate Helena Young also polled well in her first outing securing  first preferences. The UUP were cock-a-hoop that Lewis, contesting his first election, topped the poll with a stunning performance, more than doubling Dessie Pattersonrsquos vote in  to take his seat in the chamber alongside David Taylor , the ing Harold McKee in The Mournes and Rowallane stalwart Robert Burgess.But there was disappointment that Walter Lyons did not join Lyons in Rowallane, with party officials also pointing to the lsquoTodd factorrsquo which resulted in Burgess being unable to transfer as many votes as planned to his running mate.The DUPto the council with one seat less after Maynard Hanna failed to retain the Slieve Croob seat previously held by Garth Craig. Despite the disappointment, Glyn Hanna topped the poll in The Mournes for the first time mdash just weeks after hip replacement surgery, with Billy Walker and Harry Harvey retaining their seats in Rowallane where it is a case of as you were with the same five councillors ing to the council.Independent Unionist Henry Reilly, who topped the poll in The Mournes in , was delighted to retain his seat three decades after he fought his first election, describing his success as his ldquomost satisfying as he did not have a major party behind him, as was the case five years ago when he was a UKIP candidate.Aontuacute will be relatively pleased with its first election performance with its three candidates polling over , votes.

He could not have hidden his delighthe had wanted to.His win secured the seat for the UUP in an area where the DUP was previously the dominant unionist representative.Lewis said that he treated his canvass as a job interview and his message clearly resonated with voters. He believes there is a clear disconnect between residents and local government and aims to help repair the damage in his new role as a councillor.The UUP man, who was previously a member of UKIP and the TUV, says he intends to rebuild ldquotrust and confidence and maintains that politics is about ldquomaking an impact, not an income.Ballynahinch man Garth Craig polled , votes for the DUP in , but his decision to bow out of local politics prompted the party to select the experienced Maynard Hanna from the Mourne area to contest the seat.Hanna polled  votes but could not secure the transfers he needed with party sources suggesting that evenhad lived closer to Slieve Croob, it may not have been enough given the fact that UUP man Lewis has enjoyed a high profile over recent years.Sinn Fein invested much in their three Slieve Croob candidates and were hoping to get all three elected, but the vagaries of a PR election can often throw up unexpected results.The fact three Sinn Fein candidates captured over % of the votes was a signicant achievement, but sadly not enough to help sitting councillor Rice retain his seat.Roisin Howell, who was co-opted to replace Stephen Burns, produced a storming performance securing , votes but her colleague Cathy Mason, also contesting her first local government election, went even better, securing , votes.Both were understandably nervous as the count entered its final stages, with the exclusion of Rice paving the way for the two women to secure their seats, much to the delight of the Sinn Fein contingent following what a y campaign.Party officials have high hopes for the two women who intend to focus on a number of key issues including tourism and community, in particular, much-needed facilities for families across Slieve Croob.Their election further increases the number of women in the chamber with Sinn Fein delighted at the impact this will have moving forward.As for Alliance, Bain said he will be focusing on mental health issues.

Niall Johnson used his speed to torture the St Michaelrsquos defence as he left his marker in his wake and bore down on goal in the first minute only to see his shot saved by Gavin Marsden.St Michaelrsquos were lively in the opening minutes and they opened the scoring in the fth minute with a m free from the dangerous Joe McIlduff, who was deadly from the frees throughout the game and St Paulrsquos had to limit the fouls they conceded due to his accuracy.St Paulrsquos opened their account with a left-footed free from man of the match Fintan Eastwood from m and St Michaelrsquos hit back with a handy free from Conor OrsquoNeill.Seaacuten Tucker then tagged on a trio of points to help the Holywood men pull away from their west Down opponents.St Michaelrsquos, though, struck back with their first score from Brian Morgan. Fintan Eastwood added his second score of the game after great work from Daacuteire Rooney in midfield.St Michaelrsquos came back at Holywood and some great work left Morgan free to slot the ball over the bar, but a terric block by St Paulrsquos defender Jonny Parsons prevented the score.St Paulrsquos gathered possession and transitioned the ball up to Niall Johnson, who again left his marker for dead and bore down on the St Michaelrsquos goal before passing to Seaacuten Tucker.However, he was fouled to stop him scoring a goal, but Eastwood tapped over the resulting free from m. Eastwood added his fourth point of a fantastic game for him after great work by Conleth Rooney to set him up.Tucker added a m free before the first goal of the game. Daacuteire Rooney won the resulting kick out and ran m at speed into heart of the St Michaelrsquos defence before passing the ball to Tucker.He danced past two defenders before slotting the ball past Gavin Marsden in the St Michaelrsquos net. Further points from Eastwood, Niall Johnson and a Tucker free left the score at half-time a lopsided - to -.St Michaelrsquos again came out strongly in the second half and dominated play for the first five minutes with John Kearney scoring from play and McIlduff adding another free.St Paulrsquos finally came out for the second half when Daacuteire Rooney ran at the St Michaelrsquos defence before slotting over a terric point from m. Not to be outdone, the industrious Ben Gray took himself on a similar run and had the same result as he slotted over a point.St Paulrsquos were forced into an early substitution in the second half with Daniel Eastwood, ing from Australia, replacing Rooney, who pulled up with a hamstring injury.Danielrsquos brother, Fintan, added to his score collection with another point before Rooney scored the best point of the game. The Lisburn Distillery soccer star won the ball in midfield before taking off on a m lung-bursting sprint with the ball before a neat one-two with Daniel Eastwood provided him the space to slot the ball over from m, much to the delight of the St Paulrsquos supporters.Daniel Eastwood then took centre stage proving what a great asset he is going to be for St Paulrsquos going forward as he scored the next three points all from play.Last seasonrsquos player of the year Daacuteire McGrattan came off the bench for Daacuteire Rooney showing the depth St Paulrsquos now have in the  and he quickly made his mark.After a St Michaelrsquos player was rightly yellow carded for a rash sliding tackle, St Paulrsquos took the free kick quickly and a marauding McGrattan took the ball at high speed and fought off the challenges before smashing it into the top corner of the St Michaelrsquos net. McIlduff continued to punish St Paulrsquos indiscretions by scoring five frees in the second half, but St Paulrsquos were too strong and Fintan Eastwood added to his man of the match performance with his seventh point of the game.Seaacuten Tucker rounded off the scoring with the last score of the game. A convincing win for the Holywood men, but in truth there were multiple chances for goals that were not taken and in the stronger tests to come, the St Paulrsquos lads are going to have to be much more clinical in taking those goal chances.St Paulrsquos: Craig McKenna, Owen Loughran, Conor McPeake, Johnny Parsons, Ruairi Collins, Paddy Falls, Ben Gray , Daacuteire Rooney , Gerard Walls, Fintan Eastwood , Seaacuten Tucker , Martin Cox, Oliver Monaghan, Conleth Rooney, Niall Johnston .

Young people from across Northern Ireland will also join the audience at the UU’s Belfast campus.The report launch comes amid renewed efforts at Stormont to restore the power-sharing institutions after more than two years without a ing government.Professor Morrow said the recent murder of journalist Lyra McKee in Londonderry should focus minds on the need to act.“The deeply tragic events of recent weeks sharpen the focus on just how dangerously close we remain to this residual threat,” he said.Arlene Foster rounds on Theresa May over lack of vision for post-Brexit UK Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The young people taking part reflect the hope and optimism that we all hold for Northern Ireland, but we have a duty of care and leadership to ensure that the expectation, aspiration and potential of the next and future generations is met and not stled by sectarian polarisation. We hope that the review’s recommendations will make possible the step change needed.”The Sir George Quigley Fund was set up by the Ulster Bank in honour of its former chairman. The leading civil servant and businessman was a strong advocate of initiatives to tackle sectarianism.Ronnie Kells, chair of the Quigley Fund committee, said: “We acknowledge the extremely positive contribution made over the years by many iniduals and organisations to address sectarianism, often working silently and unrecognised.“Regrettably, sectarianism still lingers at the heart of our society and acts as a barrier to prosperity and as an insult to a civilised community. This scourge of several generations will persist unless resolute and sustained action is taken to address it.“Everyone has a role to play in addressing this problem – it is not the sole responsibility of government or the political parties in Northern Ireland. “Civic society needs to work with them to ensure it is placed at the top of the public agenda alongside the economy as a key priority. We trust that our conference will help to establish the foundations for a credible solution driven by collegiate and concerted civic leadership and action.”try catch  TrendingFirefighter who died in NI motorbike crash named locallySunday Times Rich List : These are the  richest people in Northern IrelandMichael Dunlop wrist injury could jeopardise prospects at North West  and Isle of Man TTOne person rushed to hospital after pedestrian and lorry incident -

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

Either, they will need it when we leave, or they will need itwe stay,” Mr Thompson said.The status applies primarily to physical goods being transported across customs areas, including manufacturers, agri-business and general retail.Martin Dubbey, managing director of Safeguard AEO, said: “The big concern is not just the Northern Ireland border with the Republic. You also have  HGVs coming out every day down to the port, and then across.“I think there has to be some sort of fudge .”Meanwhile, Karen Wheeler, who heads the UK Border Delivery Group, has told a group of businesses here that there is no magic technological solution for preventing a hard border in Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gym_1.jpg","title":"new exercise business for city centre hotel","story":"Posted on Tuesday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest hotel will soon be punching well above its weight as a new exercise business sets up shop, Ulster Business can reveal.Fitness franchise Round has been growing in the UK at a steady pace, and will open its doors later this month at the Grand Central Hotel in Belfast city centre.Rather than running on a set schedule, a new Round session starts every three minutes, allowing a new workout every day, including a range of weight resistance, cardio and core-strength training.The company is one of the first brands in the UK to utilise wearable heart-rate technology, and class participants wear heart rate monitors, which are hooked up to a big screen in the gym.It’s understood Round Belfast will be opening in May .

Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
