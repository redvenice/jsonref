Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill There has been a surge in applications from schools to upgrade their buildings with better ventilation and outdoor play areas, new figures show.Minister for Education Norma Foley has announced that 500 projects have been approved for upgrades worth €65 million under this year’s summer works scheme. This compares with a total of 275 approved projects last year at a cost of €31 million.Separately, the Department of Education has confirmed that Covid risk mitigation measures – such as wearing masks – are to remain in schools until at least the end of the midterm break on February 28th. They are due to be reviewed in advance of this date and any changes will be communicated before schools reopen.The summer works scheme, meanwhile, is designed to allow schools to carry out small and medium-scale building works that will improve and upgrade existing school buildings.Many of the projects this year include window replacements, improvement to yards and play areas, as well as new science labs, roofs, mechanical and electrical works.In a statement, Ms Foley said the funding was being announced now to allow schools a good lead-in period to plan and deliver the projects this summer.“School communities have done an exceptional job in adapting to the changes required to operate safely in a Covid-19 environment,” she said.“A key priority is to continue to support and sustain the operation of schools in this context. I am particularly pleased that the cohort of projects announced today include window improvementreplacement projects in schools which will assist in managing ventilation in these schools.”Outside play areasShe said improvements to external yards and play areas were key as the provision of “fun and engaging outside play areas” was equally important in helping students and young learners engage with each other in a Covid-19 environment.The funding is separate to last month’s decision to provide €62 million in minor works grants as part of additional pandemic-related supports.Under this programme, schools have flexibility on how they use funding to improve their premises including the purchase of high-efficiency particulate-absorbing filter (Hepa) machines if they are deemed necessary. A breakdown of the projects announced on Monday show the majority (309) are at primary level and involve mechanical works (89 schools), electrical works (65 schools), window projects (89 schools) and external yardsplay areas (64 schools).At second level (109 projects), upgrades include roof works (81 schools), mechanical works (34 schools), electrical works (12 schools), window projects (35 schools), science labs (23 schools) and yardsplay areas (five schools).Ms Foley said it was envisaged that the remaining categories of projects from the current multi-annual summer works scheme would be dealt with as part of next year’s summer works programme in 2023. Relevant schools will be notified towards the end of this year.The Minister added that a new multi-annual summer works scheme with a strong climate action aspect would be open for new applications in the first half of this year.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"dublin city council to curb build to rent and small apartment developments","story":" Lord Mayor of Dublin Alison Gilliland: The policy change aims to encourage “high-standard, long-term, secure and sustainable housing”. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillCurbs on build-to-rent developments and studio and one-bedroom apartments are set to be introduced by Dublin City Council.The new Dublin City Development Plan aims to stop developers from building blocks with no homes for sale, and to restrict studio and one-bed apartments to a maximum of 30 per cent of the development.Build-to-rent schemes will also be restricted to specific parts of Dublin, including the inner city areas of “high-intensity employment” ie with more than 500 employees per hectare within 500m of major public transport interchanges and within identified Strategic Development Regeneration Zones.‘Critical mass’No housing schemes would be rental-only under the new plan. Build-to-rent schemes of more than 100 homes would have to have at least 40 per cent of properties available for sale. Build-to-rent schemes of fewer than 100 homes will generally not be permitted, as they would not have a “critical mass” to support good communal facilities.City planner John O’Hara said the policy changes are not a build-to-rent ban.“The draft development plan is predicated on the whole notion of neighbourhood-making and sustainable communities. What we are looking for is a tenure ersity across the spectrum. Build-to-rent has only emerged in the last three years, but it has largely displaced build-to sell altogether,” he said.Remote working“The message from the property industry is that this is going to sink the whole build-to-rent typology. That is not the intention – with 40 per cent build-to-buy, the majority is still build-to-rent.”The reduction in the number of studio and one-beds in all apartment schemes, from a 50 per cent to a 30 per cent maximum, in part reflected the trend towards more remote working where people were more likely to require an extra room in their apartment, Mr O’Hara said.Lord Mayor Alison Gilliland said the policy change aimed to foster “high-standard, long-term, secure and sustainable housing”.Submissions on the draft plan can be made until February 14th."},{"url":null,"title":"fantastic buzz in dublin city as restrictions end","story":"Enda Keogh, owner of Peter’s pub in 1 Johnston Place, Dublin 2, said Saturday night was “very busy”.There has been “a fantastic buzz” in Dublin city over the weekend after the Taoiseach’s address to the nation, announcing that almost all Covid-19 restrictions would end. Paul Cadden, owner of the Saba restaurant group, said there was “great excitement among staff and customers on Friday when the news broke.”“People were wondering, is this really true? Everybody is just delighted to be back out, a lot of people were feeling like they weren’t allowed to be before,” he said.Saba restaurants were trading throughout the restrictions and the 8pm closing time, but it had been quiet. “Online bookings and the phone are a lot busier now with people booking for groups and parties. It gives us all great hope in the industry,” Mr Cadden said.Enda Keogh, owner of Peter’s pub, said Saturday night was “very busy”.“We’ve been lucky in that we were busy when we were open with the early closing time thanks to regulars but the huge thing for us now is not having to do the contact tracing and all the admin,” he said.“I’ve been here since I was a child, it’s a family business, and it was just soul destroying sending customers home at eight in the evening, so it’s great to go back to normal trading hours now.”In Smithfield at 3pm in the afternoon, three cafes had a wait time of more than twenty minutes to get a seat. One staff member said it had been “the busiest Sunday in a while,” and a woman having coffee with two friends said they had been “out the night before at a nightclub in town” and the group were “having a celebratory hangover lunch”.The Lighthouse cinema in Smithfield and the Irish Film Institute in Temple Bar were both “really busy” on Sunday with the extended opening hours.Ian Redmond of Tramline nightclub did not open like some other clubs on Saturday night, as breweries weren’t able to deliver on time with the short notice.“The orders went in on Friday and we’re getting deliveries tomorrow. We sold out 900 tickets in three hours for Monday night. It feels like Garth Brooks is coming to town or something,” he said.Clubs are unable to get their special exemptions for late night trading until the District Court resumes next week, but Mr Redmond had the idea to do a belated New Year’s Eve countdown celebration for those customers who may never have experienced that before.“Why wait another eleven and a half months to celebrate the New Year? We’ve ordered balloons and champagne and everything. It’s great, it’s really exciting,” he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"full public inquiry of covid 19 pandemic required says mary lou mcdonald","story":"Mary Lou McDonald said that a public inquiry should be time bound and should look in particular at the experience of nursing homes in the first wave.  Photograph: Alan Betson  The Mary Lou McDonald has said a full public inquiry should be undertaken into the Covid-19 pandemic rather than having a review focused solely on the healthcare response. The Sinn Féin leader was speaking after the Sunday Times reported that Government leaders have decided not to have a commission of inquiry or Oireachtas committee examine how the State has handled the pandemic. It is instead planning to begin discussions shortly on the appointment of an expert group to review the matter.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said he would seek Government approval for a report into the handling of the pandemic by the health service. It is not what clear the scope of that report would be, and whether it would be public or published, although Mr Donnelly said it would also examine the future of public health in the country.“Neither of those will suffice,” Ms McDonald told RTÉ’s This Week programme. “We have argued for a public inquiry,” she said, adding that it should be time bound and should look in particular at the experience of nursing homes in the first wave. A Coalition spokesman said the programme for government had committed to “review and learn lessons” from the handling of the pandemic. “An evaluation of how the country managed this pandemic will focus on what can be learned in the event of future pandemics or public health emergencies, and for reform of the health service,” he said. “The form and appropriate time of any review is still to be decided by government, as we continue to deal with the threat of Covid-19.” A source indicated that the coalition’s desire is to keep focused on Covid-19 and that the form of any inquiry was still to be discussed by Government. They added it would likely include expertise from operational and clinical sides. Another source said there has not been much discussion about the format of an inquiry yet, but that they would favour a “public element”. Ms McDonald also called for a hybrid option for the Leaving Cert this year, saying students taking the exam had suffered disruption right across the cycle of their studies. “They will still have their masks on, will still be in cold classrooms with the windows open, so we’re not back (to normal) by any stretch.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"maureen dowd goodbye andr%C3%A9 leon talley my glorious difficult friend","story":"André Leon Talley in Durham, North Carolina, where he grew up, in December 2016. Photograph: Jeremy M LangeThe New York TimesAndré Leon Talley was not the easiest of friends. He could be demanding. And cutting. And moody.But he was the most glorious of friends. He was soigné, to use one of his favourite words, and he had éclat, to use another. He was a true icon, prowling the world in search of glamour and beauty, disdaining “dreckitude”.“ ‘Dreckitude’ is the lowest point in the lowest ebb,” he once explained, adding, “ ‘Dreck’ is a total, total, total hot mess.”He was a hoarder who had all the most beautiful crystal and linens – not to mention Truman Capote’s old sofa – but he never entertained. He sometimes wondered why he could ensorcell so many with his wit and style but not have a lover.“I had dinners alone and I didn’t do lines of coke,” he told me about the Studio 54 era, when he worked for Andy Warhol. “I was not sexually promiscuous at all. I was fierce and smart and I did not exude that sexual energy. I wanted people to like me because I was smart, not for my black sex vibe!”André could be so hilarious that Tom Ford collected his friend’s emails and notes in a little book because they were “truly works of art”. “When he was excited, he was excited,” said Ford, who told me that he sometimes got a four-page letter on hotel stationery slipped under his door after a fashion show. “When he loved something, he loved it. When he hated something, he hated it. He was never boring.”I got to know André after he sent me a letter, in his big, loopy handwriting, about a column I wrote when my mom, who came from a family of Irish maids, died in 2005. He told me about his late grandmother in Durham, North Carolina, Bennie Davis, a maid for the men’s dormitory at Duke University, who raised him from the time he was a baby.His grandmother sparked some Proustian connections that would cause him problems later in life. He did not want to be the size of a “manatee”, he told me, but “the smell of a biscuit in butter and molasses” was his “opioid”, evoking his grandmother’s love.“So sad I got fat and had to resort to Scarlett curtains and portieres, disguised as caftans and djellabas!” he said. “But I soldier on. Hard work, though.”Ironed boxersHis grandmother taught him that poverty is not an impediment to panache she boiled his sheets white and ironed his boxer shorts and towels. Later, after Diana Vreeland plucked the tall, skinny black kid with the master’s in French literature from Brown University to be her unpaid assistant at the politan Museum Costume Institute, André understood completely when Vreeland ironed her dollar bills and tissues. Crispness was all.Indeed, it was one of the wrinkles in our relationship. I’m not an ironer. In fact, back in the 1970s, I threw out the family ironing board my mom had given me, in some sort of misguided feminist protest.When André would see me getting ready to go out in a wrinkled cocktail dress, he would fold his arms over his chest and order me to go change, or risk looking like “a roadshow Rita Hayworth”. Although that sounded good to me.Once, when we were going to the politan Opera, André looked at the bit of my sea foam vintage gown that was peeking out from under my coat. “Tulle,” he murmured ominously. “Blanche DuBois.”Another time, he took me to a White House brunch celebrating Barack Obama’s second inauguration. “This is your date?” Obama asked André, raising an eyebrow. But André didn’t care. He was focused on my footwear.“Rag \u0026amp Bone bootees are not for going to the White House,” he instructed me when we were out of the receiving line. “They are for going to Starbucks. ”As André said about his advice, “I AM NEVER WRONG!” He advised all women to moisturise their skin as well as Melania Trump, although, increasingly appalled with the racism he saw in the Trump White House, he instructed me: “We are never to talk about her again. She is nouveau riche trash.”He loved Jackie Kennedy’s style but turned on her when he learned that she had snubbed Ann Lowe, the black designer of her wedding dress, calling Lowe simply “a coloured dressmaker”.“I don’t like Jackie O,” he said. “She is now Jackie No.”Not sweetWhen André was spending the night with me for that inaugural, he got the flu and ended up staying for five days. I cleared out of my bedroom and gave him my queen-size bed. He glowered at the closet that was too stuffed to close and barked at me to remove a hat from the wall, a broad-brim, pink-ribbon number that I’d worn to Easter Mass when I was little.“Your look is not sweet,” he bellowed. “It is equestrian S\u0026ampM!”He missed his own tiger-stencilled sheets, and he called me Bad Nurse. He kept me running with his requests for chicken noodle soup, Georgetown Cupcakes, chocolate milk and turkey chilli.“Yes, I am difficult,” he said, “but I am loyal to a fault.”As his friend Diane von Furstenberg told me, when Vreeland’s eyesight failed her late in life, André went to that famous red apartment and read to her. His loyalty was not always returned by those he had assumed were his best friends in the throwaway world of fashion.“People turn on you in an eyelash blink,” he said to me, sadly.He described his sojourn leaving his size-18 Uggs beside my bed as “sheer joy and mayhem”, and he was right. We lounged in bed and watched old French movies and analysed the allure of French movie stars from the ’60s. (His favourite was Jeanne Moreau in Eva, where she flayed her lover with a riding crop.)One Christmas, to celebrate our love of movies, he gave me a special gift he’d gotten at auction: Joan Crawford’s sable coat, with “JC” embroidered inside.

Wakeford, a 37-year-old former insurance broker, who was elected as Conservative MP for Derby South in 2019, made his dramatic departure declaring Boris Johnson and his party incapable of providing leadership in the wake of the furore over parties at No 10.Whatever the motivation, nearly all those in the small defectors’ club of MPs say they have no regrets about breaking the ultimate political taboo.Westminster might love the drama of an MP crossing the floor, but what is the human impact on the “traitors” who abandon their tribe – and on the morale of those left behind? Can they ever find a home among politicians and activists who once saw them as the enemy, or are they always viewed with suspicion? Wakeford himself has said the decision to abandon Johnson’s party for that of Sir Keir Starmer was the most difficult of his life. Clearly shaken by the experience, he admitted to sleepless nights and stumbled over his new leader’s name in his first public event as a Labour MP, momentarily giving the impression he was now serving “Keir Llama”. For Woodward too, the decision was a traumatic one – “seismic,” he says - with his departure accelerated, as, allegedly, with Wakeford, by the Whips’ Office attempting to blackmail him into toeing the line.  “I just thought – this is horrible this is not why I came into politics. So I reached out to friends in the Labour Party and said: ‘I don’t think I am going to stay in the Conservative Party.’”“I am very conscious of the people I hurt. But I didn’t go because I would be well received, I went because I couldn’t possibly stay.”Baroness Nicholson, who as Emma Nicholson crossed the floor from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats in 1995, agrees: “I suddenly flipped,” she told Radio 4’s Today programme this week. “I was getting sick and tired of John Major’s vacillation on the European issue. I could suddenly take it no longer.“The worst thing about changing political parties is that you hurt people, and you hurt people who you love dearly, admire, respected, even fought with, but you hurt them very much indeed, and to live with that hurt is really, really difficult.”Like Woodward, who was dismayed by what he saw as the abandonment by Hague of One Nation Toryism, former Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Berger considers that her party left her, rather than the other way round. In 2019 she co-founded The Independent Group in response to what she viewed as a failure to act against anti-Semitism under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership this later became a new political party, Change UK, before Berger eventually joined the Liberal Democrats.“It was horrific to leave my political home of 20 years,” she reflects, “but in my mind it didn’t in any way represent the values that led me to it in the first place, so I could no longer be a part of it.“I absolutely made the right decision and I don’t have any regrets and I would do it again.” Jumping ship used to be a far more common affair – Winston Churchill decamped from the Conservatives to the Liberal Party in 1904, not returning to the fold for two decades. But even then “ratting” was a high stakes game. When a group of Labour MPs resigned the whip to join Oswald Mosley’s fascist New Party in 1931, two quit after a day to become independents.In recent years, defecting has proven something of a kamikaze mission of the 23 MPs who crossed the floor in the last 30 years, all but four lost their seats at the next election, Berger among them. Of the four who survived, two – including Woodward – had been offered safer seats than those they had won under a different party’s banner.The only two to have triumphed again at the ballot box are Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who quit the Conservatives for the UK Independent Party in 2014 crucially, both took the decision to resign as MPs and stand again in a by-election (Reckless, however, lost at the next general election).Carswell says the decision to fight a by-election was partly tactical, to put maximum pressure on then-prime minister David Cameron to hold a referendum on the question of Britain’s membership of the European Union, but also a matter of principle. Carswell’s defection was greeted relatively positively by both the voters and his party activists in his constituency of Clacton, with many in his local association following him to Ukip. To his surprise, most of his former Conservative colleagues in Parliament also remained on friendly terms.“I think they had respect for the fact that I had submitted myself to a by-election,” he says. “Had I not done that, they would have seen it as a case of getting elected under their colours then abandoning them.”That’s not to say that Carswell didn’t find the process emotional.“Anyone who is leaving one party for another is going to find difficulties. The only way to neutralise that is to resign and call a by-election.”Woodward, however, disagrees. “If you think that every time somebody crosses the floor there should be a by-election then Parliament should change the law. It shouldn’t be a reaction to one inidual’s actions. At the moment we still put the name of the candidate on the ballot paper – not the party.”Saying that, Woodward admits he felt far more comfortable in the Labour Party once he fought a general election in his new seat of St Helens. This, he says, helped him to get away from the disapproval of his former activists in his former constituency of true blue Whitney.Of Wakeford he says: “Actually, I think if he stood for a by-election, he’d probably win.” Additional reporting by Eleanor Steafel Rosa Prince is editor of The House magazineMore from NewsPrince Charles: Britain must restore its lost hedgerows that form a \u0026#39vital part of the landscape\u0026#39Magistrates adopt bricks and mortar approach to find more erse recruitsSue Gray to examine Boris Johnson’s official diary as part of ‘partygate’ probeNumber 10 police questioned by Sue Gray over Downing Street partiesCouple suing US state after being refused adoption services because they were JewishWhile Boris hangs on, poison is spreading through the Tory partyMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc licence fees days could numbered two thirds britons want","story":"Nearly two thirds of the public back the abolition of the BBC licence fee, as the vast majority claim it offers poor value for money, an exclusive poll has revealed.The survey of 2,488 people, conducted after the Government announced its plans to freeze the levy, showed overwhelming support for the Culture Secretary’s proposals to shake up BBC funding and to replace the fee with a voluntary subscription.Only 23 per cent disagreed when asked if the £159-a-year licence fee should be abolished and replaced with a voluntary subscription only paid if they watched BBC programmes, according to the survey by pollsters Find Out Now and Electoral Calculus.By contrast, 42 per cent agreed strongly that it should be scrapped and a further 21 per cent agreed “somewhat”.

The BBC had pleaded for the levy to rise in line with inflation, to allow it to compete with the likes of Netflix, under the new five-year settlement, which runs until 2027.However, the Culture Secretary has also hinted that the licence fee could be scrapped in five years. John Whittingdale, a former culture secretary, has proposed replacing the fee with a government grant, with viewers paying a voluntary subscription for entertainment and sport He said that the rollout of superfast broadband would ultimately allow viewers to “switch off” the BBC and pay only for programmes they wanted to view.Chris Holbrook, the chief executive of Find Out Now, said that streaming subscriptions appeared to have “tipped the balance against the BBC licence fee”.Martin Baxter, the chief executive of Electoral Calculus, said: “The public thinks the TV Licence is too high and is bad value for money. Most people would prefer a subscription-style arrangement instead of the current licence fee.”Younger viewers were more likely to say the BBC licence fee was very bad value than older people, a difference attributed to their wider use of Netflix and Amazon. Most 18- to 24-year-olds, 52 per cent, said it was very bad value versus 40 per cent of over 65s.There was also a political ide, with 60 per cent of Leave voters thinking that the BBC was very bad value for money versus 32 per cent of Remain voters. Half of Conservative voters said it was very bad value for money, as did 41 per cent of Labour voters. This compared with just 22 per cent of Liberal Democrats supporters.More than a third of respondents, 38 per cent, thought that the licence fee should be free, and two thirds said it should be no more than £100. Fewer than one person in every five believed it should be more than £150.There was also a class ide, with those in the AB social groups more likely to say that the corporation offered worse value for money.Of those in professional AB classes, 36 per cent said it offered very bad value compared with 43 per cent for C1 lower middle class households, 58 per cent for the C2 skilled working class and 61 per cent for DE working class and unemployed.A BBC spokesman said: “We trust longstanding, independent research, which shows the licence fee remains the preferred way of funding the BBC. We will continue to deliver brilliant content and work to provide great value to audiences across the UK. “We actively look forward to the national debate on the next Charter when, of course, all options should be considered.”More from NewsPrince Charles: Britain must restore its lost hedgerows that form a \u0026#39vital part of the landscape\u0026#39Magistrates adopt bricks and mortar approach to find more erse recruitsSue Gray to examine Boris Johnson’s official diary as part of ‘partygate’ probeNumber 10 police questioned by Sue Gray over Downing Street partiesCouple suing US state after being refused adoption services because they were JewishWhile Boris hangs on, poison is spreading through the Tory partyMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"convalescence making comeback not time","story":"From the rhythms of our working lives and the places where we live, to the way we occupy our leisure hours and even shop for groceries – there is no aspect of our lives that has not been affected by the global pandemic.Some of these changes have been baleful: the damage to the arts, to the hospitality industry and education will not easily be repaired.

The term “imperialism” is terribly imprecise. Should we define it in Lenin’s terms as the “highest stage of capitalism”? But then much will depend on what we mean by capitalism, and empires have been around much longer than that. Woke enthusiasts for critical race theory may mention the world empire created by sixteenth-century Spain, without saying anything about the empires created by the Aztecs and the Incas on the backs of other native peoples of the Americas. Instead, the term “imperialism” has become attached to the empires created by Portugal, Spain, Holland, France and Britain, each of which had a very distinctive character.But imperialism seems to be on the way back. Over the last few centuries, Russia and China conquered peoples and carved out their borders in competition for the Eurasian landmass, and even now tensions occasionally erupt between them along the Amur River in western Siberia.Tension in and around the South China Sea is nothing new, either: in the fifteenth century the famous eunuch admiral Zheng He managed to bring Java to heel, and established a base at Melaka in what is now Malaysia. China’s “Belt and Road’ strategy frequently cites Zheng He’s voyages, and has resulted in the creation of naval bases at Gwadar and Djibouti, in waters where Zheng He sailed. Djibouti is highly desirable: it commands the straits leading into the Red Sea, and Gwadar in Pakistan, close to the Persian Gulf, is the intended terminus of a railway running all the way to Beijing.The echoes of the past are also becoming louder in eastern Europe. What nineteenth-century historians called the “Eastern Question” has been revived as Vladimir Putin sits tight in Crimea, contemplates an invasion of Ukraine and continues to offer support to the brutal regime in Belarus.Will a contrived border incident spark a war that results in the fall of Kyiv? That would echo the moment in 1939 when Germany and Russia suddenly became allies and decided to carve up Poland. The Russian claim to Ukraine is based on a particular reading of history where the foundation of a principality around Kyiv in the tenth century is seen as the birth of Mother Russia. In Soviet days it was considered unwise to emphasise that the founders of the principality were Viking warriors from the Baltic rather than Slavs.But where are the voices on the woke Left denouncing Putin’s attempt to sew back the disjointed fragments of the Soviet Union, something that can only be described as a new brand of imperialism? They only seem to care about imperialism if Britain or the like can be held responsible. If they think about the present day at all, it is to attack a country such as Israel. Those activists who argue that the West Bank settlements are illegal say nothing about the legality of the occupation of Crimea.We thought that we were living in an age when the forcible acquisition of territory based on obsolete historical claims should no longer be possible. The Baltic States are understandably nervous, particularly when Moscow makes noises about the Russian-speaking populations in their countries. Having travelled by road across the Baltic states three years ago, I wonder whether the surprising narrowness of the roads linking them is a deliberate defensive move intended to slow the advance of an invading army – if so, a wise precaution.To the woke, though, they are far-off countries of which they know nothing. As the world seems to be building up towards what has been described as potentially the gravest crisis since the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, far-Left activists gleefully concentrate on the evils of vanished empires created several centuries ago, and obstinately ignore one that is being recreated on Europe’s doorstep at this very moment.David Abulafia is professor of history at the University of CambridgeMore from NewsPrince Charles: Britain must restore its lost hedgerows that form a \u0026#39vital part of the landscape\u0026#39Magistrates adopt bricks and mortar approach to find more erse recruitsSue Gray to examine Boris Johnson’s official diary as part of ‘partygate’ probeNumber 10 police questioned by Sue Gray over Downing Street partiesCouple suing US state after being refused adoption services because they were JewishWhile Boris hangs on, poison is spreading through the Tory partyMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"women children first onto titanic lifeboats myth historian claims","story":"It is one of the most enduring sentiments of a seemingly lost age of chivalry: “Women and children first.”However, the most famous application of that rule, on board the sinking Titanic, was in fact a myth, according to a historian.Claes-Goran Wetterholm, an author and expert on the doomed ocean liner, said it was “not true” that women and children survived thanks to the gallantry of men.Of the last survivors escaping on the final lifeboats leaving the starboard side of the ship, he said, the majority were men.Speaking to The Mail on Sunday’s You magazine to promote a new exhibition about the shipwreck in London’s Docklands, Mr Wetterholm said it is important to look again at the tragedy to “dispel some of the myths”.The exhibition will display 200 artefacts that belonged to passengers and crew on the Titanic, as well as recreate rooms on the ship to “submerge visitors in an unforgettable journey to the past”.Asked about the public obsession with the 1912 disaster, which still captures the public imagination 110 years on thanks to the blockbuster film starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, Mr Wetterholm suggested there were still new stories worth telling.The Swedish curator of the exhibition told the magazine it is “important to look again at the tragedy and dispel some of the myths”, including the notion of “women and children first”.The order, which famously came from the captain, was interpreted differently by officers on different sides of the ship, he said.“While the story goes that those who survived were women and children, it’s not true: 323 men survived, 80 per cent of them got on lifeboats from the starboard side.“They survived because first officer William Murdoch, who evacuated that side, didn’t prevent them from getting in.“On the port side, second officer Charles Lightoller had the rule of women and children first and he took it literally.“One boat that could take 65 people rowed away with 28, leaving men behind. Over on the starboard side, it was a different story. On the last boats to leave, the majority were men.”Other common misconceptions include the nationality of passengers. According to Mr Wetterholm: “The fifth-largest passenger group were Arabs. They came from Syria and Lebanon in search of new lives, travelling by boat to join the Titanic at Cherbourg.”The claim follows research at Sweden’s Uppsala University in 2012, in which economists produced an 82-page study about the survivors of shipwrecks.It showed that captains and their crew are 18.7 per cent more likely to survive a sinking ship than their passengers, with “every man for himself” a more appropriate description than “women and children first”.The study of 18 maritime disasters from 1852 to 2011 showed that, of the 15,000 people who died, only 17.8 per cent of the women survived compared with 34.5 per cent of the men.Titanic: The Exhibition has been seen by three million people during its tour of museums, and is now at Dock X London where the 200 objects are on show in Britain for the first time. The  awarded the exhibition three stars.A separate book is also seeking to overturn the previous understanding that a wireless operator aboard the ship nearest to the sinking Titanic could have saved lives.Cyril Evans, who manned the telegraph equipment on the SS Californian 60 miles away from the Titanic, could not have saved the victims even if he had been awake to receive the distress calls, according to the authors.Mr Evans went to bed at 11.30pm on Apr 14 1912, with a US inquiry later finding that had he “remained a few minutes longer at his post”, the Californian “might have had the proud distinction of rescuing the lives of the passengers and crew”.“In short, had Evans received Titanic’s distress call, it would have already foundered and most of the people in the water would have died from cold shock and exposure before Californian arrived.”More from NewsPrince Charles: Britain must restore its lost hedgerows that form a \u0026#39vital part of the landscape\u0026#39Magistrates adopt bricks and mortar approach to find more erse recruitsSue Gray to examine Boris Johnson’s official diary as part of ‘partygate’ probeNumber 10 police questioned by Sue Gray over Downing Street partiesCouple suing US state after being refused adoption services because they were JewishWhile Boris hangs on, poison is spreading through the Tory partyMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic raab plays down reports","story":"Dominic Raab plays down reports mandatory NHS jabs could be delayed by  monthsAs it stands, in two weeks NHS workers will be expected to prove their vaccination status, with February  the last day they can book their jab\" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES n _World-Wide-Rally-For-Freedom-London-Protest.jpg\" width\"\" \"\" Protesters unhappy about compulsory vaccination for NHS workers Image: Getty ImagesByRachel WearmouthSenior Political Correspondent:,  Jan | comments Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab played down reports that mandatory jabs for NHS workers could be delayed by six months amid growing anger over the move. According to the , Boris Johnson is preparing to put back the April  deadline.As it stands, in two weeks NHS workers will be expected to prove their vaccination status, with February  the last day they can book their jab. On February , those without jabs will face dismissal warnings. They will then be asked to work their notice periods until March . More than , NHS staff are thought to not be jabbed, but many angry about threats to their jobs joined anti-vaxx protests over the weekend.Speaking on the BBC ’s Sunday Morning programme, Mr Raab said: “Nine out of  NHS staff have now come forward and had their vaccine. That is critically important. “I do think that we continue to call for thoseto come forward to be boosted or vaccinated before the deadline but I think ultimately we have to make sure that we don’t have people putting patients at riskthey are not vaccinated.“The deadline is there to protect the most vulnerable in our hospitals but we have got the resilience because we have got nearly , more doctors, nearly , more nurses than we did in .”Pat Cullen, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said the deadline for mandatory jabs should be delayed or the policy will “backfire”. She said: “Nothing matters more to a nurse than caring for their patients safely. “Right now, our members are telling me they can’t always do that. “We are calling on the Government to recognise this risk and delay a move which by its own calculations looks to backfire.  “To dismiss valued nursing staff during this crisis would be an act of self-sabotage.” Danny Mortimer, deputy chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents organisations within the health service, said: “When we consulted our members, they told us that they would have preferred longer to implement the policy. “However they are working hard to prepare for the deadline and are continuing to focus on encouraging and persuading hesitant staff to get vaccinated to protect themselves and others. “We do have to acknowledge that as the deadline approaches some frontline staff will have to leave their present rolesthey continue to decline to be vaccinated.” Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry said that a delay should be considered. Speaking on Sky News’s Trevor Phillips On Sunday, she said: “There is discussion about putting off the deadline, andwe are going to put off the deadline, then we need to work with the hospitals and with the trade union movement about how it is that we can convince as many people as possible who work within the health service to get themselves vaccinated. “Nobody who works in the National Health Service comes into the service for the money but in order to make sure they help others. “Arguments need to be put before them to say you are not helping others by not being vaccinated.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSBoris JohnsonHospitalsPoliticsCoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineDominic Raab MP\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It comes as the PM is braced for the publication of senior civil servant Sue Gray’s report into rule-busting parties at Downing Street during lockdown, with scores of MPs poised to turn against him. According to the Mail on Sunday, Mr Sunak, who has remained tight-lipped about his embattled boss, spoke with MPs and hinted at a timetable for launching a challenge.The Chancellor is thought to be in competition with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss for backers as leadership hopefuls aim to build support on the down-low. One MP told The Mail on Sunday: “My impression is that Liz wants to go for it now, while Rishi would prefer for all this fuss to die down and run in the summer.” Another source suggested the Chancellor made clear Red Wall MPs would have “unlimited” Treasury support. They added: “He didn’t mention the leadership, but he didn’t have to - he made clear that they would be safe in his hands.”Meanwhile, aides and ministers - including Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who insiders say cancelled a rail visit in Manchester on Friday - have been drafted in to help Mr Johnson draw up a spreadsheet of wavering MPs.Shapps cancelled the visit on Friday but the visit was due to take place on Monday.

Michael Fabricant MP for Lichfield in Staffordshire has said Nusrat Ghaniaposs accusation stinks and he believes the timing of her claim is interesting. Ms Ghani told the Sunday Times she was sacked as transport minister in  as a Government whip had said her faith was making colleagues uncomfortable. She considered quitting politics after the whip said her Muslimness was raised as an issue at a Downing Street meeting [in March ]. The whip also said her Muslim woman minister status was making colleagues feel uncomfortable, and questioned her loyalty to the Party. Since she spoke out on Saturday night, Downing Street hit back and claimed Boris Johnson had met with Ms Ghani after her claims and he encouraged her to make a formal complaint.Mr Fabricant told LBC that itaposs open season on the whips office but open season on Boris Johnson to get him to resign.Prejudice of any kind in modern Britain is pretty pathetic. It was pathetic  years ago, itaposs even more pathetic now when this sort of thing happens, he told Andrew Pierce on the radio station.But, you know, ministers they come and they go, sometimes itaposs because you want to refresh the ministerial team. Sometimes itaposs because they were useless sometimes because theyaposre just average and mediocre and you want to put somebody .I think the whole thing actually stinks. The accusation being made by Nus Ghani. I mean, I have to say that someone had said itaposs because sheaposs a Muslim. I mean, sheaposs hardly someone whoaposs obviously a Muslim. I had no idea what religion she is. Mr Fabricant then references the Labour MP Keith Vaz who is also of Asian descent and highlights that he was a Goan Christian. He has been cheerleading for the PM throughout partygate and as more and more scandal hits the Conservative party.Last week, Mr Fabricant claimed allegations of bullying and intimidation from the whips office was “nonsense”.“If I reported every time I had been threatened by a whip ora whip reported every time I had threatened them, the police wouldn’t have any time to conduct any other police work,” Mr Fabricant said.

The terrible tales we tell today of people struggling to make ends meet are before April’s rocketing fuel bills start accelerate beyond recent rises, tightening the financial screw on people already struggling to stretch incomes to cover higher living costs. The year of the squeeze, , will force more folk to choose between eating and heating as poverty kills men and women in one of the earth’s richest countries. It doesn’t have to be this way. It’s a choice by the Conservative Government. And it’s a scandal that must be challenged, forcing the Tories into another U-turn – this time suspending VAT on energy bills, giving extra help to low earners and cancelling a hefty National Insurance tax rise.  Dignied, heroic Jack Mortimer and the others deserve our support. Out the bigots The sickening bigotry, prejudice and racism within the Conservative Party exposed by MP and sacked Minister Nusrat Ghani’s explosive claim her Muslim religion was why she was sacked from Boris Johnson’s Government is utterly repellent. Deep nauseating schisms exposed in the Tories by the unacceptable discrimination, Health and Education Secretaries Sajid Javid and Nadhim Zahawi speaking in support of Ghani while Downing Street and loyal backbencher Michael Fabricant add insults to injury, mustn’t be ignored.  This ugly scandal cannot be dealt with by the Conservative Party or Parliament. The Equality and Human Rights Commission must launch a formal inquiry into evidence that bigotry against Muslims is unlawfully polluting the governing party.

I was part of the Re:Act Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. The NHS was under the cosh at the time and I was part of the RE:ACT Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. I helped build the Nightingale hospitals in Wales and also worked with the local council in Hereford to distribute PPE. Now I’m at the pop-up vaccination centre in Hereford. There are two of us here who are ex-military – the other guy is an ex-submariner so we’ve got a broad range of skills. There’s not a lot that comes across our path that bamboozles us.The first time I volunteered was on a day off from work. We were tasked with letting people know about the vaccination centre, but of course we didn’t want to browbeat them so we let people come to us. Initially people thought we were giving out lateral flow tests – we’d say, No, we’re here for boosters or your first or second vaccination. It was quiet for the first hour, but word obviously spread around Hereford and by the end of the day I’d say we’d vaccinated about  people, from schoolkids upwards. I think . per cent of people were happy to have a vaccination. I thought: Evenyou get five people vaccinated, that’s five people who won’t suffer.” Yes, you might catch it, but you’re much less likely to end up in hospital. When people ask meI think it works, I feel like I can provide the back story for them.We’ve now even had people come in for their first jabs. I asked one, What changed your mind  He said,Omicron, because it’s more infectious’. I just said, “Well done.”So while I don’t strong-arm people, I do tell them, “I think you should get vaccinated. ‘We all need the booster so that le can get back to normal’  I joined the Royal Air Force in  and my last posting was out in Cyprus, but I always wanted to transition to a career in the NHS. Back in October  I joined the East of England Covid- mass vaccination programme and my first role was to provide support in the planning and delivery of large-scale centres, hospital hubs and community pharmacies. Now I’m working as the children’s project manager, leading and coordinating plans. This involves collating, analysing and improving plans, reporting to the programme director and the national team, using my past experiences to collaborate, advise and implement processes.  I’m good at seeing a problem and thinking outside the box to solve it. I can get parachuted into a project within the Covid- programme and am able to run with it. Every day is dferent, but that doesn’t faze me. I’m very adaptable and flexible – and I’ll give  per cent to achieving the common goal. Working with other people from the Forces means there’s a great sense of camaraderie. We share the same service ethos. If there’s a deadline, we’ll just knuckle down and get the job done. This is not a - job. Even though I might have to get up at .am to jump on a work call, I have no problem with that. I was motivated to join the Covid- programme by my sense of duty, and I’m really proud to be part of it. I have a passion for helping people and making sure things are completed to the highest standard. This gives me a real sense of achievement. I like being able to make a dference. The public response to getting boosted has been great, but there is still a long way to go. I believe the Get Boosted Now campaign is so important because we need to protect ourselves, the vulnerable and the future generations. We also need to get everyone boosted so we can get le back to normal as soon as possible. ‘One of my ex-soldiers gave me the Covid- jab’  I was  when I joined the Navy as a medic. It was the year after the Falklands War and I thought I’d like to get involved in something for the service of the country – to do what’s necessary when the time comes. As a Navy medic I was trained to deal with trauma from the very basic things up to the most drastic ones you could think of, like gunshots and traumatic amputations. After  years, I left in  to join the Army, then in  I moved to the NHS. During the pandemic I was initially asked to oversee the distribution of PPE. There were shortages across the board, and having worked overseas with the Royal Marines, my logistics knowledge came to the fore. I could make sure community midwives and health visitors had what they needed. In some cases this entailed doing the deliveries myself in the van!  For me, the pleasure in the role was being able to provide medical staff with the assurance that they would have the equipment they needed. I felt I was making a real dference. When the time came to get my Covid- jab, it was one of my former soldiers who gave me it. That was very impressive because when I met him he was , wide-eyed and fresh out of the box. When I next met him he was teaching the volunteers and St John’s Ambulance staff how to administer the vaccine. I was full of admiration for him. He’d stepped up as a young man and was teaching much more mature iniduals. But I wasn’t surprised – that’s what we expected our troops to do: step into the breach, wherever the breach happens to be. You can’t praise the veterans highly enough for getting involved in the vaccine campaign. They will serve their community in whatever circumstances, whether it’s dficult or easy. You’ve got a group of people who drop everything as soon as they’re asked, regardless of what their family commitment might be, and go and do the job. I don’t think there is a better resource for the country to draw upon.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON British ArmyRoyal Air ForceNHSRoyal MarinesFalklands WarNigel JonesJake WadeHelen RobertsHospitalsSoldiersArmed forcesTeenagersThe FalklandsMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"cyclists told ride middle road","story":"Cyclists told to ride in the middle of road in major Highway Code shake-upA major shake-up to the Highway Codes come in to force later this month, and people face a £ finethey dont follow the new rules £ - with cyclists facing the biggest alternationsMany are concerned about the changes Image: Getty ImagesByEmma MunbodhMoney EditorZoe ForseyFeatures Editor:,  Jan | commentsCyclists are being advised to ride in the middle of the road in some situations as part of a huge shake-up to the Highway Code. Riders will be advised to take the new position instead of the left-hand side of the lane when approaching junctions and on quiet roads. This rule remains in place eventhere is a cycle lane, which they are not obliged to use. The rules favour cyclists and pedestrians over drivers in a new hierarchy of road users, with the logic that they are the ones who can cause the least harm. But critics have warned the changes, which come into affect at the end of the month pending final approval, could cause accidents and tension between drivers and cyclists. Another new rule stats that drivers must leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists. The positioning of cyclists is just one of many new changes announced by the Department of Transport, with those who donapost follow the rules facing tougher £ fines and six points for motorists.Bosses at road safety charity IAM RoadSmart are concerned the changes could cause an increase of road rage. Director of policy and research Neil Greig told The Times: A lot of drivers are going to think that somebody cycling in the middle of the lane in front of them is doing it to deliberately slow them down. That leads to conflict and road rage and inappropriate overtaking. Everybody needs to know all of these changes at the same time for it to work. The Highway Code shake-up will also see a change to how drivers use roundabouts, and for the first time the law will require those who can do the greatest harm to others to have a higher level of responsibility to reduce the danger. Rule  under the new section says people on the road will need to give priority to cyclists at roundabouts - Bristol Live reports.It states: You should give priority to cyclists on the roundabout. They will be travelling more slowly than motorised traffic. Give them plenty of room and do not attempt to overtake them within their lane. Allow them to move across your path as they travel around the roundabout. Cyclists, horse riders and horse drawn vehicles may stay in the left-hand lane when they intend to continue across or around the roundabout and should signal right to show you they are not leaving the roundabout. Drivers should take extra care when entering a roundabout to ensure that they do not cut across cyclists, horse riders or horse drawn vehicles in the left-hand lane, who are continuing around the roundabout.  It is a driveraposs responsibility to remain up-to-date with changes to the Highway Code, but the AA found in a survey last month that only a third of motorists were aware of the amendment.Charity campaigners have issued a warning to the government the new rules have not been promoted widely enough. Cycling UKaposs Duncan Dollimore said: Many people wonapost have read the Highway Code for years so itaposs essential that the key changes are clearly explained, with simple, accurate and memorable messages.A DfT spokesman said: The proposed upcoming changes to the Highway Code will improve safety for cyclists, pedestrians and horse riders and were announced to national press.The department has established a working group of key organisations to ensure that messages about the changes are as widespread as possible and our well-established Think! campaign will continue to ensure all road users are aware both when these changes come into effect and beyond.

The first incident took place on December  when a -year-old child was followed after getting off a bus in on Hoveton Road. The man sexually touched her before running away when the victim screamed, police say. Three more attacks took place in mid-January. A police statement added: On Wednesday,  January, a -year-old girl was walking down Poplar Place, SE when she was approached by a man asking for directions. He pushed her against a fence and sexually touched her before she screamed and was able to run away.  On Thursday,  January, a -year-old girl was followed off the  bus by a man at Artillery Place, SE. He followed her into a nearby property and grabbed the back of her leg, causing her to fall. As she was on the floor he sexually touched her and ran from the scene when the victim shouted for help. On Tuesday,  January, a -year-old girl was walking down Kentlea Road, SE, when she was approached by a man who asked for directions. As she attempted to walk away, he sexually touched her before she was able to escape. DS James Robinson, who is leading the investigation, has asked anyone with information to make themselves known. “We know these incidents will cause concern within the community and we are doing all we can to identy the person responsible, he said. “We are also asking for your help –you recognise the man in this image or have any information that could assist us, no matter how small, then contact us as soon as possible.” Anyone with information should call  with CAD reference  JAN or Crimestoppers  per cent anonymously on   .

Melissa Williams, , from Liverpool, ended up with a mass the size of a rugby ball in her stomach after eating her own hair whenever she felt anxious.Doctors were forced to cut the tangled hair into four sections before they could remove each one, the Liverpool Echo reports. Her family is now speaking out about her condition, known as Rapunzel Syndrome, in a bid to raise awareness.The hairball in Melissaaposs stomach, which measured between eight and cm in diameter, was removed on October , . Mum Jackie Williams, , and dad, Gary Jones, , didnapost know anything was wrong until Melissa started complaining of severe stomach pains.  Jackie explained she took her daughter to and from the GP over the course of a year but carried on persisting when they told her that Melissaaposs problems were due to anxiety.She told The ECHO: She was getting really badly bullied at school for three years and when she would get anxious she would pull out her own hair and eat it.The first things we noticed were that she was feeling and being sick, had poor appetite and lost about one stone in weight. I thought she had an eating disorder because she wasnapost eating. She started getting sent home from school a lot and asking not to go in because she felt sick, but because it was on the same day every week I thought it was a lesson she didnapost like.  We were to and from the doctors about half a dozen times over the year but we carried on persisting.The pain got signicantly worse over a two week period and Jackie decided to take Melissa to Alder Hey Childrenaposs Hospital.Once at the hospital, doctors could feel Melissaaposs stomach was tender. They then found a huge mass, but didnapost know what it was. Jackie said: They said they had never seen this before, they did an X-ray and they saw a big mass in her stomach but didnapost know what it was. It was actually my neighbour that said she read something years ago about people eating their hair, and thataposs what it was. Melissa went into emergency surgery at Alder Hey where doctors had to cut the hairball into four sections before removing each of them with two hands, due to their weight.Jackie continued: The doctors saidwe didnapost take Mel in when we did she might not have pulled through the surgery. She was relieved once the pain was gone and she was so brave. After the surgery, Melissa was in hospital for two weeks due to issues with her bloods and excess fluid in her stomach. Melissa was then well enough tohome for four weeks before ending up in hospital again with three dferent infections. Melissa does still pull out her hair sometimes but no longer eats it. She is being supported by Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services . Now her family want to raise awareness of Rapunzel Syndrome and make sure other parents know the signs and symptoms to look out for. Jackie said: Parents should look out for any changes in their kidsapos hair, and itaposs not just the hair on their head. It can be eyelashes and eyebrows. Also any changes to eating, sickness and stomach pains are all symptoms.

Rapunzel Syndrome is an extremely rare intestinal condition in humans resulting from ingesting hair. The syndrome is named after the long-haired girl Rapunzel in the fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. This syndrome occurs when the trichobezoarreaches past the small intestine, and sometimes even into the colon. Characteristics of the syndrome include a hairball in the stomach, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting and a Vitamin B deficiency.

The -year-old admits her home leaves all her visitors shivering and her family worried she’ll get pneumonia. But Diane says these are the s she has to go, to keep those rising energy bills down. The mum-of-six and gran to seven, has seen her energy bills soar by % in recent months from £ to £. Speaking from her frosty ground floor flat in Tulse Hill, South London, she said: “A neighbour came in yesterday and I noticed she was shivering. “I said ‘I’m really sorry. Let’s move into the living room’, where the temperature was not much dferent but the sun was shining in.” The Mirror is calling for VAT on energy bills to be scrapped as rocketing prices look set to push millions into poverty. Former NHS worker Diane gets £ to live on after her rent is paid from her state pension and is dreading the energy bill rises to come.“I live in the cold. My hands are freezing at the moment. Quite often my nose is cold like a dog’s. My kids are worried I will get pneumonia. “My daughters won’t bring the kids around because my house is so cold. They worry about me getting diseases or stuff too. “ Since the pandemic Diane only ventures out to get her prescriptions because she is asthmatic and has been shielding so does not spend any money on luxuries. “I’m very worried the bills are going up because I can’t live any more frugally than I already live,” she explained. “I already don’t turn the heating on most days and I never ever turn the heating on at night. “On the very coldest days I put it on at pm and put the kitchen timer on for half an hour. There is a cold patch around about pm. “I’ve got a bath but I don’t do that a lot to be honest. I’m very low maintenance. “I mostly eat vegetables. I’ve got a gas kettle because electric kettles take up so much energy. “I’m just worried it’s going to be horrible. I have to have faith. I’m not the only one with trouble going on, they have to come up with a solution.”  Diane says she has tried other ways to heat her flat by blocking all the air vents and putting a big thick heavy curtain up but said it just causes condensation and black mould. “But I refuse to moan about it because when I was young we didn’t have gas central heating, when it got cold you just put a jumper on or do some exercise,” she said. But then admits: “At night it is very cold in here. “At the moment it’s only one degree at night and I can feel my head and my nose are absolutely verging on damp. I have to go down the bed under the sheets to get warm. “My old neighbour, who died, had a ‘noddy’ hat which he kept on all through winter. He used to sleep in it too. “Maybe I should get a hat.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSPensionsEnergy billsState pension\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But the reality of working for a high street bakery can be quite dferent. Christian Brayford worked at Greggs and revealed the secrets of the bakery and what staff have to deal with ion a daily basis. And he says the free food and drinks which come as a perk of the job were not worth the time, effort and aposextremely dficultapos circumstances workers faced. GrimsbyLive reports the realities of working at the High Street bakery where he worked at multiple locations. Hereaposs what he had to sayI worked at Greggs what feels like a millennium ago. In fact, it was only back in January  but world events and a global pandemic have caused time to seemingly stop in its wake.I really enjoyed the food - I still do now. I often go to the Greggs on Old Brumby Street for a pasty treat .Whenever Iaposm in Grimsby, Iaposll always nip in to the Victoria Street store for a pink jammie doughnut.I used to work at Greggs in Tadcaster, just off the A heading to York. At the time, I was a sht leader so I was in charge of cash handling, staff management, dealing with complaints, ordering stock, and banking at the end of the day.  The working hours could be extremely demanding. You had to be there at am on some shts, and usually you wouldnapost leave until after pm or later. And when you arrived for work, it was absolutely freezing. It was probably colder outside the shop than it was in it - without the exaggeration. This was back in January so in the early hours of the morning it was particularly icy and brisk. You werenapost allowed to wear a jumper either - you were provided with a Greggs hat, Greggs t-shirt, a kitchen apron and a hair net .  Breakfast is a huge part of Greggs and why people love it so much. The egg, sausage and omelette roll was always a firm favourite of mine - along with ketchup. At the start of the sht, youaposd have to put the delivery away. I found it odd that Greggs has two deliveries in a day - one in the very early hours of the morning and one in the afternoon. But this was dependant on the storeaposs location. Our store used to have a delivery at around am or am in the morning.  This was when youaposd have a delivery of all your sweet treats such as triple chocolate doughnuts, jam heart biscuits, Belgian buns and much more. We would spend time on the delivery and preparing for breakfast - ensuring enough trays of bacon, sausage and omelette were prepared for the busiest part of the day. And it was also the time that the bulk of sandwiches were made. So whether you like a roast chicken and bacon club sandwich, a tuna crunch baguette, or a chargrill chicken oval bite, this was the prime time that they were made. There was a specic guide, or cooking matrix, which had to be followed to incredible detail when preparing a sandwich. It came down to the right amount of sauce, the right amount of vegetable and the right amount of protein or meat. If you went over by the slightest margin, youaposd have to make the sandwich again. This is not to say that sandwiches werenapost made throughout the day because they were, whatever was running short or low, weaposd always have someone in the back preparing them from fresh.  Mostly all the items sold in Greggs are made in one of its factories, which are then transported to its stores to be refrigerated or to be kept frozen. All the pasties, cookies, sausages, croissants, pain au chocolates were frozen before cooking. The way to tell the dference with a Greggs pasty is by the design and shapes on its surface. For instance, a corned beef pasty has horizontal little lines across its surface. It never took long to cook them as the cookers were fantastically hot and very large to pack in almost everything you needed for the day. Drinks were always a nightmare, it would take what felt like an hour to prepare one when you had a queue so long and people getting very agitated for a sausage roll. And you always used to see the same people every day. That was always nice as you got to connect with people and have a bit of a chat and a laugh. But there were also times when it wasnapost great.  Especially when you had a man from Plymouth shouting in your face because you didnapost have any milk chocolate cookies available or when Peter from York couldnapost use a loyalty stamp that was out of date. I strongly sympathise and understand all customer service workers who go through similar things - but in dferent situations and environments - on a daily basis. It certainly made it harder to motivate yourself to get up in the morning. And the close down was always a nightmare. We would practice hygiene and cleaning throughout the day on a aposclean as you go basisapos but the shear volume of closing down was insane. It usually took over an hour to record the dayaposs banking, ensure all food beyond its use by date had been thrown away, and to clean the entire place from top to bottom. I know it doesnapost sound a lot, but it certainly felt like it after a demoralising sht of dealing with complaints, rudeness and a high demand for a cheese bake. But one of the glorious delights at the end of the day was being able to take food home. Youaposd be really surprised at how much food was wasted. It was literally a tonne of pure sausage rolls and baguettes and sweets. But it was great to decide which food you wanted to take home. Sometimes Iaposd walk out of the building with about four of five bags of food. It was great to see my familyaposs face when I brought them something back. My time at Greggs was very short lived, the first lockdown in March  put an end to my time there. When I was asked to go back in August , I kindly declined the offer and handed in my notice. So looking back at it now, was it all really worth it  The kindest answer is no. Even by the time the first lockdown was imposed, I felt like a walking zombie. The long hours were particularly draining. Sometimes youaposd be working five days on sht patterns of  hour days which can be demanding. The pay was hovering very close to the national minimum wage of around £. at the time. So you canapost really complain and grumble as it was a job. The free food at the end of the day was amazing - evenit impacted my waist line. But what really tipped me over the edge was the rudeness of customers. And I still see the similar kind of rudeness today but in a dferent shop. People can be so thoughtless and insensitive as to how their actions might be devastating or impact another person. The abuse was unjustied and uncalled for. But the saying goesthere isnapost a reason to complain, someone will find a reason too. I loved the food, but I donapost think the experience of working in a Greggs was all it is cracked up to be.

The internal document was posted on Welcome Nurseriesapos app and included a near escape, a boy getting stuck in the loo and a toddler left to sit with faeces on his leg. The company which owns Smarties in Enderby, Leicestershire, uses the app to keep parents up to date and inform them of any announcements.But it inadvertently uploaded a document informing parents of list of faux pas it had made, LeicestershireLive reports.It was quickly taken down and parents were informed it had been posted in error by a member of staff at the firmaposs head office. The biggest issue to emerge from the post was the fact that, in July , a child attending the West Street pre-school was found about to walk through a gate said to have been left open by a member of staff.  The company said a receptionist spotted the child thanks to the buildingaposs CCTV cameras and was able to intervene before the child walked through the gate and into the car park. A member of staff reported the incident to the then-manager and deputy manager. But it did not report the incident to the childaposs family, to head office or Ofsted, the company told The firm said head office was only made aware of the incident in early-January this year and had contacted the childaposs parents to inform them of what had happened. It says an investigation is ongoing into that and a number of other incidents - and a new management team is running the nursery now. They also acknowledged that staff members did not whistle-blow to superiors after realising the management had not reported the incident - with staff now retrained to report such issues in the future. A second issue mentioned in the letter admits that a pre-school boy was shut in the toilet for some time, leaving them visibly shaking and crying when let out.  The letter says the incident happened when a staff member was told to close the door to the bathroom to stop children running in and out. They did not check the cubicles to seeany children were on the toilet and this resulted in the boy being left behind the door. Welcome Nurseries said the door was accidentally closed while the child was in there, but when staff realised the he had not ed to the room, they went back to the bathroom and let him out. Other issues in the accidental post include reports of a staff member wiping babiesapos bottoms with antibacterial wipes instead of wet wipes, causing the babies to have sore, bleeding bottoms. A later investigation by the nursery did not support this allegation.  A cook was reported to have been left to supervise pre-school children alone with no qualications to do so, and a child in soiled nappy was left unattended for so long that faeces was stuck to his leg and took  minutes to remove. One parent whose child attends the nursery, who wishes to be anonymous, said: The entire post is very worrying, but my child attends the nursery section so I am particularly concerned that a member of staff was using antibacterial wipes on the babiesapos bottoms. I definitely havenapost been told about it and only found out due to the letter. We have to provide our own baby wipes so there was literally no excuse for them to use anything , they are completely dferent. They have covered staff mistakes up and we wouldnapost have known about itthe letter wasnapost posted. The nursery was already unreliable generally before this and had caused some concern, but hearing about a child escaping in the summer makes me worry , as a parent, will I find outmy child has been put at risk   A spokesperson for Welcome Nurseries has confirmed the management in charge of Smarties Nursery has changed since the incidents in question, and that the company was tackling the situation as a matter or urgency. An internal investigation is currently running to determine how and why the issues came about - including why the nurseryaposs management had not reported the issues to head office after being informed by staff members. The spokesperson said: We can confirm that we received an email of concern on the th January regarding alleged incidents that took place around July last year, under previous management. We can also confirm that we had no prior knowledge of the incidents until the email was sent to us. The safety and well-being of all our children are our number one priority and we immediately carried out a full investigation. It was alleged that a child managed to escape from the nursery into the car park. Whilst this allegation was unfounded, on investigation it was found that a gate was left open which was seen on CCTV by the receptionist, who acted immediately before the child went out of the gate. We also investigated further incidents which occurred around the same time in which a child was left in the bathroom on their own. Our investigation found that a child had entered the bathroom area and a member of staff not knowing he was there closed the door. Both incidents were reported to the previous management team who are no longer with the company, however these were not reported onward or investigated at the time. These incidents fall well below our standard of care and we have since retrained our staff. We are continuing to work with our parents and can assure all parents that we take all concerns seriously and act on them. We profusely apologise to all our children and parents that these incidents occurred and that we were not made aware of them sooner. We have not yet finished our investigations in this matter. We have a new management structure in place at the setting. We would also like to thank our parents for their continued support. A Leicestershire County Council spokesperson said: “We have very recently been made aware of concerns raised by a parent and will be working with the setting to ensure the appropriate procedures and policies are in place.

Dave Harvey was a bass player in a rock band when he fell suddenly ill at the age of . He was diagnosed with a genetic kidney disease and faced spending his le connected to a dialysis machine. But on December ,  he had a groundbreaking transplant operation at a London hospital. Medics predicted the organ - from a car crash victim - would last just  years. But grandfather-of-two Dave, now , says the kidney is still going strong after half a century.  He said: “I just feel so grateful. It really is the gt of le. “Fty years is absolutely remarkable even by today’s standards I think. “When I had the diagnosis, I was living the high le and having a great time, so to find out I had kidney disease was like having the rug pulled from under my feet. “Before my transplant, I was at home for three months at my parents’ place having dialysis. “I’m very lucky.”  Dave was diagnosed with Alport syndrome, which triggers progressive kidney disease, after suffering from extreme fatigue. The rocker says he “hated” dialysis, adding: “I don’t know how people cope being on dialysis for a long time.” On Boxing Day  he received a phone call saying there was a kidney available for him. Surgeons inserted the new organ to the left of his stomach - and left his existing kidneys in situ. The semi-retired stock auditor from Greenhithe, Kent, is now among the longest surviving transplant patients in the world. He is still in good health, visiting the gym three times weekly and enjoying regular holidays.  The transplant enabled him to meet and marry soulmate Anne, who died at the age of  eight years ago. The dad-of-two said: “I was apprehensive because the surgery was so new, but I trusted everybody. “It was the answer to getting off the kidney machine and I felt optimistic. “Afterwards I just felt such relief and gratitude. “I wanted to meet that person’s family but they don’t allow you to. “I want to show them how grateful I am, and that their son’s tragic loss wasn’t completely in vain.” Brit Angela Dunn is thought to be the longest-surviving transplant patient in the world. She is still enjoying a healthy le with the kidney she received on July , .

The Duke of York faces a civil trial in the US after a judge rejected his lawyersapos bid to block a sex abuse case launched by Virginia Giuffre. Ms Gufre claims Jeffrey Epstein forced her to have sex with the royal on three occasions when she was just . Andrew vehemently denies the claims. The Queen stripped her son of his military affiliations and royal patronages earlier this month in a decisive response to the scandal. He is also no longer allowed to use his HRHtitle in any official capacity.  However, a source close to Andrew has reportedly now claimed that his royal patronages could be restoredhe wins his civil case while the Queen is alive. They told The Times: I thinkthe Queen is still alive and his name is cleared I would say that at that point what reason would there be for him to be barred from taking part in royal duties. The associate believes Andrew is less likely to have his titles and patronages restoredhe is cleared when Charles is king. They added: It’s a dferent decision-maker and dferent people influencing him and therefore it’s slightly less predictable.  I think his brother is a very reasonable and intelligent person and I’m sure he will do what’s right for the royal family and for the country.” The source said they thought there was no reason Andrew could not use HRH and his military titles againhe is cleared in court. The associate believes Andrew will want to fight the claims in court to aposclear his nameapos, instead of reaching a settlement with Ms Giuffre.

They attend royal engagements and travel the world on tours, meeting thousands of people every year. But sometimes, when a royal is starting to fall out of favour, they may do other bits and bobs in a bid to win fans over - with dfering levels of success. In June , Prince Edward, who organised the event, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Fergie went head-to-head in a special episode of Itaposs a Royal Knockout. Each royal had a team, which was representing a dferent charity, made up of celebrities, including the late Meat Loaf, who competed in a number of dferent events.However, it didnapost go quite as they hoped and has since been described as a disaster from start to finish and one of the biggest c***-ups in the royal familyaposs history. Royal expert Ben Pimlott claims the Queen didnapost like the idea at all and all of her staff believed it would be a mistake. An insider told him: [The Queen] was against it, but one of her faults is that she canapost say no. Recalling the show on Channel aposs Fergie Vs Diana:Royal Wives at War, royal expert Jennie Bond said: Itaposs a Royal Knockout will go down in royal history as one of the biggest c**k-ups of all time I think. It was a disaster from beginning to end, it was absolutely humiliating. Sarah with her usual gusto entered into it, andshe gets into something she does it with bells on. However not all of the royal family took up the offer of taking part.  Speaking on the documentary, the Daily Mailaposs Richard Kay said: Diana famously didnapost take part, neither did Charles. He thought it was something that was beneath them. In a way, itaposs kind of unfair, Fergie took a lot of the blame, almost the scapegoat. Her behaviour was being commented on and I think, then, is when Diana came into her own. The show, which was filmed at Alton Towers, was hosted by Stuart Hall, Les Dawson and Su Pollard. Paul Daniels acted as the chief referee. Princess Anneaposs red team, raising cash for Save the Children, included Tom Jones, Clf Richard, actress Jenny Agutter, and athlete Deborah Flintoff. Fergie was joined by Michael Brandon, Ben Cross and Jane Seymour, while Prince Andrewaposs World Wildle Team included Gary Lineker, Margot Kidder, Rhys Jones and John Travolta. Meat Loaf, who passed away this week, also took part. Prince Edward was in charge of the yellow team, raising cash for the Duke of Edinburgh Scheme. Among the celebs on his team were John Cleese, Eddie Grant, Peter Blake and Christopher Reeve. More than million people turned into watch it, making it the fourth most watched show of the year. However, it wasnapost all bad news as they at least managed to raise £.m for their chosen charities.

But thereaposs one colour, youaposll rarely see the Queen wearing - and she once joked about the reason why. It appears that Her Majesty shuns wearing beige as it does nothing to help her stand out in a crowd - especially given her small stature. In his biography of the Queen, Robert Hardman says: My favourite remark she ever said was, aposI can ever wear beige because nobody will know who I am.’  And given the monarch has previously said she needs to be seen to be believed - it doesnapost seem she will be giving up bright colours any time soon.This was backed up by her daughter-in-law Sophie Wessex, who explained Her Majestyaposs colour palette in the documentary Our Queen at Ninety.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. She explained: Donapost forget that when she turns up somewhere, the crowds are two, three, four, ten,  deep, and someone wants to be able to say they saw a bit of the Queenaposs hat as she went past. She needs to stand out for people to be able to say aposI saw the Queenapos.  The Queen is currently still enjoying her Christmas break after spending the festive season at Windsor Castle.However,  will be a huge year for Her Majesty, who will celebrate  years on the throne.Celebrations for her Plantinum Jubilee will include the -year-old monarch opening her private estates to the public and some of the worldaposs biggest stars performing outside Buckingham Palace. It is not clear which events she will attend or take part in as she was ordered to rest by doctors in October last year following an overnight hospital stay for unspecied preliminary investigations.The bulk of the Jubilee duties are thought likely to be given to the rest of the Royal Family, including the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall. The Queen usually spends the anniversary of her accession privately at Sandringham.

She was pictured making the emotional pilgrimage from Windsor Castle to Sandringham in Norfolk on Sunday morning. She was driven part of the way and then took a helicopter.The couple lived apart in the final years of his le, with the Duke of Edinburgh based at Wood Farm while the Queen stayed at Buckingham Palace. She would regularly travel up to see him when she didnapost have engagements. The couple had only a small team of staff at the Farm, and they didnapost wear unorms as Philip didnapost like the formality. The five-bed cottage, which is tucked away on a quiet part of the estate overlooking the sea, is said to be were able to be a normal couple. The Queen is believed to have cooked and done the washing up during her stays there. Before Prince Philip moved in permanently, Wood Farm was regularly used by other members of the royal family. Kate Middleton stayed there during visits to the estate before she married Prince William. Itaposs also where Sarah Ferguson was made to stay after her orce from Prince Andrew. She wasnapost allowed to attend the Christmas celebrations in the aposBig Houseapos, but wanted to be nearby to see daughters Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. Prince Philip lived alone with assistance from staff at Wood Farm on Sandringham estate after transforming it into a private retreat. He was said to enjoy his time there, tucked away from the other royals, reading, painting watercolours and having friends to stay. A source told Mail Online: Everything is being put in order for the Queenaposs visit,apos one said. aposWeaposve been told that she will stay at Wood Farm, rather than the main house, which is nice as that always had a special place in his heart. The Queen normally marks the tragic anniversary of her fatheraposs death at Sandringham, remaining there after the royal familyaposs Christmas break.  However the spike in Covid cases meant she decided against the traditional family vacation in , and instead spend the holiday at Windsor. February  will mark  year since the King passed away, aged just . It will be the first time the Queen marks the anniversary without Philip by her side. It was the Duke who told his we, then Princess Elizabeth, the devastating news of her fathersapos death. They were on holiday in Kenya at the time. The evening before, the Queen had been taking pictures of the incredible wildle from their tree top hideaway, including baboons, elephants and even a warthog.  The couple got ready to depart for the next stage of their tour, which should have also taken them to New Zealand and Australia. Back in England, at Sandringham, the Kingaposs staff were preparing to wake him for the day. Despite his recent bout of ill health, he had been happy the previous day and had even been on a shoot with a friend. His final acts were to play with his two grandchildren, Charles and Anne, and have dinner with his youngest daughter, Princess Margaret. James McDonald, the Kingaposs valet, realised something was seriously wrong with the monarch when he ran him a bath and he didnapost wake as he usually did. A doctor was called to the palace who confirmed the sad news that King George had passed away in his sleep. But the coupleaposs secluded and isolated location meant it was almost impossible to break the terrible news to the princess that her father was dead. Journalist Granville Roberts, who was covering the royal tour, was the first person to receive the news in Kenya.He immediately told Prince Philipaposs private secretary, Commander Michael Parker, who tuned into the BBC to confirm the news.The Duke of Edinburgh had been taking an afternoon nap and was stunned when he was woken told the sad news. And Prince Philip now had to work out how he would tell his we the tragic news that the father she adored had died and she was now Queen. Rather than tell his we in a formal setting, surrounded by their staff, Philip took her for a walk in the grounds of the lodge they were staying in. It was a private moment for the couple while Elizabeth could be alone with her husband during her moment of grief. Ever aware of her public duty, Elizabeth immediately discussed the practicalities of herto England. But she also asked for an hour alone in her room. The Queenaposswas delayed for several hours due to a storm. Her staff also realised her mourning outfit had already been sent on by plane to the next stop on her royal tour.

And no one is feeling the cold - and the financial pinch - as much as pensioners. The Mirror is calling for VAT on energy bills to be scrapped as rocketing prices look set to push millions into poverty. The annual bill for an average three-bedroom gas-heated home could rise by an inflation-busting £ up to a huge £,, experts estimate. VAT of nearly % is included in what households pay for their gas and electricity. Scrapping it would save £ on the typical annual bill now, but could be worth £ a yeara price cap is hiked as expected in April. Here we reveal the harsh reality of rising energy costs faced by our elderly. Diane Skidmore,  Grandmother Diane Skidmore’s flat is so bitterly cold her grandchildren can’t even visit. The -year-old admits her home leaves all her visitors shivering and her family worried she’ll get pneumonia. But Diane says these are the s she has to go, to keep those rising energy bills down. The mum-of-six and gran to seven, has seen her energy bills soar by % in recent months from £ to £. Speaking from her frosty ground floor flat in Tulse Hill, South London, she said: “A neighbour came in yesterday and I noticed she was shivering. “I said ‘I’m really sorry. Let’s move into the living room’, where the temperature was not much dferent but the sun was shining in.”The former NHS worker gets £ to live on after her rent is paid from her state pension and is dreading the energy bill rises to come.“I live in the cold. My hands are freezing at the moment. Quite often my nose is cold like a dog’s. My kids are worried I will get pneumonia. “My daughters won’t bring the kids around because my house is so cold. They worry about me getting diseases or stuff too. “ Since the pandemic Diane only ventures out to get her prescriptions because she is asthmatic and has been shielding so does not spend any money on luxuries.  “I’m very worried the bills are going up because I can’t live any more frugally than I already live,” she explained. “I already don’t turn the heating on most days and I never ever turn the heating on at night. “On the very coldest days I put it on at pm and put the kitchen timer on for half an hour. There is a cold patch around about pm. “I’ve got a bath but I don’t do that a lot to be honest. I’m very low maintenance. “I mostly eat vegetables. I’ve got a gas kettle because electric kettles take up so much energy. “I’m just worried it’s going to be horrible. I have to have faith. I’m not the only one with trouble going on, they have to come up with a solution.” Diane says she has tried other ways to heat her flat by blocking all the air vents and putting a big thick heavy curtain up but said it just causes condensation and black mould. “But I refuse to moan about it because when I was young we didn’t have gas central heating, when it got cold you just put a jumper on or do some exercise,” she said. But then admits: “At night it is very cold in here. “At the moment it’s only one degree at night and I can feel my head and my nose are absolutely verging on damp. I have to go down the bed under the sheets to get warm. “My old neighbour, who died, had a ‘noddy’ hat which he kept on all through winter. He used to sleep in it too. “Maybe I should get a hat.” Jack Mortimer,   Jack Mortimer was part of the ‘greatest generation’ during World War II, helping secure freedom for the world when he was just  years old and “frightened to death”. Regardless of these heroics the D-Day veteran, like many pensioners across the UK, is now living in fear of his energy bills. The -year-old only boils enough water for one cuppa and puts his immersion heating on every other day, to keep his rising energy bills down. At night the main light is switched off as he manages with his single bulb reading lamp only. And the energy “monitor thingy” he’s been given, sits ominously in the corner, constantly catching his eye. Jack has never been one to complain but says: “I don’t know how they can justy the increase. It doesn’t seem to be right but whatever Ofgem can do about it I don’t know. “I have always been economical with electricity. I only boil the amount of water you need for a cup of tea. Every other night I turn off the hot water system. “I have storage heaters and they are quite efficient and it’s cheap electric. “I am concerned the bills are going up because my income only goes up when the Government gives me a pension rise and as soon as they do that they take it off you in some other way. “Nobody seems to be worried about us. It’s like once you get over  they don’t want to know.” He lives alone in his third-floor flat in Leeds as his -year-old we Flo, who has dementia, went into a home last year. He visits her every day from  to pm. And while the couple are due to celebrate their th wedding anniversary next week, sadly they will not be together as they have both tested positive for Covid. His flat is all electric and he complained last year because he seemed to be paying more than his neighbours and a month ago was fitted with a smart meter. “They said I was paying more because I was not paying enough before and owed them nearly £. So I’m paying them in instalments now. These meters don’t seem to be as efficient as they should be,” he said. “I’ve had my meter changed now and yet to receive a new bill so I don’t know what dference that might make.”  He said out of his £ a week pension, he pays a £ monthly direct debit for his electric and pays a monthly rent of £. “I’m keeping my head above water but it is worrying,” he finally admits as he goes through his outgoings. “They have given me a monitor thingy to show how much I’m using. There’s an arc on it and it goes green when I’m doing all right but it goes in the red when I put the oven on. “When I’m sat at night, I don’t put the main bulb on which has three bulbs in it but just put the single light on, it’s not dangerous and is just enough light. “I only use the electric when I have to use it, when it gets dark I put a light on.” Jack was a despatch driver, behind the wheel of a jeep carrying ammunition and mortars on D-Day. He served with th Ordnance Beach Detachment. He landed on Sword Beach, as shells and mortars flew overhead, before advancing on to Caen. He said: “D-Day was a colossal project, you can’t imagine going over the Channel and being so close that you could almost step onto the next boat, there were thousands of them. “It was dangerous, there were snipers around. It was noisy and smoky when we landed, and I remember seeing lots of casualties.  “I was  years old and frightened to death, everyone was, the army doesn’t tell you a lot, it gives you orders and you follow them, you don’t get an explanation. “...I was told to come off the beach and turn right, and there was a great big field which I helped to de-mine, then we dug a foxhole... and when you hear a plane approaching you jump straight into the foxhole. “I wouldn’t be here but for the paras who landed near Ranville - there were some big guns there and the paras took them out, otherwise Sword Beach could’ve been shelled out of existence. “ He got married to Flo after ing on leave in  and after the army became a General Manager of a clothing company in Halax making ladies’ blouses. He said previously: “I’m grateful that I’m alive, I’m grateful that I survived and I’m sorry that so many had to die, those were the heroes. “I don’t think I’m a hero, the heroes are the ones who didn’t come home, and they should always be remembered. It is very emotional, of course, to remember those who went and didn’t come back.” Pensioners queueing up for cafes to stay warm  Elderly people have been heading to a shopping centre in Leeds to keep warm and keep their heating bills down at home. At Denicos Italian cafe in Crossgates shopping centre in Leeds staff say some pensioners have been queuing up to come in from the cold - even before they open at .am. Waitress Leah Whitehouse said: “They come as soon as we open at .am. Every single morning. There are two people who sit for three hours and then come again in the afternoon.” Her colleague Tracy Smith, , adds: “They come to keep warm. It is sad and there are definitely more now.” One of their regulars Elizabeth Kumiskey,  and her -year-old husband, Peter, are in their favourite ‘warm spot’ in the middle of the cafe. They point out it’s much colder on the tables nearer the entrance. Former NHS nurse, Peter, explains how their gas was cut off before Christmas because there was a leak and their boiler was condemned. He said they can’t afford to get it fixed as it would take a massive “chunk” out of their savings which they were going to use for a walk-in shower to make it easier for them. “We got several quotes for the central heating and it was about £,. Even with grants offered. “We have savings but I want to keep those for Elizabeth. She is not on a full pension because she brought up five children. It’s an insult what they get! “If I go first I want to leave something for her.” Putting a brave face on their predicament, he adds: “We’ve got a couple of electric fans now so it’s a bit better and we put the snake draft excluder down. We don’t have enough hot water for a bath.  “We save money by buying food here. It’s cheaper than buying groceries and putting the oven on and it’s nice.” Elizabeth, clutching her mug of coffee for warmth and wearing a woolly bobble hat, added: “I keep warm when Peter holds my hand.” And about the sacrices they have made to pay their bills, she adds: “You just expect less. We are quite frugal. We would like to go on holiday for a few days, somewhere with a bath maybe.” At a nearby Age UK meeting Margaret Logan, , a former supermarket worker, says she also watches the energy she uses carefully as she pays around £ a quarter. She said: “I don’t have the heating on high just to warm the room a bit. I try not to cook as much with the electric cooker and use my microwave instead. “I like to go out a couple of times a week for a coffee but when the prices go up I might have to stop that.” She adds: “But I’m not too bad. I’m lucky. “The other day I went round to see my friend and she was sat in her big thick coat to keep warm. It was so cold in her house. She had no money because she had bought Christmas presents for her family members”. Jacqueline Lawson, the Leeds coordinator for Age UK, said some pensioners have been putting newspapers to block the drafts in their windows. She added: “I know people who have not been out for two years because of the pandemic so their house is a sanctuary for them. But when they are frightened of putting the heating on - that sanctuary ends up a cold and hostile place. It becomes a cold fridge.” Coldest town in England  It’s the coldest place ever recorded in England. In January , temperatures in Newport, Shropshire, plunged to -. degrees. So where better to talk to people about the impending energy crisis  We bump into Philip and Pat Briscoe, who have been married for  years, on the market town’s main thoroughfare. “We were with Avro,” explained Pat, , speaking of one of the energy firms which collapsed last year, with Ofgem appointing Octopus Energy to take over. “That was last September, so we’ve gone over to Octopus but we don’t know what our rate’s going to be yet. They’ve got too many to deal with so they keep sending us emails telling us we will be able to look at our account soon. “We are concerned but we’re fortunate that we can afford to pay,” added the former receptionist. “If it doubles we will cut down a bit.” “We have to becauseyou pay more for your heating you’re going to be paying more for your food as well,” said Philip, . “Everything’s going up at the moment.” Brian and Celia Styles feel for people who are struggling.  “You’re bound to get a higher bill anyway because it’s the winter,” said Celia, . “And until it comes you just don’t know how much. Financially we’re not that bad but a lot of people will struggle. The cost of living and everything’s going up. A lot of people,they’ve lost their jobs, where are they going to get the money from ” “It’s going to go up whatever happens,” added Brian, an -year-old retired industrial engineer. “I just put the heating onI need it but not everyone can do that.” Many older people suggested young people were suffering the most. “I think my monthly bills will go up by %,” said Judy, , a former PA in education. “My electricity is with E.ON and they’ve told me it needs to go up, I’m still waiting on the gas. “You either use the gas or you’re cold which I’m not prepared to be. “The problem is everything has gone up, including food,” she added. “I feel for people who can’t afford the increase - clothing, heating, food, everything’s going up. A lot of people are in poverty now. It’s an awful situation where you have heat or eat. “I feel most sorry for the families just above the limit where they can get help.” “I’m glad I’m at the end and not the beginning,” said Judy as she headed off to finish her shopping. “I feel for my grandchildren.

Mr Johnson previously said: Todayaposs latest ONS data shows infection levels are falling in England and while there are some places where cases are likely to continue rising, including in primary schools, our scientists believe it is likely that the Omicron wave has peaked nationally.

And February looks set to be a turbulent mix of wet and windy conditions with more freezing and snowy conditions creeping in at times. Mr Hammond added: There are signs of a more lively start to February - it looks wetter and windier at times than for much of the previous month.We may see colder weather start to make more definite inroads from the north through the early days of the new month, turning some of that rain to snow.Maps for WXCharts show that temperatures are set to drop to sub zero around January  and the first week of February is expected to see heavy snow fall. On February  the mercury could fall to as low as -C in Scotland while there could be up to cm of snow in the far north west of the UK. In England there could be up to eight centimetres falling in Manchester.  Given these expected weather conditions, the UK Health Security Agency has urged people to check neighbours are safe, especially in parts of England which will experience their coldest temperatures of the winter so far. Agostinho Sousa, a consultant at the agency, said: Cold weather can have a serious impact on health, particularly for older people and those with heart and lung problems, as it increases the risks of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections.  Remind vulnerable relatives and neighbours to heat their home to at least C - particularlythey have reduced mobility, are  or older, or have a health condition. Should they need to go outside, itaposs important for them to wear shoes with a good grip. The Met Office has forecast snow in the UK for the beginning of February, saying: High pressure is expected to be near or across the UK to start with, before gradually declining southwards further into February.  This means that, especially at first, the generally settled conditions will prevail with bright or sunny spells. There is still the increased likelihood of frost and fog, the fog lingering all day in places. Later in February, it is likely to turn more changeable in the north, with outbreaks of rain and stronger winds. There is an increased chance of these pushing further south at times, though settled conditions are most likely to persist here.  Temperatures are expected to be slightly above average overall, particularly in the north. Some colder interludes are still likely though, bringing a risk of occasional snow, most likely over northern hills. However for today, Sunday January , Met Office forecaster, Alex Deakin said there will be breaks in the cloud so some sunshine is possible for some parts. He added: Temperatures will get up to C or C a little higherwe do see any spells of sunshine coming through.

Later on Monday in the south it will remain cold but with the possible promise of brighter intervals, with similar conditions in the north, Scotland and Northern Ireland. For Tuesday and Wednesday there will be occasional rain in the northwest which will move south on Thursday, bringing potentially heavy showers. A spokesman for the Met Office said: “It will turn very briefly colder on Thursday and as conditions move south it will bring showers with it.  “Across England and Wales it will remain largely dry for the week, there will be more in the western areas of Scotland.” Brits worried about the possibility of the arrival of snow can relax however as it is not expected this week. He added: “There could be some in the highest ground of Scotland on some of the mountains. “Nothing  wintry is expected at all.” It comes as  was officially named the joint sixth warmest year since records began  years ago.  The Met Office warned global warming and other long-term climate change trends are expected to continue as a result of record levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Dr Colin Morice, of the Met Office, said: “ is one of the warmest years on record, continuing a series of measurements of a world that is warming under the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. This extends a streak of notably warm years from  to  - the warmest seven years in over  years of measurements.” Prof Tim Osborn, of the University of East Anglia, added: “Each year tends to be a little below or a little above the underlying long-term global warming. “Global temperature data analysed by the Met Office and UEAaposs Climatic Research Unit show  was a little below, while  had been a little above, the underlying warming trend. “All years, including , are consistent with long-standing predictions of warming due to human activities.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Met OfficeUniversity of East AngliaSnowClimate changeWeather\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates from our environment editor on green issues and actions you can takeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She has a lot of separation anxiety.  The little girl lost seven pounds through the harrowing ordeal and has been left severely traumatised. Laboyaposs lawyer, Seth Harris, says Lyric has been slapping her dad while heaposs sleeping to make sure heaposs alive. The homelessness department has denied the youngster was left alone for five days, but did not provide details on how long she was left. They told the New York Post the incident is under investigation and has already sparked changes in the way they work. The shelter now conducts same-night wellness checks for residents who fail to sign the evening register, they say. Shelbi - who was separated from dad Quraan - had moved into an apartment-like unit at the homeless shelter around three or four months before her death, according to documents filed at Manhattanaposs Supreme Court. It wasnapost until a resident in a neighbouring unit smelled a foul odour coming from Shelbiaposs room that the alarm was raised, legal papers say. Another lawyer for Laboy, Allison Keenan, claims the mumaposs last sign-in date at the shelter was six days before her body was discovered. Harris told the New York Post: “It’s amazing that she’s alive. Keenan said: “Allowing an infant to remain with her dead mother for five days unnoticed not only highlights the indference and lack of humanity shown to those most in need but exhibits complete malfeasance by the City of New York and Department of Homeless Services.  Lyric is now in a far better physical condition after regaining all the weight she initially lost. But Quraan says she still cries out for her mum nearly every night. “She always wakes up in the middle of the night, she’s kicking, she’s fighting, saying, ‘Mommy,’ I look at her and I just start tearing up sometimes,” he said. Quraan has left his job to take care of his daughter - who is his number one priority now.

Content creator Danny Kim challenged chef Ashish Alfred to give the fast food meal a complete overhaul. Handing him a Filet-O-Fish burger with a side of fries and an apple pie, Danny dared the chef to turn the dish into something more appetising. The -year-old chef from Maryland, US managed to create two gourmet dishes in an hour, producing a feast of quenelled fish mousse with delicate tuile wafers, and an apple souffle. Ashish starts by chopping up the fries, putting them in a saucepan and adding thyme, heavy cream, butter, salt, white pepper and some water. He then sets the pan aside, turning his attention to the fish burger. He removes the bun and scrapes the breading off the fish, before chopping it into smaller chunks. Placing the fish in a separate bowl, he adds egg white, scallops, more fish and salt, before putting the mixture in a robot coupe and adding heavy cream and butter. He removes lumps from the pureed mixture and reveals he has created a fish mousse. Meanwhile, he puts the buns in a blender alongside an egg, salt, heavy cream and water, and blends the mixture. He then uses a silicone mould to spread the mixture and puts it in the oven – where they will harden to become tuile wafers. Meanwhile, the fries mixture is cooked on the hob before being added to a blender to create a potato puree. Ashish adds more cream to the puree as well as a pinch of salt and whisks it together. He adds the liquied mixture into a spoon gun and sets to boil. The chef next turns to the apple pie, slicing it open and scooping out the apples. He mashes the fruit and warms it up in a saucepan alongside some cream. In a separate bowl, he mixes together two eggs, sugar, flour and water, before straining the mixture. He then heats it up and adds the apples. While the mixture cools, he whisks egg whites to add the rest of the pie mixture to, putting them in ramekins in the oven to bake. Meanwhile, Ashish adds fish stock to a frying pan to reduce. In another bowl, he heats up water with lemon juice before adding the fish mousse in large blobs to become quenelles. In a frying pan, he adds butter, a splash of heavy cream, parsley, caviar and chopped hazelnuts to cook for the cream sauce. Finally, he plates up the extravagant food – plating the quenelles with the cream sauce and topping it with the leaf-shaped tuile wafers. He takes the ramekins out of the oven and the apple pie mixture has risen beautully to create the perfect souffle, which he dusts with icing sugar. The finished result is two restaurant-worthy gourmet dishes: fish quenelles with tuile, and apple souffle. Danny and Ashish test out the food, sampling bites of each dish. Biting into one of the the quenelles of fish mousse, Danny says: “Dude you killed it – that’s fine dining right there.” Of the souffle, Danny nods his approval and says: “That’s pretty good.” The post racked up more than seven million likes on TikTok and was viewed  million times.

Homicide detectives in Atlanta, Georgia, say the shot was fired up to ft away to where Dr Matthew Willson was hit in the head. The bullet had travelled through the exterior wall of a block of flats before striking the Brit, , as he was in bed with his girlfriend, Katherine Shepard. The -year-old American has told how she cradled him in her arms as he died. Ms Shepard, who had dated Dr Willson, from Chertsey, Surrey, for three years, said: “He was supposed to be here for three months because we’ve been long distance for a while. “I picked him up from the airport, took him to his favourite eating location – and the next day he’s gone.”  She said she remains “in disbelief” over the tragedy. Recalling the harrowing moment last week she added: “I turned to Matthew and said, ‘I’m going to call the cops.’ “His last words were, ‘Sure, I’m sure they are just messing around.’  “I was kneeling on my bed looking out of the window to seeI could see anything. I felt the bed move, Matt was possibly getting up, and there was a tiny explosion in our room. “Then I heard Matt’s breathing change and I askedhe was OK.” Ms Shepard said she turned on the light, adding: “He had started to slump over. I saw he’d been shot in the head and started screaming. “I knelt on the bed holding a towel to his head and talking to him and shaking him whenever he started closing his eyes. He looked like he was looking at me, but he wasn’t talking at all and he was struggling to breathe. “I just felt panic. While we were waiting for the ambulance there were more gunshots fired.” Her flatmate, Aman Kar, called  immediately, but by the time an ambulance arrived  minutes later Dr Willson was unresponsive.  He was pronounced dead in a local hospital a short time later. An Atlanta police spokesman said: “We do not believe this is gang-related. We believe this is a random act of iniduals discharging firearms recklessly. No arrests have been made. The area is considered a generally safe area. We don’t typically deal with a whole lot of gun violence.” The Foreign Office said it was “supporting the family of a British man following his death”.

We usually do a dozen of eggs and they eat some pancake sausages - thataposs what the younger kids eat because theyaposre picky, she said. Believe it or not, I only go to the grocery store once a week, and we usually spend about  a week.  My biggest challenge is managing all the extra laundry and the housework.

Literally, itaposs never a dull moment, and everywhere we go, we get great behaviour compliments. Theyaposre great children. I do believe them having that family togetherness helps a lot.  Iaposm great with the idea of  to  kids, she added, although she admits she doesnapost actually like being pregnant. Yalancia added: I get severely sick. I puke non-stop all day long. It doesnapost stop. aposIt lasts the whole nine months until you actually push the baby out. If Michael could carry babies, I would surely let him finish off carrying the rest. They have another child on the way and after eight boys, they hoped this time things would be dferent. But during a gender reveal that was documented on the Truly series, they confirmed another little lad was due later this year. If I was going to Las Vegas, Iaposll be betting on blue for sure, she joked.

Only changing your bed sheets once a week  WRONG.But the latest tip comes from a very creditable source, and even the Queen trusts him. Chef Jeff Baker says a lot of people make a common mistake when cooking the meat, which is why it ends up being very greasy. And heaposs previously cooked for the Queen - so he clearly knows what heaposs talking about when it comes to the kitchen.Speaking to Daily Star, he says itaposs all to do with getting the pan nice and hot, rather than cooking the meat slow and steady. By doing it this way, the bacon should caramelise, making it crispier and giving the meat a punchier flavour.He explained: I find that the best way to cook bacon is on a medium to high heat pan with a small amount of natural fat, searing it on each side for a minute or so.If the bacon is properly dry-cured and cut to a nice thickness, it should caramelise on the edges.  The fat will then render without dissolving, resulting in delicious flavour.The chef, who works with online butchery retailer Farmison  Co also shared another top tip - but itaposs pretty controversial.He continued to say that he doesnapost think you should add any condiments to your bacon, so wave goodbye to ketchup or brown sauce.Do you have a food or cooking hack to share  We want to hear all about it. Email us at yourmirror@mirror In my opinion,cooked this way the bacon won’t need any sauce to enhance the taste - it’ll be perfect as it is, he said. The chef also claimed weaposve been making similar mistakes when cooking curry as well. Apparently, we should be heating the spices in oil before cooking to intensy the flavours. To ‘temper’ your spices means to heat them up in oil to bring out their flavours, he explained. It’s a simple, quick step that reaps rewards when it comes to enhancing your dish and intensying the flavours from the spices. Once you start doing this, you’ll really notice the dference, and it’ll just become part of the curry cooking process.

Folded egg come pre-cooked, theyaposre not this yellow in real le, I donapost know why theyaposre this yellow in my camera, he said, in a clip posted to the @essentialsmcdonaldsTikTok account, the Daily Star reports.All we do we just throw them on the grill and we just arrange them neatly, put a little water in there and then cook them. They come up, we just scoop them into a tray and thataposs it for the folded egg. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. He added: These are the round eggs, so theyaposre cooked fresh every day, aka cracked fresh. I did forget to butter the grill surface here so theyaposre going to stick a little bit and then we pop all the yolks. Pour some water in the top so that steams the yolks and the egg. We pull them out of the ring moulds and scoop them up with the same egg tool and thataposs it. Many fast food fans said they will now only order round eggs after realising that itaposs made from scratch, but rhe worker pointed out that the folded eggs are usually used in the McGriddle. One said: Of course Iaposm the type thataposs been preferring the not-fresh egg type all these years. Always substitute for round eggs at McDonaldaposs, another wrote. The folded eggs have the weirdest texture to me. In the UK the folded egg comes in a carton that they cook fresh daily, a fellow worker confirmed, while another added: Well, in Poland both types are made of fresh eggs.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

But, most of us will remember the sheer volume of homework we were set at school, which teachers would then have to take home and mark in their spare time - or so we thought, anyway.One teacher has left people gobsmacked after revealing her very own way of storing all the homework she sets for her students, and we genuinely didnapost see this coming.

For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. I know something you donapost, I know something youaposll never know, she mouthed in the clip, before it cut to her throwing a big old pile of homework in the bin. Yep, the bin. On the clip, she wrote: Teachers that get it, get it. Teachers that donapost, donapost. All that hard work just chucked in the bin. Itaposs a long time since weaposve been set any homework, weaposve got to admit, it still stings a little. We call that aposfiling it awayapos, one teacher commented, while another added: aposThis is going to be gradedapos - trashes it a week later. A third teacher wrote: I use to bring it home to throw it out because I had some irrational fear of the work being found in my classroom garbage and getting in trouble.

Paul Lang, , took up the job in July  as lockdown meant he couldnapost make films.He describes it as a privilege and says itaposs made him appreciate the people who do jobs we all take for granted.Paul has seen some weird and wonderful things in the last  months, including a man in his s wearing a baffling outfit. And heaposs also discovered the four-word phrase that all delivery drivers absolutely hate. Heaposs turned his experiences into a book, From Hollywood to Cricklewood: Delivering during a Pandemic. You have a unique window into someone’s le - it’s humbling, funny, sad, frustrating and a real privilege, he told The Sun.One time a man in his eighties answered the door wearing rubber gloves, a face mask, a transparent apron and old flip flops held onto his feet by parcel tape – and nothing . I didn’t quite know where to look. But for Paul, the worst part of the job is checking a customeraposs delivery details and seeing a certain phrase. He said: When you find it’s up four floors with no lt and you have  trays of food your heart sinks - I do dread the words, “th Floor, No Lt. The same thing happens with water - gallons of it. Opening the van and seeing I have lots of trays of water does make your head drop as it’s so heavy.

And his biggest request to future customers  Make sure you put your house number on your front door, as many people donapost so heaposs forced to check the bins.Other Tesco staff have also shared some of the secrets of working at the store, and the things that really bug them.But the main thing that gets on their nerves is when people are rude at the self-service tills, claiming that however annoyed the customer is - itaposs nothing compared to how annoyed staff are. I hate them more than you do. And impatiently waving your product in front of the scanner isnapost going to make my le any easier. I hold the power to unlock these bad boys, and the red light flashing above you has already told me you need my help. And staff with that customers wouldnapost hover around them when they reduce prices, adding: Those yellow stickers are coming out, and its like shoppers can smell them a mile off.

People store anything and everything in their lofts, from suitcases, to old photo albums to Christmas decorations, but have we ever stopped to think about what we should be putting up there, and more importantly, what we shouldnapost It turns out there are several common items that are regularly stored in peopleaposs lofts which could be doing more harm than good. The Liverpool Echo spoke to Joyce French, cleaning expert at HomeHow, who outlines the seven things you should never store in the loft. Electronics Got an old cassette player or Gameboy gathering dust in the attic  Everyone has outdated electronics that they just can’t let go of. However, old electronics can still overheat in the loft. The circuitry can blow and ruin your item forever - so it’s best to keep beloved electronics in a cooler environment downstairs, take them to a recycling centre, or sell them online. Holiday decorations As our Christmas decorations come down and the New Year begins, it is time to store away your holiday décor. But next yearaposs festive season could be a lot less merryyou keep the decorations in the loft. Delicate fabrics, items that are painted, and special plastic ornaments may warp in the heat and are prone to damage in a humid environment, like the attic. Instead, store holiday decorations in a large plastic container box in a cool environment, such as the garage.  Wooden furniture Maybe youaposve inherited antique wooden furniture and itaposs not quite your style, but you donapost want to throw it away. It may be tempting to store it in the loft, but you shouldnapost - as wood can warp in the damp, crack in the heat, and grow mould in humid conditions. Wood also tends to attract woodworm, which can eat away at wood furniture. Paint After doing up the house, you may have leftover paint, but oil-based paints can heat up to hazardous, combustible levelsstored in a hot roofspace. They are highly flammable, so should be kept in a temperature-controlled spot, like a spare cabinet. The dramatic temperature fluctuations can break down latex paint too, making it unusable.  Important documents Many of us keep important documents, such as birth certicates and passports, together in one place. But the loft is one of the worst places to keep these, as they donapost hold up well with temperature fluctuations. Your important documents will begin to fade, get damp, dusty or stick together as time goes on. Invest in a storage drawer unit for documents you need and bring them downstairs. Cardboard boxes If you’re storing things in cardboard boxes in your attic, it may be time to reconsider. Pests like mice and bugs are attracted to cardboard and glue, feeding off it and making it their home for breeding. Cardboard boxes also tend to become damp and disintegrate over time, potentially damaging the precious items inside. Food and wine Some lofts can reach temps high enough in the summer to cook canned goods, so foods that are safe enough to store away for a long time shouldn’t be kept here. As well as this, unsuitable warm temperatures can spoil expensive wines. Pests such as mice and rats thrive in a humid attic environment, and can also contaminate and chew through food items. Instead, store perishables and wine in a cool, dry place so they are safe for consumption after a long term.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Or a Friday. Or a Monday. Who are we kidding, whenever. But the one thing that can completely ruin that delicious fast food treat is running out of your favourite condiment. Twitter user Hannah Louise wasnapost taking any chances when she ordered dinner from a local restaurant, and added a ml portion of garlic sauce to her tab.She admits she wasnapost quite sure how staff would deliver such a large quality of liquid, but we would have assumed it would arrive in some sort of bottle or drinks container. But no. What actually arrived left Hannah stunned, and her hilarious post has since gone viral on social media. She tweeted: Ordered a ml portion of garlic sauce with our takeaway and I dunno what I was expecting but it wasnapost this.  She later added that the sauce was delicious. Her message made fellow users chuckle, and people were equally surprised. One joked: Looks like somebody’s first day working at the takeaway is going really well! Another added: This restaurant deserves  stars for fulfilling this ridiculous request. Others were just jealous of the quantity. A user replied: It hurts to see others living my dream. Another said: That is the correct amount of garlic sauce. Even the restaurant chain Harvester got involved, replying to her message to plug their own delivery service. They said: We favour bottles , personally. Always here with appropriate kickinapos garlic sauce portions on your favourite delivery apps. Her message has promoted others to share their funny delivery tales. One wrote: Donapost know why this reminds me of the time my we ordered some sort of chocolate brownie pudding and the pub kitchen mixed up the white chocolate sauce with the caesar dressing. She ate half of it before she realised. Another added: At a Chinese all you can eat buffet, my mum once took what she thought was a banana fritter and smothered it in golden syrup, only to find it was battered chicken! A third commented: We went to an All You Can Eat Buffet when my children were little. They had sweetcorn jelly for dessert. They’re in their s now and still talk about it.

In a highly unusual move, the Foreign Office levelled the accusation at Putin as he considers whether to mount an invasion against Russiaaposs neighbour.It took the unusual step of naming former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Murayev as a potential Kremlin candidate to take over the Ukrainian government in Kyiv in a Russian pupper regime. British officials also named four former Ukrainian ministers suspected of colluding with Russian intelligence officers on a plan to attack Ukraine.What do you make of the Foreign Officeaposs move  Have your say in the comment sectionThe move comes as Western allies stepped up warnings that Russia will pay a heavy pricethe estimated , troops massed on the border launch any kind of incursion into Ukraine. And UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned his fellow European Union leaders against naivetyover Putin’s Ukraine demands, as reported by the .In a statement, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the Russian plotting showed the s to which the Kremlin was prepared go to undermine the government in Kyiv.  The information being released today shines a light on the extent of Russian activity designed to subvert Ukraine, and is an insight into Kremlin thinking, she said. Russia must de-escalate, end its campaigns of aggression and disinformation, and pursue a path of diplomacy. As the UK and our partners have said repeatedly, any Russian military incursion into Ukraine would be a massive strategic mistake with severe costs.  Mr Murayev, a media owner, lost his seat in the Ukrainian parliament when his party failed to secure % of the vote in elections in . He has reportedly spoken out in the past in support of Russiaaposs annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in . In addition, the Foreign Office named four other Ukrainian politicians who, it said, maintained links with the Russian intelligence services.  It said some of them had been in contact with Russian intelligence officers working on the invasion plan. They include Mykola Azarov who served as prime minister under the pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych who was toppled in a popular uprising in . Mr Azarov fled to Russia where he established what was widely seen as a puppet government-in-exile. He has been the subject of international sanctions and an Interpol red notice issued at the request of the Ukrainian government.  Also in the list is Vladimir Sivkovich, the former deputy head of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, who was this week made the subject of US sanctions for allegedly working with Russian intelligence. The others are Serhiy Arbuzov and Andriy Kluyev who both served as deputy prime minister under Mr Yanukovych. Bois Johnson is said to consider the crisis as gravely dangerous and warned his European counterparts against naivety over the demanded conditions Putin has set on any Russian de-escalation of the situation, which include a ban on Ukraine joining Nato.  Germanyaposs navy chief stepped down on Saturday after drawing criticism for saying Putin deserved respect and that Kyiv would never win back annexed Crimea from Moscow. Vice Admiral Kay-Achim Schoenbach said Putin seeks to be treated as an equal by the West. What hereally wants is respect, Schoenbach said. And my God, giving someone respect is low cost, even no cost... It is easy to give him the respect he really demands - and probably also deserves. Schoenbach added that the Crimea peninsula is gone, it will never come back, this is a fact, contradicting the joint Western position that Moscowaposs annexation of the peninsula from Ukraine in  cannot be accepted and must be reversed.A Downing Street source told the: “The Prime Minister’s view is that the situation in Ukraine is the biggest test to the unity and resolve of the West and the Nato alliance in decades. “It would be frankly naive to assume that Russia could be mollied by changes to the European security architecture – the Kremlin’s behaviour has made that consistently clear. “The UK is working through Nato and in lockstep with the US to enact a policy of dialogue and deterrence, pursuing the diplomatic track but readying a package of sanctions that will pierce the heart of Russia’s economy should that fail. Britain has sent troops and defence weapons to Ukraine and on Saturday it was reported Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu has accepted an invite to London to meet Defence Secretary Ben Wallace.A senior defence source said: The Defence Secretary is glad that Russia has accepted the invitation to talk with his counterpart. Given the last defence bilateral between our two countries took place in London in , Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu has offered to meet in Moscow instead.  The Secretary of State has been clear that he will explore all avenues to achieve stability and a resolution to the Ukraine crisis. We are in communication with the Russian government. More than , Russian troops, as well as equipment including tanks, were moved to the Ukrainian border this week.This week President Joe Biden warned he believes an attack is ‘imminent’, although he was criticised for hinting any response would depend on the severity.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Foreign OfficeMykola AzarovSergei ShoiguLiz TrussBen WallaceJoe BidenViktor YanukovychVladimir PutinPoliticsUkraine crisisRussia\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Daniela Pacittoaposs transformation was not about a fad diet, she claims - more about portion control. She shared her impressive story with Express and said little tricks helped her lose all the weight.Daniela was inspired by the fear of failing to squeeze into a le jacked. There was another big worry she had - fitting into chairs when in bars and restaurants. She said she became ashamed and stopped going to social meet-ups with her pals and she quickly became isolated. I couldnapost believe the size I was, Daniela said. Something as simple as tying my shoes would have me out of breath. Walking outside in the heat was uncomfortable. Fitting into chairs, being over the weight limit for things that I wanted to do. I started isolating myself from social gatherings that involved physical activities that I knew I wouldnapost be able to do. My friends would always go on trips white water rafting and I wouldn’t go out of the fear that the le jackets wouldn’t fit or my weight would make an uneven distribution on the boat.  My eyes were opened the day I saw pictures of myself from a trip. It was about how much food she had on her plate - not the bad things she was eating. Daniella loved to cook healthy food but said going back for more was often her downfall. She says she has never completely cut anything out but moved to stop keeping trigger foods in her home. She explained she didn’t follow any diet plan but slowly changed her habits over time. Daniella added: I always loved cooking and enjoyed all food, healthy and not. I struggled a lot with portioning. I ate a lot of healthy food but massive amounts and I also ate a lot of unhealthy food as well. One thing that really helped me is using smaller plates and bowls. I am someone that will always clear my plate so I would start with a smaller one and once I was finished I would give it some time to digest, she explained.  Most of the time I would be satisfied with just that portion but sometimes I would want more and I would listen to my body and let myself have that second portion. She went on: I would finish an entire bag a couple of times a week. Chips are still a food that I don’t have much control over, I will always finish the bagI know it’s there so I don’t keep them in the apartment regularly. If I want some every here and there I will get some though. It’s just no longer a nightly snack.

It’s dficult being a young manager and I explained to him that he has to use the experience he picked up as a player and take things from managers that he played under.

The conclusion we’ve come it is that we are not going to get to the bottom of this till we talk to the people themselves, the kids who are getting involved in this and that’s where we are putting our effort at the moment.“We have secured the assistance of the local high school who are going to work with us on this, maybe through focus groups and with a little bit of talk perhaps we can find a solution.”Sergeant David Rourke said: “I don’t have all the answers and I’ll not pretend that I do. I wish I did, but I certainly believe what we need to do is engage the children and youths of the communities a lot better.“So what we’ve been trying to do is work in partnership with the high schools, the community council in Peebles and ious other organisations such as Youth Action Teams to address and ert the youth’s attentions from vandalisms such as what has happened in the play park to more productive activities around the region.“Generally when we have vandalism or any sort of crime we have feedback such as ‘where were the police’ or ‘what are the police doing to resolve this ’“The police cannot resolve this on their own. Resourcing levels as we know across the board in the UK as a whole means we cant have police officers on every street corner every minute of the day to prevent crime happening so what we need to do is work as communities to spot it happening in the first place.”.removeA number of groups in the area have also stepped up to help.Lori Lee from the Community Sports Hub said: “We’ve been working hard to try and get sport back up on the table and that’s something during COVID we have been unable to do. So the opportunity hasn’t been there for young people to get out and be active in sport and potentially this is a reason behind anti-social behaviour.”And Dave Hodson from Tweeddale Youth Action added: “Through our youth clubs in Peebles and Innerleithen we continue to offer activities and opportunities for young people to have fun. We offer a place where young people can access support, advice and where we can signpost further services.“And really through volunteering opportunities we try and foster a sense of community spirit within our young people.“It’s important to say as well that the vast majority of our young people do play an active role in community le and are fantastic.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-men-admit-jedburgh-high-street-clothing-shop-raid","story":"BACKGROUND reports have been ordered into two Borders men following a raid on a Borders clothing store.Thirty-year-old Andrew Clamp, of Hawick, pleaded guilty to a charge of theft by housebreaking at the premises of David Thomson  Son outfitters in High Street, Jedburgh, on November , .He also admitted the theft of a vehicle.Co-accused Scott Shearman, , pleaded guilty to the reset of shirts, jumpers, coats and jeans stolen from the shop which were found at his home in Howdenbank, Hawick, on November .He also admitted obstructing police and instructing his dog to attack a police officer.:Anti-vaccine group hack Scottish Borders Councils Twitter accountJedburgh Sherf Court was told that the dog bit Shearman on his arm instead.The court also heard that £, worth of clothing was stolen in the Jedburgh shop raid with £ worth of clothing recovered.Sentence was deferred until February  for the production of a Criminal Justice Social Work Report.Clamp also admitted assaulting two men with a metal pole on August  last year in Wellfield Road, Hawick.

inflation took hold and will now have to “move faster” with further rises, the Bank’s former deputy governor has warned.Sir Charlie Bean, who was deputy governor for monetary policy throughout the financial crisis and a recently-retired member of the UK’s fiscal watchdog, criticised the Bank’s decision to hold off from raising rates until December.He told the PA news agency that policymakers should have acted in November, or earlier, as the economy showed signs of overheating.But Sir Charlie, who retired from the Office for Budget Responsibilityat the end of last year, said the Bank was powerless to influence energy prices and that the Government needs to step in and help ease the cost of living squeeze.The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committeeincreased the cost of borrowing from .% to .% last month, the first hike for more than three years, as it warned that inflation was set to reach % in the spring.It came after the Bank caught financial markets off guard when it kept rates unchanged in November, despite having laid the foundation for a rise.Sir Charlie said the Bank’s rates stance “has erred too much towards looseness through the course of the past few months”, adding that he was “surprised” by the decision to hold off in November.“If I was on the MPC, I would have been in favour of moving a little bit earlier than they have done,” he said.He said a strong economic bounce-back and resilient jobs market despite the end of the furlough scheme would have supported a rate rise before December, potentially even months earlier.While he said it was not a “signicant policy error” made by the Bank, it would likely mean rate-setters have to “move faster” with further increases as inflation has already soared to its highest level for nearly  years.Official figures earlier this week showed inflation jumped to .% in December, far higher than the Bank expected..removeExperts now predict another rate hike to .% at the Bank’s next meeting in early February, which would mark first time the MPC has made back-to-back increases since June .At least another rise is also expected by the end of the year.vw,vw,px, px\"Sir Charlie Bean warned Omicron may wipe up to % off growth Sir Charlie, also a professor at the London School of Economics, warned the Bank’s action would not be able to prevent an inevitable hit to household finances from rising inflation and the upcoming April increase in National Insurance.The latest data has revealed that wages are already failing to keep up with steep rises in the cost of living.“Living standards for people in this country will be lower,” he said.“It’s certainly going to come as a shock to consumers as we go through the first part of this year.”He said with Bank action taking two to three years to feed through, “it is only the Government through it’s ious fiscal tools that can do anything there”.Sir Charlie also cautioned over a hit to UK economic growth of up to % from the Omicron iant of coronavirus and the restrictions imposed before Christmas.He said the UK may be heading for a contraction in the first quarter as staff shortages have taken their toll and hospitality firms suffer.But with Plan B

Drumlemble, Rhunahaorine and Dalintober primary schools were all badly hit with absences, around a third of the total roll in each case, but in all three schools the staff fortunately remained relatively unaffected with only one or two teachers being off.Elsewhere in Campbeltown, both Castlehill and Saint Kieran#s primary schools also remained largely unaffected, with absent rates remaining below  per cent.And outside South Kintyre, few schools were affected whatsoever.The Campbeltown Health Centre reported a comparatively typical level of demand for this time of year with a spokesperson saying that it had not been particularly affected by the minor epidemic.The post-Christmas blues seem to have struck fisherman just as much as everyone  with only , boxes of fish being landed last week.One or two boats started back the weekend after New Year, but the majority waited until Monday before venturing out.Catches were good at the start of the week but, as the week progressed, strong tides forced them to drop.Four Northern Irish boats started the week fishing around Kintyre but, by Wednesday, there were only two and, by Thursday, there were none.The scallop boats which were working around the west side of Kintyre moved round to the Clyde mid-week, but catches remained poor all over and with the New Year, the majority of the creel boats seem to have given up fishing for buckies.FIFTY YEARS AGOSeveral Campbeltown streets were flooded on Tuesday when torrential rain, which later turned to sleet, fell incessantly.Worst hit in the burgh was, as usual, Lochend, where streets were under several feet of water and some low-doored premises were in danger of being washed out.Glebe Street, Ralston Road and parts of Meadows Road were also badly affected.The Campbeltown to Carradale road was treacherous in places with numerous deep areas of flooding.Drain covers were forced up in dferent parts of the town.The local fishing fleet and other vessels were forced to run for the safety of Campbeltown Harbour when a gale force south easterly wind rose at sea  mm of rain fell during three hours on Tuesday.And the rainfall figure for the first  days of January was almost  inches.Campbeltown had  hours more sunshine in  than in .Top of the sun charts was May, with  hours.

Consider instead a multi-faceted activity ranging from indoor climbing in a centrally-heated gymnasium to drting upwards on sun-warmed granite on a Greek island or, as author Anna Fleming poetically describes it, as a form of vertical dance: “Climbing can be frightening and demanding, but there is also a beauty within the movement. It is a question of timing, precision and agility. A form of dance. And within that absorbing outdoor ballet – when stretching and balancing, reaching and releasing – you come to see things dferently.”In her book, Time On Rock, Edinburgh-based Anna Fleming shares a woman’s perspective on rock-climbing, and that is certainly dferent. I can’t ever recall a male rock-climber writing about the “intricacies of dance and flow”.“Through intensive physical, emotional and creative work on the rock face, a climber can begin to sense the choreography and movements of land. We see in shapes, patterns and sequences we place ourselves within rhythms of time, weather and geology. To spend time on rock is to be immersed, orientated and transported.”It’s not often I find myself quite so beguiled by a book about rock-climbing. In my experience, book and magazine accounts are dominated by grades and personal achievement and are often bereft of any real appreciation of the fundamental element of the activity – the rock itself, or the mountain to which that rock belongs, or the greater landscapes that contain the mountain. Rock-climbing, or a bastardised form of it, is now an Olympic sport, but Anna Fleming’s wonderfully refreshing examination of the pursuit takes it back to its roots - traditional climbing on crags and mountain clfs where the natural world holds sway - and encourages us to fully embrace it.My own tyro climbing exploits, many years ago now, not only taught me the rudiments of climbing, but also how to distinguish between a golden eagle and a buzzard, or between a ring ouzel and a blackbird, a meadow pipit and a skylark. I learned about weather systems, plants, wild flowers – the ecology of the mountains, and during those early climbs I learned the dference between schist and quartzite, andesite and granite. In one impromptu geology lesson from an old climbing gangrel, I sat flabbergasted as he explained how the rock I was climbing on was part of an ancient volcano that erupted through and onto a land surface of Dalradian metamorphic rocks about  million years before. It was my very first geology lesson, and the subject has fascinated me ever since.Those early years taught me the natural world is infinitely more than a playground, or a place where I could test myself – it’s an incredibly ancient, evolving home for countless other creatures and plants with which we share this planet. It’s dficult to learn these thingsyou are taught to climb on an indoor climbing wall.Having said that, indoor walls have a place in the climbing firmament and Anna Fleming certainly recognises that as she praises the opportunities indoor climbing offers to hone techniques in relative safety, to build strength and perhaps most importantly for many, to socialise, for the wide realm of mountaineering contains no more sociable sub-culture than rock climbing. We discover that as Anna takes us on a tour of the some of the UK’s most popular climbing haunts: the Derbyshire gritstone crags of Stanage or Froggat Edge or Shepherd’s Crag in Borrowdale in the Lake District, or Malham Cove in Yorkshire where we wonder at the sheer number of Lycra-clad climbers, chatting, comparing notes, drinking tea and generally supporting each other. Aye, and some of them actually climb too.It’s not quite like that in Scotland, where such roadside crags are fewer in number, but it’s here Anna Fleming comes into her own, despite moving out of her climbing comfort zone. As she takes on the challenges of the big mountain crags, particularly in the Cuillin and the Cairngorms, the comfort and familiarity of the popular roadside crags are exchanged for a more intense experience, as Anna Fleming suggests: “To climb in the Cuillin is to throw yourself into a rocky realm of epic resonance.” In such grand, natural arenas, the scales are so much bigger, the risks are greater and the skills are more complex and profound.Through all of these experiences, the author weaves an intricate and beguiling description of British rock-climbing in all its multi-faceted shades and in doing so emphasises the woman’s perspective. As such, the book’s promotional material inevitably draws comparison with the writing of Nan Shepherd, the Cairngorm poet, and while Anna Fleming’s writings do share an existentialist style it’s important to remember Nan Shepherd was no climber.Shepherd’s writings were confined to the Cairngorms, and her whole contribution to mountain literature was one extremely slim volume. If anything Anna Fleming’s ethos more closely parallels those of the s Welsh rock climber and author, Gwen Moffat, now  years old, who, in a recent interview with Natalie Berry on UKClimbing, said: “When I wrote up my journal shortly after the climbs I was noting the salient points: the interesting moves, weather, exposure, wildle – my reactions to those and to the behaviour of the companyand their obvious reaction to me.”Serendipitously, that quote of Gwen Moffat succinctly describes Time On Rock, an illuminating and poetic appraisal of what it’s like to be a woman in a male-dominated world but more importantly, the subtlety and the rich textures a woman writer can bring to such a male-dominated genre."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13393856.jpg?type=article-full","title":"review-proscenic-t22-smart-air-fryer","story":"A WiFi enabled air fryer with multiple smart controls to help achieve better cooking results and happier homes.Good points With a cooking capacity of five litres, the Proscenic T is capable of rustling up enough food for four people in a clean and convenient way.

During his premiership, support has been as low as .%, though it has been as high as % in October .In other words, any connection between Boris Johnson being Prime Minster and support for independence is no more than the continuation of a trend, with iations around it, that has developed not just under Mr Johnson but successive Westminster prime ministers since at least . Of course, whether this will remain so, only time will tell.What is clear is that Mr Redfern will leave no stone unturned, or barrel unscraped in his never-ending loathing of the very idea of independence. Perhaps the reason is that despite the increasingly desperate attempts by Mr Redfern and his fellow travellers, the independence argument not only has increasingly deep foundations, but is increasing its support in parts of the community who would previously have voted No.It is no wonder that they are worried, but they do themselves no favours by the kind of superficial, and easily disproved statistics that Mr Redfern used this week.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.THE BUCK STOPS AT THE TOPI READ last weeks issueand noted the big dference in the way that Iain Macwhirter and Barrie Cunning saw things. Mr Macwhirterseemed to mostly blame the civil service and Mr Cunningseemed to mostly blame Boris Johnson for the culture of Partygate.I am apolitical in general, with no particular party affiliation, but it seems to me that Mr Cunning has the vast majority of public opinion on his side and Mr Macwhirter very little, however right he may be about the civil service in general.The buck stops at the top, and usually the culture on any ship or in any organisation is dictated from the top.

Many objections to this and other projects in semi-rural areas springs from an understandable but mistaken view that so-called green belts are about nature conservation.When they were first mooted in the s there was scant interest in this and their widespread use has not stopped a huge reduction in the extent of natural meadows, woodland and hedgerows and in bioersity due to modern farming. Indeed it is said that there is now more wildle within towns than in parts of the countryside.The role of green belts was and is to manage urban growth. The proper term is a \"container\". Instead of allowing most expansion on parts of the urban periphery this is pushed into outlying towns and villages, which greatly raises public costs and the amount of time and money spent on travel. House prices within cities are unaffordable for many, and villages become detached suburbs.Another aim is to make infrastructure provision more economic by limiting the amount of land available for building in one period . When most of this is used parts of the green belt are \"released\" for building. Extensions may be made on the outer edge. The London green belt is larger than ever but it has moved far further out.The originator of the approach was a London architect who knew little about landscape or urban geography. He tried and failed to have it adopted in other countries, Scotland being an exception. Towns here have very dferent landscapes from each other so applying one spatial form to all never made sense. Yet that is what happened.Many professional planners have limited understanding of landscape or urban dynamics and know little of approaches used abroad. I prepared plans in several countries but never used a green belt and am pleased that the Highland and Falkirk councils have rejected the idea. The latter has instead adopted a \"greenspace plan\".In the s Glasgow-born Ian McHarg, then professor of landscape and regional planning at the prestigious University of Pennsylvania, wrote a book called Design with Nature. He and others devised an approach they called \"ecological planning\" and used this to formulate a strategy for the whole of New Jersey. I doubt many people here ever read the book or know anything of this approach to planning, yet it is what Central Scotland needs. Green belts belong to the age of steam engines and cannot deal with the complex issues of today.Objectors to this project are right that access to \"greenspace\" is crucial for health but seemingly think that this does not apply to those who need homes. Where these should live is seemingly not their concern.Future residents rarely participate in public consultations. The emphasis is always on the wishes of those who already live in the area and want to stop others also doing so. Just keeping people out of areas like this is not a fair and sensible approach to the problem.To say that the area would be dominated by roads is ludicrous. Such would use a tiny fraction of the area, maybe one per cent of that taken up by parks, reserves and gardensThe idea that only a few people should be allowed to live in areas of high amenity is obnoxious.

The decision to remove facemasks may well prove to be very premature.”Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “The news that there will be further air-cleaning devices made available for schools that need them is welcome.“We urge DfE to continue to monitor the situation carefully and ensure that every school that needs such a device receives one quickly.“The removal of other Covid measures in schools has made good ventilation more important than ever.“The additional payment to secondary schools to support the next stage of the vaccination programme is also welcome.“It’s important to note that it is the medical teams that will continue to be responsible for running the vaccination programme.“However, we learnt from the first round of vaccinations that schools do face some additional administrative burdens in supporting the medical teams and it is right that this has been acknowledged.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642067512749.jpg--take_part_in_this_year_s_big_garden_birdwatch.jpg?1642067512000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220113newstake part in this year s big garden birdwatch","story":"Keep your eyes wide open, get the kettle on and grab your binoculars as RSPB NI encourage you to join in on the charity’s Big Garden Birdwatch this month.

Even a knock or a bump could accelerate the transformation of tissue to bone.Lucy explained that when she and her sister were born their toes were shaped like bunions, one of the “tell tale signs” of FOP.However, at the time little was known about the condition, of which there is no definitive treatment or cure available, and the twins were not diagnosed until aged eight.Zoe explained: “When I was five I fell and broke my arm and it never really healed properly. When we were diagnosed with FOP no-one knew much about it because it was so rare.“At the time it was much harder for our parents as they really took the brunt of it because we were children.“But even now it can still be very hard because we are the only people with FOP in Northern Ireland.”Lucy added: “Back when we were children there was hardly any information about FOP but one person we were able to speak to was Fred Kaplan in Philadelphia.“He was the only person who knew much about it and even nowanything goes wrong we can send him an email.“He dedicates a lot of his time to research into FOP and we are very fortunate to have him.”The sisters, who attended Slemish College, described what it was like growing up in Ballymena with FOP.Zoe said: “We are so lucky to have each other but going to school was dficult in the sense that everyone was able bodied and we weren’t.“We went to Slemish which was such a great college, however, I was quite clumsy so I had to use a wheelchair and it was a bit harder for me because I couldn’t go outside at break times and join my friends.”When Lucy was  she tripped and hurt the back of her neck and the resulting bone growth left her unable to raise her arms above her head. In the same year Zoe broke her leg and was left unable to straighten it.Lucy explained that just recently she experienced a flare-up resulting in her jaw locking.She explained: “Over the last six months I have had a couple of flare-ups and it has been really dficult.“I had swelling under my chin and I couldn’t open my mouth so I had to have liquids.“I just kept telling myself that it won’t last and will get better which it did and I am thankful for that because there are people with FOP whose jaws have locked permanently.”Both Lucy and Zoe share a positive outlook on le which comes from practicing gratitude and not worrying about things outside of their control. Zoe who has a keen interest in interior design works for Ivy and Gold and lives in Cloughmills with her husband Mike whilst Lucy, a content creator, lives in Ballymena with her husband Michael.Zoe said: “I couldn’t get a job anywhere. I knew what I was able to do but no-one would take a chance on me. When I got a job with Ivy and Gold I was so grateful.” For Lucy and Zoe the pandemic has been particularly dficult as they are unable to get the vaccine due to their condition.Zoe said: We are normally together all the time but during lockdown we were from dferent households so we couldnt see each other.Butyou needed to be looked after and needed help you were allowed to go to someone s house so I went to my parents. It was hard for me to be on my own.Neither of us can get the vaccine because we cant have anything injected into our muscles so we have to be very careful.The sisters dont know what the future holds for them but they are determined to “live for the now”.Zoe said: “You cant think too far ahead because we dont know what the future holds for us with FOP.“We think it is best to live for the now becauseyou plan ahead too much you are easily disappointed.”Lucy and Zoe are keen to raise awareness of FOP through their social media channels and particularly want to highlight what signs to look out for.Lucy said: A baby with FOP will have toes that look like bunions and some children will have a joint missing in their thumb.“Spotting these first indicators allows parents to find out sooner rather than later whether or not their child has FOP.A petition to dedicate funding into research for the condition was debated in parliament at the end of last year. Lucy said: “Ian Paisley spoke on behalf of us and did such a good job. He fought our corner and we were very appreciative and hopefully it will go through to the next stage.“At the minute FOP families and friends fundraise but it is extremely hard as there are not that many of us.”Last year Zoes husband Mike and his work colleagues from Spar, Doury Road climbed Slemish and raised pound for FOP Friends.They are also planning to organise more fundraising events for the charity which is the only one in the UK dedicated to supporting people living with FOP and their families.The charity actively fundraises to support research into a treatment and a cure for FOP and more information can be found on their website www.fopfriendsYou can also find out more about Lucy and Zoe by following their Instagram handles which are Lucy Fretwell: allthingsbeautullymade and Zoe Buxton: alittlebitofle "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642778651871.jpg--covid_19___fri_21st_january_figures.jpg?1642778651000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220121newscovid 19 fri 21st january figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

Credit: Niall CarsonLisa SmythTwitterJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailIt is one month since the Executive introduced a raft of restrictions aimed at reducing the spread of Omicron.Put in place just before Christmas and amid warnings that the health service could be overwhelmed by a surge in seriously ill patients, it now appears the iant is up to % less severe than Delta.Read MorePublic split over Executive plan to scrap coronavirus restrictionsGivan ready to abandon Covid passport schemeother Executive parties agreeIn fact, in a briefing paper presented to the Executive this week, ministers were told that while hospital admissions and Covid bed occupancy increased in the last week, they have peaked and started to fall slowly in the last few days.The document went on to explain the numbers of patients requiring supplementary oxygen, ICU occupancy and hospital deaths remained “relatively steady” and Covid- patients in critical care units were “still predominantly a result of Delta infection”.It is likely case numbers are going to rise in the coming weeks as a result of the virus running rampant through schools.This will eventually work its way into older age groups and is likely to result in more people requiring hospital treatment, but the official position is one of cautious optimism.And that’s why, as quickly as they were put in place, measures that business leaders and a public fed with up with two years of disruption to their lives, have been lted.Gone are the rule of six in pubs and restaurants and the requirement for table service in licensed premises has been lted, while the self-isolation period for positive cases has been dropped to five days.Meanwhile, from noon on Wednesday, further rules are to be relaxed, including dropping the use of Covid certicates at pubs, restaurants and cinemas, the reopening of nightclubs and the resumption of dancing and indoor standing events.And the First Minister has also indicated all remaining restrictions, such as legal requirements on face masks and regular lateral flow testing, could be scrapped next month.There does appear to be a growing sense that the worst may be over for Northern Ireland.Indeed, the World Health Organisation’s Covid chief has suggested the end of the pandemic is in sight for Britain.And Professor Devi Sridhar, Professor and Chair of Global Public Health at Edinburgh University, has also provided a chink of light.Writing in thethis week, she said: “Delaying and preventing infection as much as possible through this pandemic was a worthwhile strategy.“In early , there were few treatments, limited testing and no vaccines.“The cost of those lockdowns were big, but the effort to buy time paid off. In that time, sciences has transformed Covid from a deadly virus to a much less serious, nasty disease — one that is manageable at home, for the vast majority of those vaccinated.“It has, largely, defanged, it.”Of course, as with everything in science, this isn’t a position shared by everyone.Dr Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist and statistical geneticist, has expressed alarm at the rolling back of restrictions. It comes amid an estimated , new cases of Covid- in Northern Ireland every day and a daily tally of more than , positive cases across the UK.“I certainly don’t think we are approaching the tail of the pandemic,” she said.“I have seen no evidence to indicate that and when you are recording more than , cases a day, to say the pandemic is over, it’s nonsense.“I can’t think of any country in the world that is lting restrictions when it’s recording more than , cases a day.”However, Northern Ireland’s chief scientic adviser, Professor Ian Young, has said he is “cautiously optimistic” about the future.“It is the World Health Organization that makes the call on whether it is a pandemic,” he explained.“We may move to a position where the virus becomes part of the background here, but it is still causing big problems in other countries.“I don’t think we’re near the end of the pandemic yet but I think in terms of the way the virus is behaving in this country, I think that we’re moving to a position where it will be endemic.“I think I am delighted as everyone  is that we’re in a position to be able to relax some of the restrictions, no-one wants to see those in place any longer than required.“I believe the Executive has made a very reasonable decision to take the brakes off but not throw everything out the window, and waiting to see how things go over the next three weeks before making the next round of decisions.”So,the statistics continue to move in the right direction and Northern Ireland comes out from under the shadow of Omicron without suffering the catastrophe threatened before Christmas, will le as we knew it before Covid- resume A major question for the Executive will be whether they keep in place the current testing and contact tracing infrastructure once the threat of Omicron has passed.Another consideration — how long will the Department of Health continue to update its daily Covid- dashboard with statistics on daily cases, hospitalisations and deaths Most experts now agree the figures cannot be relied upon given the current testing regime, so how much do we actually learn from the daily update Also, will Northern Ireland remain in crisis mode evenit regards Covid- as endemic while other countries around the world continue to struggle At what stage will our hospitals be able to resume elective surgery to any degree that it stops the spiralling waiting lists And what threat is posed by another iant It is true that the vaccines are playing a major role in keeping people safe — but we cannot exclude the possibility of a vaccine resistant iant that results in serious illness.Professor Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “It could happen next month or it could happen in  years. “As we have seen throughout the pandemic, it’s impossible to predict what is going to happen.”Prof Young has also said he cannot rule out the possibility, although he stressed “it would be unlucky”.Assuming that we are now finally moving beyond the almost permanent crisis state in which we have existed for almost two years, what next It is naïve — and dare I say it somewhat selfish— to think we are going toto a world without some form of public health measures once the worst of Omicron has passed.While for the majority of people, Covid- will be a self-limiting illness that can be treated at home, there will be those who are still clinically extremely vulnerable. Even with the vaccines and advances in treatments, the virus will still claim lives.What measures will the public accept to ensure the tens of thousands of people regarded as extremely vulnerable to the virus don’t have to remain locked away indefinitely In herarticle, Prof Sridhar stressed evenCovid- is endemic, “that doesn’t mean harmless”.She continued: “Endemic means that we accept a circulation of a disease because elimination or eradication is perceived as too dficult.“Malaria, dengue and measles are endemic in certain parts of the world even though they are all serious diseases.“Malaria was endemic in the United States until the government decided to eliminate it.“This is part of a larger question about how much we continue to alter what ‘normal’ social relations are, given the circulation of Sars-CoV-.“Humans are social, we need to hug, dance, sing and recognise each other’s faces and smiles. A sense of community and connection are vital to wellbeing too.“Public health is not about one disease, it is broadly about well-being, which includes mental health and being able to pay the rent, feed your family, stay warm through winter and have a meaningful role in society.”To do this, we need to develop better ways of living alongside Covid-.For Dr Ultan Power, professor of molecular virology at Queen’s University in Belfast, this includes more research to establish levels of immunity and theof time people remain infectious.This would, he said, allow policy makers to make better and more informed decisions over the likes of self-isolation.“If we could develop a rapid test that predicts how long someone is infectious, not whether they are still positive, that would be very helpful,” he explained.Meanwhile, experts such as Dr Gurdasani and Dr Gabriel Scally, visiting professor of public health at the University of Bristol, are clear that measures such as air filtration systems in schools will protect children across Northern Ireland from all airborne disease.The Education Minister has so far resisted calls for their implementation, citing insufficient evidence to warrant the £m bill.However, the hope is that our politicians and officials will take steps now to keep us safe in the future.If the pandemic has taught us anything, it is that a novel virus, capable of killing millions of people around the world is not just a Hollywood concept but can become a reality within a matter of months.Related topicsThe Executive OfficeDelta iantDepartment of HealthDepartment of EducationMore On The Executive Office PremiumViewpointOpinionOpinion poll a mixed bag for the DUPGivan ready to abandon Covid passport schemeother Executive parties agree PremiumConsiderable unionist support for DUP stance on scrapping ProtocolDisaster for DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson as Sinn Fein extends lead to eight points PremiumViewpointOpinionFreedom comes at a price for everyoneMost ReadTwo men die following crash on Belfast’s Ravenhill RoadAntrim UDA crime boss Andrew Wilson-Smith selling Kinahan cartel cocaineLuxury million-pound Co Down home with breath-taking views of Belfast LoughRavenhill Road crash: Belfast man Jon O’Hara one of two deaths, while PSNI arrest manin relation to collisionClokey House in The Spa one of Co Down’s most impressive contemporary luxury homesTop VideosPlayVideo: Surfer rescues two people after kayak overturns in PortrushPlayVideo - Three police cars damaged as hijacked car collides with church wall in BelfastPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy Latest CoronavirusGame Changer Awards to honour and celebrate Northern Ireland’s inspirational sportswomenGivan ready to abandon Covid passport schemeother Executive parties agreeFirst Minister Paul Givan urges NI Covid passport to be ‘withdrawn in all settings’Public split over Executive plan to scrap coronavirus restrictionsMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageLatestLiverpool bomber’s asylum claim rejected by court six years before attackAnxious England hold off stirring West Indies fightback to level T seriesUS draws down Ukraine embassy presence as war fears mountGarda reports of domestic abuse in Ireland rose by % in Jack Grealish put in his best Man City display at Southampton – Pep Guardiola,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

is expected to start shortly on a major internal upgrade at Ballynahinch Community Centre.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has drawn up plans to reconfigure the internal layout of the Windmill Street facility as part of a signicant investment initiative.Local people are being asked for their views on the planned upgrade which could be completed as early as the summer and cost in the region of pound,.Confirmation that work is to start soon on the centre upgrade has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who has also thanked Strangford MP Jim Shannon and her council colleague Billy Walker for their support in driving the renovation programme forward.She revealed that she had been contacted by a number of residents about the slow progress of the scheme and is pleased that everything is now on track.In addition to the planned work at the community centre, consideration is also being given to investing around pound, to finance internal alterations of the local authority-owned Market House in the town centre.And the Recorder understands that consideration is being given to providing an ultra-modern G sports pitch at the Langley Road playing fields with the adjoining sports pavilion also in line for a major upgradeA number of politicians have been lobbying for the local authority to address what they described as the organisationrsquos ldquounder investment in Ballynahinch and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities is a critical component of its future investment plans.Council officials had previously been asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.However, they have opted to commit pound, on a major upgrade of the existing complex which will include a reconfiguration of the internal floorspace in a bid to increase the buildingrsquos usage.Politicians say they are keen to work in partnership with council officials and the Ballynahinch Community Collective to improve sports and community provision in the town to meet the needs of a wide range of people.Elected representatives say Ballynahinch needs to be at the heart of planned investment in future leisure provision across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Politicians are keen to ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out when it comes to leisure provision investment, given the money that has already spent in other towns across the council area.They believe that the good working relationship that exists between elected representatives across the Rowallane area can ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out on future funding opportunitiesand that the needs of the townrsquos community are met, particularly when it comes to modern leisure, sports and community provision.Politicians want Ballynahinch to be included in any future strategy when it comes to leisure activities and provision, warning that the town cannot afford be left behind.They say the current community centre requires a much-needed upgrade with the current proposal a major step in the right direction.Elected representatives say that given the local council spend on major schemes in other parts of the district, the ratepayers of Ballynahinch deserve nothing less than an upgrade community

And as well as their cultural signicance the implications for the economic and tourism attraction of the historic centre of the county are obvious.They add: ldquoWe call on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to halt its current direction of travel and demonstrate a commitment to restoring what was an internationally recognised centre of excellence in Downpatrick.ldquoWe ask it to respect its moral responsibility to honour the trust placed in the museum by those thousands of donors and friends who expected the council to cherish and support this public treasure house of the shared histories of County Down.Last week a spokesperson for the council said it was ldquocommitted to the continuous improvement and development of its museums.The spokesperson also said a meeting was held in December with stakeholders and elected representatives to clary there would be a reduction in ldquostaff head count following the restructuring.ldquoFurther engagement with stakeholders is planned for early this year and we look forward to working with all our partners to advance the councilrsquos ambitious and exciting plans for our museum services, the spokesperson added.See Letters on pages  and ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"Down go under against Antrim  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo disappointing start to their Dr McKenna Cup campaign continued when they lost out to Antrim by two points in Newry last week.The defeat means back-to-back losses for James McCartanrsquos new-look side, despite some encouraging inidual performances throughout from the Mourne outfit.Down will count themselves unlucky not to gain anything from the contest, having gone tit for tat with the Saffrons in the first half and Barry OrsquoHagan seeing his last gasp goal bound effort ricocheting over the bar instead of hitting the back of the net.McCartanrsquos men got off to a dream start when the newly ed Niall McParland sent a long ball forward into the hands of Ryan OrsquoHiggins, who opened the scoring through a well struck goal just three minutes in.Ruairi McCann and Odhran Eastwood confidently kicked over frees to bring Antrim within one point of levelling the scores before Packie OrsquoHagan doubled Downrsquos lead just before the  minute mark.Antrim did manage to completely reduce the deficit before the first water-break, with two quick-fire scores coming from Patrick McBride and a Pat Shivers free.As the players rehydrated, the surrounding supporters at Pairc Esler were awarded time to catch their breath as the fast paced game was momentarily brought to a halt.Veteran Darren OrsquoHagan entered the fray in the place of John McGeough upon the resumption before James Laverty kicked over a point from play to give the visitors the lead for the first time in the match.A well worked attack ended with Kevin McKernan levelling proceedings once again for the hosts, and soon after captain Caolan Mooney fired over between the sticks to give his side the advantage.Things began heating up in the cold weather, with plenty of firm challenges on show.Anytime the Mourne side were edging ahead, Antrim were right on their coattails and were now starting to overpower the home side in dferent areas of the pitch.Antrimrsquos McCann kicked over two unanswered points, the first from a rsquorsquo and the second from a free, although Downrsquos sharpshooting Barry OrsquoHagan restored parity in a matter of seconds.With three minutes to the interval, McCann converted his fourth free of the night to give the Saffrons a one point lead.Half time: Down - Antrim -.Down boss McCartan made his second change of the night in the form of Ross Carr swapping out Josh Connery to help give his county a dferent option at the back, although they conceded their first goal of the contest a minute into the restart.Patrick McBride duly converted a fisted effort past Downrsquos Rory Burns after Antrim team-mate Jamie McCann powered his way through the home defence.Down responded positively, splitting the sticks three times unanswered with scores from a Barry OrsquoHagan free and a brace of points from play through McKernan and Darren OrsquoHagan.After over ten minutes without a score on the board, Antrim finally kicked over the bar through Michael McCann.Causing further problems for Down, McCann proved important at both sides of the pitch when he managed to catch lsquokeeper Burnsrsquo attempted rsquo to rule out any chance of a goal.At the second water-break, the home side trailed by two with it all still to play for as both sides made changes.Barry OrsquoHagan took the mark and knocked over a brace of frees to level the scores but once again, Antrim would not be deterred and replied with a point from play by substitute Conor Murray.As the clock ticked down the next few scores would be vital in deciding the outcome and unfortunately for the home support they wouldnrsquot be given much more to cheer about.With two minutes of regulation time to go, Patrick McBride struck over what looked like an insurance point for the Saffrons.As the official announced three minutes of added time, Down pressed high in search of that crucial goal to share the points.With one last opportunity awarded to Down in the form of a free, Barry OrsquoHagan stepped up to fire his effort towards the net.However, the ball would have to travel past a sea of Antrim bodies that had smartly piled across the goal line.Agonisingly, OrsquoHaganrsquos effort smashed off the opposing Antrim wall of defence before clipping the crossbar on its way over to give the visitors a dramatic victory.Down: R Burns P Fegan, B McArdle, G Collins J Connery, N McParland, J McGeough A Doherty, L Middleton R OrsquoHiggins , C Mooney , C OrsquoRawe B OrsquoHagan , P OrsquoHagan , K McKernan Subs: D OrsquoHaganfor McGeough, R Carr for Connery, T Prenter for P OrsquoHagan.

So far the youths have engaged in wanton vandalism of ious areas of the village including putting dog faeces through letter boxes and damaging the villagersquos Christmas tree and festive lights last month.The RUC says it is vital that members of the public provide information which will bring an end of the vandalism problem.ldquoWe need the help of the community to bring those responsible to court, and without that help it will be very dficult to put an end to this problem, he said.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Management at the GPT telecommunications plant in Ballynahinch have pledged to work towards ensuring that it continues to have a future following the weekend announcement of  redundancies.The company, which manufactures hi-tech switching equipment for the telecommunications industry, revealed on Friday that it is to slice its workforce by more than half.The job losses will reduce the workforce at the Antrim Road plant to .

The branches were burnt on a bonfire, and all plastic collected was taken to Drumnakelly dump for safe disposal.Among the workers who took part in the work day was Mrs Sheila Lewis-Crosby, who along with her husband John is the owner of the mill pond. She and Drumaness woman Mrs Carmel Mason cleared brambles constructing a path alongside the dam.After the clean-up, the secretary of the Friends of Drumaness, Dam Lisa Fagan, congratulated the volunteers and thanked local councillor Patsy Toman for initiating the venture.ldquoThe Drumaness people can be proud of our achievement here today, she said. ldquoThere is no doubt that the whole community is sickened by these incidents, he added.DOWNPATRICK ndash People who take part in the after-dark practice of ldquolamping rabbits have this week been warned they are placing themselves in danger.The RUC has warned that people who dress up in combat clothing and walk around fields hunting rabbits with firearms could find themselves being confronted by a security force patrol.Over the Christmas and New Year period, the RUC received reports of ldquolamping in the Downpatrick and Crossgar areas and it also believed to have occurred around Saintfield.The practice has been a problem in the Castlewellan area for a number of years but it is relatively unknown in east Down.It involves hunters going into fields without farmersrsquo permission and shooting rabbits by torchlight.

It is incredible that the Conservative Party is so mishandling the local economy that a scheme of such major importance to Comber and the outlying areas can be postponed to a date four years from now, Mr Taylor said this week.ldquoThe Minister met myself and a delegation of Ards Borough councillors last year and he agreed that Comber by-pass was a priority scheme Now he has shelved it for four years.ldquoI can understand slippage of a few months due to existing schemes costing more than has already been planned but a four year delay is out of the question.Mr Taylor said he has spoken to local members of his partyrsquos Comber branch and they are ldquohorried at the decision.BISHOPSCOURT ndash A total of around  local residents have signed a petition opposing proposals to turn the former Bishopscourt airfield into a motor-race track.The petition organisers say they are delighted by the response which indicates a ldquothumbs-down by the majority of people living in the area.ldquoThe residents all live in the immediate vicinity of the airfield or along the Downpatrick to Ballyhornan road, and so are the people most likely to be affectedthe planned track were to go ahead, explained a spokesman this week.The residents say they are concerned at proposals, currently with the Planning Service in Downpatrick, to turn part of the former air base at Ballyhornan into a race track.A spokesman said the petition is to be sent to the planning authorities and to the Minister for the Environment, Mr Richard Needham, this week.

All statutory consultees bar one have now given the proposal their approval, with discussions with the final consultee in progress.Association officials say the planning application covers only the paths, pond, fencing and information  associated with the field close to the community centre.ldquoMany hours have been put in completing the application to the Heritage Fund which was submitted at the end of November with a decision due in March, Saintfield News confirms, explaining thatthe bid is successful, it will be for the development phase of the project.ldquoThis will probably take one year and will include detailed measurements of the scheduled monument buildings, work plans, costings for stabilising these and obtaining scheduled monument consent and planning approval for these works.ldquoAt the end of this development phase a further application to the Heritage Fund would be made for the delivery phase of the project. ldquoThe association says thatthis was successful and all went well, the park and windmill would be opened to the public in the spring of .However,the Heritage Fund application is unsuccessful, the association will proceed with the proposal, but the work would exclude the scheduled monument area.ldquoThis would be fenced off as unsafe and left as is, reports Saintfield News. ldquoCompetition for Heritage Fund grants is very competitive and many other projects in Northern Ireland will be applying. It will be a great achievementwe are successful.ldquoThis is probably the only source of funding that can preserve the windmill and the other two buildings of the scheduled monument for future generations.

It has been highly infectious but has had minor health impacts.This is a time to celebrate the success of the vaccine programme, above all in the United Kingdom — a country of which we are lucky to be a part given that is a global scientic leader and played a key role in developing the medications.It is also a time to recognise the way in which the great bulk of people have, cheerfully enough, adapted to the new considerate ways of living in a pandemic.This experience will almost certainly help us to respond much more quickly to any future viral outbreak. Many people, for example, will want to continue to wear masks even when they cease to be mandatory.It might yet be that there is fresh, more dangerous outbreak of Covid. But we can no longer put le on hold due to that possibility.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.My understanding is that there was no wider agreement between the Tories and Sir Jeffrey, who put a brave face this week on the u-turn.It puts him in a tricky situation after he becomes a Stormont MLA.First there will be a Westminster by-election in Lagan Valley, where the DUP majority in  was slashed from, in , a colossal , votes over the next nearest rivalto a still clear but uncomfortably reduced majority of , over Alliance.But it also greatly undermines a key point of leverage for Sir Jeffrey.Owen Polley on page   writes about how the DUP pledge to end this term of Stormont and force an election in the absence of reform to the NI Protocol has now been rendered almost meaningless by delays in London’s deadline for an EU deal.The DUP did however have another card: it could have taken advantage of emerging legislation to make Stormont more stable, which would allow an increased six month period after May’s elections before an executive must be formed. The party could have stalled on agreeing to such a formationit didn’t have a result on the Irish Sea border.ButSir Jeffrey will be without a Westminster seat then he will be known to be in the same situation Arlene Foster found herself after  – effectively jobless unless Stormont is operating as normal.Thus the u-turn by Boris Johnson this week leaves the DUP with badly reduced options. The party also looks isolated amid the joint six-party approach to Mr Johnson against the double jobbing plan.This must all be a joy for Sinn Fein. On one issue or another they have found themselves joined by almost all of the parties as signatories in petitions to power against ious topics of the day.They enjoyed multi-party photo opportunities for their demand for an Irish language act, yet I never recall a single multi-party approach to London or Dublin calling on the two governments to ensure that SF’s collapse of Stormont in  did not get political reward .Sinn Fein enjoyed four-party approaches to the EU both before the NI Protocol was agreed, and after .On double jobbing it finds itself alongside the Ulster Unionist Party in its joint approach to Downing St. And there was a notable moment last year when Paul Givan observed that SF was, like the other parties, opposed to the government legacy plan, and he said the party could influence such debates by taking its Westminster seats. This gave a sense of common purpose, which was unfortunate given that the republican role in the Troubles is at the core of unionist dislike of SF. You might expect that on legacy, above all issues, unionists would express contempt for the republican stance on an amnesty, and emphasise that their rejection of the proposed stay on prosecutions is for reasons opposite to those of SF.But whatever mis-steps unionists make, it is only fair to note that they get little consistent, heavyweight support at Westminster.Every so often this paper is alerted to a sympathetic question that a pro unionist peer has asked in the Lords, soliciting a seemingly unionist answer from a minister. But this is no match for Tory MPs such as Julian Smith and Simon Hoare, the influential NI Affairs Committee chair, who speak up as soon as Ireland is upset about something. Hoare, an MP who is swt to dismiss unionist concerns , this week led the Commons chorus against the double jobbing move. The government soon buckled to his arguments.• Ben Lowryis News Letter editor• Ben Lowry: My memory of  Meat Loaf concert in Belfast• Ben Lowry January : Double jobbing change seems to be bid by London to shore up the DUP• Owen Polley: Flip-flopping prime minister can’t be relied on to sort out the Northern Ireland Protocol"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland is lucky to have kenneth branagh as an ambassador ","story":"Work starts on £m hotel plan at former military base   Murder of Sir Norman Stronge recalled on anniversary of ‘barbarous’ IRA attackNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsOpinionNorthern Ireland is lucky to have Kenneth Branagh as an ambassadorNews Letter editorial of Saturday January  :By EditorialSaturday, nd January , : amUpdated Saturday, nd January , : am  \"       \"  News Letter editorialFrom Stephen Boyd to Liam Neeson, some Northern Ireland have found fame in Hollywood.Ken Branagh is one of the most successful of them all.

The broadcaster says his family is his proudest achievement alongside singing, performing and broadcasting. Duncan says he is never happier than when he is on air and forgets all his personal troubles as soon as he begins his weekly show on BBC Radio UlsterThe ever popular broadcaster explains how his music career took off when the showband era was at its height. At first he could only play three or so chords on the guitar with a capo, but he didn’t let that deter him, and while muso bosses at first demurred at making him a frontman because of his diminutive stature, they eventually relented.“I used to sing on my own in bars in Strabane and all over, then I was gigging with a wee band all over the country for £ or £. a night. That was certainly a long time ago. “I remember I turned  on a Thursday, March ,  I was married the following Thursday and the following Thursday fortnight my mother Susie who raised me on her own died.Hugo having a lark at an outside broadcast pre-pandemic. During lockdown he most missed driving as he likes to travel all over the country from his native Strabane to Kerry, Waterford, Wexford and other parts of the Republic“A close friend of mine, Theo, was a presenter on Highland Radio, who was in a band called The Polka Dots who were managed by Barney Curley. I would say my voice is good, but I’m definitely no Mario Lanza. “The management team tried to oust me because I was small, five foot five . They wanted a traditional six foot frontman, but then they went with Hugo Duncan and The Tall Men, because my friend Pio McCann said to them, “Well, are you looking for a singer or a male model ’ And so I was signed up.He added: “When we had our hit with Dear God in the Irish charts we were walking on air. We lived for today and tomorrow would look after itself. We were at one point one of the top three bands in Ireland. “But then I got into the drink in a big way, from the early s until the  December , and I have not had an alcoholic drink since then, thank God. I just stick to Coca-Cola or orange juice, but I still love being in bars.”He met his we Joan, the love of his le, while they were both working at a nylon factory in Strabane and he credits her almost entirely with keeping him grounded.Hugo recalls: “I was backward about coming forwards on the matter. She used to work in the Gorey Cinema in Newtownstewart selling ice cream, but even when we were courtin’ she wouldn’t have given me a free one.“We were courtin’ from , for  months, then I was working a night sht and I was standing in the hallway of her own house to give her a good night kiss. “There was a song on the radio playing ‘I will never be married, I’ll be no man’s we’ and I just said ‘Will you marry me ’ And that was it. It all happened up against the coats.”A huge hit on the air waves, and particularly with an older demographic of listeners, although plenty of young country music fans tune in frequently too, he is sustained by his Christian faith.“I believe in God and I would pray every day, but I wouldn’t force my religion on anybody. “People say we are two communities here, but we both, Protestant and Catholic, have far more in common than what ides us. “We all bleed when we are cut, we all cry when we are hurt. “I love that my programme goes to every part of Northern Ireland and I think this mutual love of country music can bring us all together - everyone loves the best of country music old and new across Ulster.”‘I WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY AS MUCH AS I CAN’“My new year’s resolutions are to broadcast as much as I can, sing as much as I can and make people happy as much as I can,” says Hugo, who does come across as one of the most cheery people you could meet and that palpable sense of bonhomie and banter and good craic is so apparent on the air waves that it’s no wonder his show is such a hit.He started out in radio after being offered a slot at a station based in Donegal.Hugo recalls: “I began on Donegal Radio and then moved to Radio Foyle, doing  minutes here a and there and then I got a show with Radio Ulster, initially on a Saturday night, and I began to say during a wee teaser ‘Now we’ll play a song for the children before they go to bed, so phone in and tell your Uncle Hugo what you would like to hear played.’ “And then that moniker just stuck with me.”Uncle Hugo, as he prefers to be known, joined Radio Foyle during the s doing holiday relief, after which he was offered a job presenting his own weekly show. In October , he began presenting on BBC Radio Ulster.UNCLE HUGO UP THERE WITH THE NEWS LETTER’S BILLY KENNEDY AS COUNTRY MUSIC CONNOISSEURThough a much-loved radio star, an adept performer and someone with a forensic knowledge of country music to rival the News Letter’s very own in-house expert Billy Kennedy, Hugo insists that his proudest achievement in le is without question his family.“My we Joan, my daughter Suzanne and my grandchildren are the lights of my le - absolutely. “But after that I love being able to sing and entertain and more than anything, from the soles of my feet to the very top of my scalp, to try to bring people joy. I just love trying to make people happy and seeing a smile on their faces. “Also, I once sang in the Royal Albert Hall, at Villanova University and in New York.“I love singing in and around Strabane, in Lford and where in Donegal because there’s a whole network of people I know very well there.“I have always lived in Strabane, I love Strabane and I intend to die in Strabane.”I ask him why he thinks the popularity of country music is so predominant across the province.“I think it’s because so many of a certain generation grew up in the showband era and a lot of them were popularising country music. “From the s on the showbands and country music were very much loved here.“The next generation of Irish country singers coming along like Derek Ryan and Nathan Carter and Lisa McHugh, things are much more dferent for them in that they’re so much more business and PR savvy but a lot of the time they are doing covers of older songs like stuff from Foster and Allen and all the older great country music stars - there are so many of them close to my heart that it’s virtually impossible to list them all.“Butyou’re chatting about Irish country music, then a hugely important artist, in my view, is Daniel O’Donnell. “He would get up and sing for ten people with as much dedication and enthusiasm as he would sing for , people, and whatever the size of the audience he holds them captive, just in the palm of his hand.“He’s honestly a lovely human being and in my view a top musical performer - one of my absolute favourites, in fact, and someone I deeply respect.”As a celebrity broadcaster Hugo could well get a big head, but he insists this is not the case.“But I do love when I go to supermarkets and people will meet me and ask for photographs and a chat and my we gets angry because I would really stop and chat with everybody, and she’d rather I just pushed the trolley as fast as I can,” he laughs.QA: ‘GOD BLESS LITTLE CHILDREN, WHILE THEY’RE TOO YOUNG TO HATE’Tell us some of your earliest childhood memories I grew up with just my mother Susie and I in a terrace house. There was always music and a welcome in our house and my wee mother used to say she was always singing that she was “always a bridesmaid and never a bride”.We were very close to our neighbours. In those days nobody locked their doors and I was always really well looked after. I would have went in there, say next door, and they would say ‘Come on in here, Hugh’ - never Hugo, ‘To get a cup of tea and a piece of bread and butter and that will do you until you get your dinner.’ And then my godmother was always making buns for me, and I was in and out of all the houses nearby on my street.Tell us about your school days I was never academic and I was always more drawn to music, especially once my mother bought me a band kit with Providence cheques, I was always singing and gigging about the place. I think I have a short attention span.I didn’t mind arithmetic, but once they got into all those equations and all, then I switched off. I hated PE and sports.What is the secret of your the longevity of your marriage Joan is the backbone of everything, and our daughter Suzanne arrived just a year after our marriage in . We now have four grandchildren, Jake, Ellie-Mae, Molly-Jay,and Katie-Sue. Things were tough when Suzanne had cancer but we got through it all and I really think my Joan is the one who holds all the family together - she has a very strong Christian faith.Tell us your favourite country music artists Tom T Hall, a real singer songwriter and story-teller, and I actually went to his home on two dferent occasions to interview him with a film crew. He wrote a song called Old Dogs and Children and Watermelon Wine and the line of the song that really hit me and spoke to me from the moment I heard it was ‘God bless little children, while they’re still too young to hate’. I also love George Jones, Merle Haggard, Buck Owen - all the old country singers.But I love all kinds of music and singing all kinds of songs. I appreciate traditional, jazz and lots of other genres, but country always comes first. What is your favourite way to spend a day I love driving, and being in transit. I used to do -k miles a year driving up and down Ireland, all over. From home to Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Wexford, Galway, almost every county. And I just love getting out and singing and performing with a band because the buzz you get from doing what you do on stage is second to none.Listen to Hugo Duncan on BBC Radio Ulster, Wednesdays, from .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"key date ahead as all restrictions to be reviewed ","story":"Work starts on £m hotel plan at former military base   DUP saysgovernment will axe double-jobbing due to lack of support in NI then why won’t it axe the Irish Sea border NewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPeople‘Key date’ ahead as ‘all restrictions’ to be reviewedThe next Stormont Executive meeting could be a “key date” as Northern Ireland hopes to move out of the coronavirus pandemic, Health Minister Robin Swann has said.By Niall DeeneySaturday, nd January , : amUpdated Saturday, nd January , : am  \"       \"  He was looking ahead to the next meeting on February , after the Executive agreed to remove several of the restrictions still in place when it met on Thursday.Following that meeting, a spokesperson for the Executive Office at Stormont confirmed that “all remaining covid measures will be reviewed” on February .While Mr Swann has sounded a note of cautious optimism, it is far from certain the remaining restrictions will be dispensed with when the Executive meets again in under three weeks.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

A number of restrictions were changed including the ending of table service only in pubs and restaurants. Jade Dawson and Lydia Hope, who are on holiday from England, enjoy a drink in the DuKe of York in Belfast City Centre. Picture by Jonathan Porter PressEyeThe News Letter has spoken to several members of the Stormont health committee, from a range of parties, who expressed caution when it comes to the lting of remaining rules.The Alliance Party’s Paula Bradshaw said it would be “unrealistic” to assume all remaining rules will be dropped so soon.Mr Swann’s UUP colleague, Alan Chambers, said he is “reluctant to read too much into” the announcement that all remaining restrictions would soon be reviewed.The DUP’s Deborah Erskine, however, urged ministers to remember that coronavirus restrictions are only to be kept in place as long as they are deemed “absolutely necessary”.Minister for Health Robin SwannMr Swann, meanwhile, spoke to the media in Antrim after a swathe of restrictions were relaxed, including an end to the legal requirement for Covid certication to enter some hospitality venues, and the reopening of nightclubs. “I have always taken the decision at the time in regards to the advice that was put forward via my chief medical officer and chief scientic adviser, so February , while it will be a key date, let’s make sure we get there safely and as collectively as we can,” he said.“I would still encourage people to follow the guidance, follow the regulations that are still in place and take the opportunities to come forward and get their vaccines and their boosters.“There are three weeks to go and I want to keep the trajectory of this virus going in the same direction as it has been, and that’s downwards.”Ms Bradshaw, speaking to the News Letter, said: “Everything, at every stage, of every Executive meeting has been reviewed and looked at so I think it’s unrealistic to assume that there will certainly be this huge lting of remaining restrictions as there has been in England.“I don’t think we will see them go away as quickly as the announcement of that date would suggest. “We are still getting , cases per day. I think that, obviously, there is less death but there are still people dying every day and there are still a lot of people on ventillators fighting for their lives. “We are certainly not out of the woods yet.”Mr Chambers said: “It’s not unusual that the Executive are going to review all restrictions in early February. “I’m reluctant to read too much into it, because at every Executive meeting everything is under review. “There isn’t anything unusual about that, and I wouldn’t read too much into ‘nudge, nudge, wink, wink’ suggestions that have been coming from some members of the Executive.“Yes, everything will be considered, but it will absolutely depend on the scientic and medical advice. Now, we all want to see normality and we want to get back to the things we had taken for granted.“Everything is always on the table. There’s a Covid taskforce that reports and it reports at every Executive meeting, as would the chief medical officer and thechief scientic advisor.”He added: “We [the UUP] follow and support the medical and scientic advice. We do not lobby for a particular thing to happen.”Ms Erskine said: “Decisions taken by the Executive need to be evidence based, targeted and effective. “There has always been a duty on ministers to ensure that restrictions are in place for no longer than is absolutely necessary. “When decisions are next taken on February  that must be the guiding principle again.“As we hopefully see the medical threat from Covid- continue to reduce, there must also be a renewed focus on the economic impact of restrictions and how we can best support businesses refocus and rebuild.”Robin SwannStormont ExecutiveNorthern Ireland  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularYoung unionists react to BBC’s Stephen Nolan: Why our peers don’t want to speak out in the mediaPSNI: Two men killed in road traffic collisionWatch the reaction of some of the first people to see Belfast film on official UK release dateWilliam Crawley: Seeing Belfast film was like living my childhood againBen Lowry: The double jobbing u-turn leaves the DUP with reduced options at StormontMost PopularBest men’s dressing gowns: ten of the most luxurious bathrobes for men to keep you cosy and dryHome office desks UK: make smart use of the space you have with the best desks for small spacesBest boxed mattress deals for January: discounts on Emma, Simba, Nectar, Eve, Dreamcloud and OTTYBest bread makers - tried and tested, from Panasonic, Morphy Richards, and LakelandBest electric heaters UK: portable electric, ceramic, and fan heaters from Dimplex, De’Longhi, Silentnight                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLast year because we were in deep lockdown it never happened and because of the current Covid rules it had to be postponed again, which is probably why only three walkers came out to meet him at the Knap car terrace in perfect walking weather, on a bright and crisp morning to join in a -mile replacement walk.On the hillside just above them are the neat foundations of a Roman Building which contained  rooms all grouped around a courtyard with the building being dated to the late rd century AD by the Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust. It seems a natural harbour was to be found to the east of this area and one theory is that this was a guesthouse connected with naval activity at the harbour as no evidence of a water supply or baths common in villa’s could be found. In the early ’s the trust carried out excavations on site and pieces of Roman pottery and tiles were found and a public viewing  now overlooks the site.They soon warmed up due to a short but stf climb onto the clftop and followed a narrow path through woodland to descend the Golden Stairs into Porthkerry Country Park, where the frost covered board walk led them towards the ft Porthkerry Viaduct. Deviating off the cycle path at Robin’s Walk brought them into muddy fields beside the Whitelands Brook for the climb up to join the A opposite Welford and along the verge to cross a stile leading into fields behind Blackton Farm.A well-worn farm track led to the road for the journey to Penmark Village where they entered the churchyard of St Mary’s for their mid-morning refreshments, utilising the steps on the preaching cross as seating whilst enjoying the warm sunshine. The church dates to the th century being mentioned for the first time in  and a few centuries later the tower was added, but most of its medieval traits were lost when it was renovated during the Victorian era..removeThey continued and joined part of the long distance Valeways Millennium Heritage Trail, through fields on the boundary of Cardf Airport making towards Fonmon with its lovely duck pond and stunning weeping willow tree which cascades over the water. Then climbing steps into a small wood leading to muddy fields near Home Farm they eventually exited onto Port Road following it southwards to East Aberthaw.Taking time out they paused at the Blue Anchor for a swt pint outside in the fresh air before following Well Road downhill. This road was previously known as Marshe Way, one would presume because the River Thaw flowed to reach the sea by this route until the Aberthaw Power Station was built and the river was re-routed.Tramping muddy paths below the main Vale railway line through the nature reserve which is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest, they headed through the reed beds beside the western end of the delightful lake, overseen by the ruined Aberthaw Limeworks built in , to arrive at the sea defence wall. Heading out onto the beach they found a suitable place for lunch sitting on a washed up tree trunk beside the dunes and overlooking the Bristol Channel and English coastline before continuing along the salt flats.The beautul refurbished clf steps on part of the Wales Coast Path brought them steeply uphill into Fontygary Leisure Park, which was eerily quiet due to the winter months and reaching Fontygary beach, they continued up steps following the coast path past the old disused limestone quarries to reach the southernmost tip of mainland Wales and Rhoose Point. Onward through Porthkerry Holiday Park and the Iron Age hillfort at the Bulwarks, to slither downhill through the woods back into Porthkerry for the steep climb back up the Golden Stairs in order to make their way along the clftop to Cold Knap, just as the sun was sinking in the western sky.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communitySir Charlie Bean, who was deputy governor for monetary policy throughout the financial crisis and a recently-retired member of the UK’s fiscal watchdog, criticised the Bank’s decision to hold off from raising rates until December.He told the PA news agency that policymakers should have acted in November, or earlier, as the economy showed signs of overheating.But Sir Charlie, who retired from the Office for Budget Responsibilityat the end of last year, said the Bank was powerless to influence energy prices and that the Government needs to step in and help ease the cost of living squeeze.The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committeeincreased the cost of borrowing from .% to .% last month, the first hike for more than three years, as it warned that inflation was set to reach % in the spring.It came after the Bank caught financial markets off guard when it kept rates unchanged in November, despite having laid the foundation for a rise.Sir Charlie said the Bank’s rates stance “has erred too much towards looseness through the course of the past few months”, adding that he was “surprised” by the decision to hold off in November.“If I was on the MPC, I would have been in favour of moving a little bit earlier than they have done,” he said.He said a strong economic bounce-back and resilient jobs market despite the end of the furlough scheme would have supported a rate rise before December, potentially even months earlier.While he said it was not a “signicant policy error” made by the Bank, it would likely mean rate-setters have to “move faster” with further increases as inflation has already soared to its highest level for nearly  years.Official figures earlier this week showed inflation jumped to .% in December, far higher than the Bank expected..removeExperts now predict another rate hike to .% at the Bank’s next meeting in early February, which would mark first time the MPC has made back-to-back increases since June .At least another rise is also expected by the end of the year. vw,vw,px, px\"Sir Charlie Bean warned Omicron may wipe up to % off growth Sir Charlie, also a professor at the London School of Economics, warned the Bank’s action would not be able to prevent an inevitable hit to household finances from rising inflation and the upcoming April increase in National Insurance.The latest data has revealed that wages are already failing to keep up with steep rises in the cost of living.“Living standards for people in this country will be lower,” he said.“It’s certainly going to come as a shock to consumers as we go through the first part of this year.”He said with Bank action taking two to three years to feed through, “it is only the Government through it’s ious fiscal tools that can do anything there”.Sir Charlie also cautioned over a hit to UK economic growth of up to % from the Omicron iant of coronavirus and the restrictions imposed before Christmas.He said the UK may be heading for a contraction in the first quarter as staff shortages have taken their toll and hospitality firms suffer.But with Plan B coronavirus restrictions now ending, he said this impact would quickly “unwind” as growth rebounds..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Bank did not raise interest rates soon enough, says former deputy governor article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I am not very body confident and the thought of putting on a swim suit horried me, and getting changed afterwards as well.”One of the dogs being looked after by Lucys TrustHowever, despite her fears, Geolin decided to be brave and take the plunge. “I wanted to challenge myself and thoughtI was going too do it I wanted to do it properly and learn how too swim in the sea,” she continued. “I looked for an open water swimming coach and Colin Mccard came very highly recommended.“I had my first lesson last April. It was freezing, I got cramp, I was terried, but, I loved it and have been taking open sea swimming lessons ever since. It took weeks too overcome my fears of being out of my depth, and actually learning how to swim, especially putting my face in the water, but it was all possible with the patience of a fantastic coach Colin. I feel ready to swim a distance and hopefully raise as much money as I can for the charity I volunteer at Lucy’s Trust.”Run by Olivia Kenned, who is a veterinary surgeon, and her partner Rob Durston, Lucy’s Trust, which is based near Lisburn, is a sanctuary for dogs who cannot be rehomed due to behavioural issues, or those that are in most need of a rescue place, and or assistance to overcome their dficulties to become happy healthy dogs once again.“This past two years has seen a signicant rise in the number of dogs Lucy’s Trust have been asked to take in with behavioural problems,” explained Geolin. “I am deeply saddened in the knowledge that many of these dogs are being put to sleep, young healthy dogs, who with the right commitment and guidance from their s could have gone on to live happy lives. This is not the fault of our struggling animal rescues, who can only take in the numbers they can actively care for.“Every rescue that I know of has been inundated with dogs in the last year. The current developing situation can only be referred to as a crisis. As a country we are failing our dogs on an unprecedented level, and I are really urging the general public to step up and take responsibility for the dog which they chose to procure. Please contact Lucy’s Trust for behavioural advice and recommendations for local positive reinforcement trainers who will help you to help your dog. Giving them up is not the answer, it is not a solution,”To help Lucy’s Trust continue their work, Geolin is planning to swim m- metres at Helen’s Bay.
