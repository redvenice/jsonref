I offered a million more, but the assets were restrained.’ He added: ‘I’m not worried, I’m not nervous at all.’Stunt, 37, had bragged he would never go bankrupt, but his excuses ran out on Thursday after a string of court hearings. He faced a towering debt pile worth £14million of allegedly unpaid bills. He owed a £1million gambling debt to a spreadbetting firm, and another £3.9million to Christie’s auction house for a Picasso. He was even being chased by his own orce lawyers, who helped negotiate his 2017 split from Miss Ecclestone, 30, for a debt of £247,000.The father of three convinced a series of judges he was on the brink of being able to settle his debts – although he disputed several of the claims – by selling off artworks including a £2.1million Monet. He also said he was prepared to sell a £1.6million work by modernist painter Marc Chagall.But High Court judge Clive Jones threw out Stunt’s application for proceedings to be adjourned and declared him bankrupt.Stunt’s barrister Timothy Higginson said criticism of his client amounted to ‘personal attacks’ and blamed his failure to comply with a previous court ruling on the restraint order. The assets will ultimately remain under the control of the CPS and the courts until the investigation is over. "},{"url":null,"title":"The Queens honour Queen","story":"Share this article   Royal aides rewarded The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s housekeeper has been recognised in the honours.Antonella Fresolone has been awarded a Royal Victorian Medal for her years of service, most recently running William and Kate’s household at Kensington Palace.The Italian, who is unmarried and in her mid-forties, started working for the couple shortly before the birth of their first child, Prince George.The £23,000-a-year position comes with a staff apartment at the palace and Miss Fresolone, with her strong work ethic, was considered a ‘shoo-in’ for the post.Before taking up her current role, she was one of the Queen’s top three housemaids and worked at Buckingham Palace for 13 years.Clive Alderton, principal private secretary to Charles and Camilla – the couple’s most senior advisor – has been made a commander of the order, while Edward Mark Bruton Priday, manager of the Queen’s bank, Coutts \u0026amp Co, has been made a member.  Medal for the Holocaust survivor who met \u0027Dr Death\u0027          Holocaust survivors George Hans Vulkan, Ernest Simon, Walter Kammerling and Ruzena Levy, at the Jewish Museum LondonSentenced to die in the gas chamber by Hitler’s notorious ‘Doctor of Death’, 14-year-old Rachel Levy believed her fate was sealed.But as she and other Jewish children waited at Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944, a guard allowed them to flee.Now 88 and a grandmother living in north London, Mrs Levy and other child survivors have been awarded the British Empire Medal (BEM) in this year’s Queen’s Birthday Honours – in recognition of their work teaching generations of children about the Holocaust.Mrs Levy, who grew up in former Czechoslovakia, said Nazi persecution in her home town began when Jewish children were barred from going to school and their families stopped from running businesses.Her father Solomon and other men were taken to a labour camp in 1941 and never returned. Later, the women and children were forced on trains to be taken to Auschwitz.Her family arrived together. But her two younger sisters, Rivka, ten, and eight-year-old Etta, and her toddler brother Ben-Zvi were too young to work so they were taken to the gas chamber immediately, along with their mother Shlima.Only Rachel and her brother Chaskiel, 16, were spared. She underwent other ‘selections’ – often overseen by Dr Josef Mengele – in which the weakest were picked out to die, as part of the extermination of around six million Jews.         Rachel Levy (back row, third from left), aged 13, with family members including her mother, a brother, two sisters and an aunt, who all diedFinally, he gestured that she too should die. But a delay forced their SS guard to listen to their cries, as they called out: ‘Why can’t you help us?’ Mrs Levy said the female guard gestured for them to run away and she hid among kitchen workers. She and thousands of other inmates were later forced to walk for 21 days from Poland to the concentration camp Bergen-Belsen in Germany in the last months of the war – the so-called ‘Death March’.Once inside Belsen, she was met by unimaginable scenes of horror, as piles of bodies were left to rot. Her aunt died in the camp and Mrs Levy contracted typhoid.Liberation came in April 1945, when British soldiers arrived. Mrs Levy and her brother Chaskiel were reunited and came to Britain.Daughter Shelley, 56, said her mother still suffered nightmares after reliving her experiences but was delighted to learn she would be honoured for her work.BEMs were also awarded to Walter Kammerling, 95, Gabrielle Keenaghan, 92, Ernest Simon, 89, George Hans Vulkan, 89, and Ann and Bob Kirk, 90 and 94, who were all brought to Britain as children to escape Nazi-occupied Europe. Mr Kirk lost 20 members of his family but survived after his parents sent him to Britain from Germany in 1939, when he was 13. His wife Ann said: ‘In our talks, we always make the point that our experiences show the dangers of racial prejudice and that it is essential to treat everybody as human beings, regardless of race and religion.’The Holocaust Educational Trust estimates that those honoured have given powerful accounts to more than 100,000 schoolchildren.Karen Pollock, the trust’s chief executive, said: ‘Against a backdrop of rising anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial and hate, we must ensure that this period of history is taught about and known and that the memory of the past is preserved and shared so that future generations know what happened.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/05/12/14397586-0-image-m-97_1559732909102.jpg","title":"Private pictures Prince Harry Meghan Markles wedding leaked Instagram Twitter","story":"Share this articleMeghan Markle and Prince Harry’s private wedding photos leaked on Instagram after photographer is hacked – The Sun"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/12/05/17/3B118C5900000578-0-image-m-17_1480957531506.jpg","title":"Actress Pauley Perrette says wont return NCIS shes terrified Mark Harmon","story":"Share this article\u0027NCIS\u0027 Mess: How a Dog-Bite Divided Pauley Perette and Mark HarmonMark Harmon\u0027s Dog Attacked Crew Member on \u0027NCIS\u0027 Set | TMZ.com"},{"url":null,"title":"Danish royal family elegant display Queen Margrethe hosts dinner party","story":"                 Guests arrived at the dinner party in lavish evening gowns.

He first wished to cross-examine fellow leadership candidate Esther McVey and Labour\u0027s chief Morris dancer Barry Gardiner. Drugs? No, gov, never touched \u0027em, they both insisted.       Eventually, his attention turned to Mr Gove. For the benefit of the tape, let the record show the suspect at this point shuffled gingerly in his chair. Under the studio lights we saw the Govester\u0027s once auburn locks are now quite grey.Fellow Scotsman Marr decided to delay the fast bowling for a bit, leaving the Bolivian marching powder business for later on. First, a few gentle looseners on his guest\u0027s leadership ambitions.Mr Gove said he was ready to be prime minister. Ready from day one.\u0027I have the experience,\u0027 he said assertively, sounding a bit like an over-eager contestant on The Apprentice.\u0027I have proven in every job I have done against the odds, that I can deliver. I have shown in every opportunity I have had to deliver that I can deliver.\u0027 Stand and deliver!         \u0027I have the experience,\u0027 Mr Gove said assertively, sounding a bit like an over-eager contestant on The Apprentice.If PM, he would seek a renegotiation on Theresa May\u0027s deal with Brussels, led by himself and a smart troupe of officials. Google translate: Hopeless Whitehall Sir Humphrey Olly Robins won\u0027t be anywhere near it.Marr, oddly, kept asking questions about what would happen \u0027under Michael Gove\u0027 as though they were discussing someone else.Finally, we came to the thorny issue of drugs. As Mr Marr began addressing this, his programme\u0027s director went all Sergio Leone, slowly panning in on Mr Gove\u0027s face, hoping, perhaps, to reveal signs of tension.The Gove brow, I should point out, remained bone-dry.       Was it a \u0027habit\u0027, Mr Marr asked of the Govester\u0027s Keef Richards period? \u0027I don\u0027t believe it was,\u0027 he replied matter of factly.Did he deserve to go to prison for his activities? Mr Gove agreed he was fortunate not to have seen the inside of a jail cell. Steady! He hadn\u0027t so much donned a hair shirt as opted for a bit of Opus Dei- style self-laceration.Marr then pursued the suggestion in one Sunday newspaper that Mr Gove\u0027s confession might result in him being banned from travelling to the United States. Of all the off-cuts from this saga, this is surely the most ludicrous. Miguel coolly suggested that if he became prime minister, the idea our closest ally might bar him from entering the country might be slightly fanciful.The hypocrisy charge was Marr\u0027s next tactic. He pointed out that while Mr Gove was education secretary, teachers were suspended if they were caught taking drugs. Is it a case of one law for politicians and another for the rest? \u0027I wouldn\u0027t want to look in to inidual cases,\u0027 said Gove. This is politico speak for \u0027let\u0027s not go there…\u0027We briefly got to hear about Gove\u0027s plan to scrap VAT, a pleasing enough sounding policy, though how often have we heard a Tory pledge to simplify the tax system and yet nothing ever happen?Suddenly, Marr announced it was time roll the credits. Phew! We would be spared the embarrassing dad-rock act which usually ends the show.Mr Gove now awaits the verdict of his supporters. I suspect he\u0027ll escape this mess with a mild caution."},{"url":null,"title":"Virat Kohli tells fans stop booing Steve Smith Cricket World Cup","story":"Share this article Kohli is the first player to make such a statement to a crowd since Smith and David Warner\u0027s returns.The two Australian cricketers have been met with jeers throughout the tournament - from a chilly reception at Bristol to heated tension at Nottingham - over the 2018 ball tampering scandal known as Sandpapergate.  Television cameras had caught cricket player Cameron Bancroft rough up one side of the cricket ball with sandpaper during the third Test-Match against South Africa in Cape Town.Then-captain Smith and former vice-captain Warner were also involved and were slapped with 12-month bans, while Bancroft received a nine-month suspension.

The title translates literally from the Portuguese as “malice”, but it carries too the echoes of the words “city” and “cursed”. Rio Branco grew up the son of a diplomat, citizen of the world and for half a century his camera has given him similar licence. Though earlier work, photo essays for National Geographic for example, focused on very specific communities – the young fighters of the Santa Rosa Boxing Academy in Rio de Janeiro or the prostitutes and street children of Salvador de Bahia – he has come to reject expected labelling of time and place.The photographs in Maldicidade are uncaptioned, drawn from a lifetime of wandering the backstreets of New York, Havana, Barcelona and beyond. Rio Branco looks for those contrasts between grimy decay and daily renewal that are the universal fascination of city life. This picture, of a tray of fresh pastries served under the open bonnet of a beaten-up car, depicts exactly the kind of incongruity that his camera waits for. The colour and sweetness of those cakes contrast with the greys of the car and the street.A film-maker and painter as well as a photographer, Rio Branco has been an associate of Magnum since the 80s, but his work is not in the photojournalistic tradition that the agency is most famous for. By focusing on thematic details, he says he wants to make his pictures transcend documentary and express what he sees as poetic constants: “Time, flesh, sexuality, decay, death.”The cars in his photographs, like this one, crashed or abandoned or rusted or scrapped, tell those stories just as surely as the faces and bodies of the city’s inhabitants.Maldicidade by Miguel Rio Branco is out on 12 June (Taschen, £60)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f98a93716dff43ed28305e74e85cc762372f9da6/97_851_2316_1390/master/2316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3a907ffc9ec67800eb7babafd4523f2","title":"diary drawings daily instagram john hewitt manchester","story":"In June 2013, artist John Hewitt started making daily drawings inspired by his dog-walking encounters, and posting them on Instagram.

Get your hiking boots onIt’s hard to think of another state so richly blessed in the beautiful scenery department, and California seriously rewards travellers who take on its hiking trails. With big-hitter national parks such as Yosemite, Kings Canyon and Sequoia, Joshua Tree and Death Valley all easily drivable from San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, California is an ideal destination for those wanting to mix up a culture-crammed city break with awe-inspiring outdoor adventures.2. Eat the street at an iconic farmers’ marketCalifornia is deservedly proud of its fabulous fresh produce, with a farm-to-table dining scene that makes it the envy of the rest of the world. For Californians, the weekly farmers’ market has become a social institution akin to attending church, so plan to make a meal of visiting the Ferry Building Marketplace in San Francisco or San Luis Obispo’s friendly downtown market. San Diego in particular has made an art form of farmers’ markets, with countless neighbourhood markets popping up across town. If you’ve only got time to do one, make a Sunday pilgrimage to the LGBTQ-friendly, progressive neighbourhood of Hillcrest for their weekly 175-vendor market.3. Be put in your place by big treesSoaring coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) lace the coastline from just south of Big Sur to the Oregon border and beyond. Humboldt Redwoods state park is where you’ll find some of the oldest and tallest, and it’s easily accessed off Highway 101.“Farmers’ markets are a great way to support responsible travelling,” says Flight Centre’s Brown. “It’s pretty easy to do in Cali, as it’s the largest agricultural producer in the US.”4. Sip Chardonnay by the seaCalifornian wine is popular around the planet, but it really does taste better when you’re staring out at the crashing waves of the Pacific. A favourite spot is the clifftop restaurant of Nepenthe in Big Sur, where you can choose from more than 400 local tipples.5. Go vintage shopping in Joshua TreeThe other-worldly landscape of Joshua Tree national park is the area’s main draw, but a cluster of quirky desert communities are well worth lingering in. Close neighbours Pioneertown, Joshua Tree and Yucca Valley are all worth a snoop, and keep a particular eye out for the excellent vintage shopping on offer. Local designers and makers are showcased at Shop on the Mesa, while Hoof \u0026amp the Horn does excellent vintage gear, and The Station is a great spot to linger over a latte after finding some retro treasure. Rise with the birds at the weekend to snaffle bargains at the Sky Village Swap Meet before the sun gets into its stride.6. Cycle the beach path from Santa Monica to VeniceSanta Monica and the neighbouring, more hipster, Venice are LA’s best-loved city beach communities. Grab a Breeze bike and cruise down the coast, past the kitsch pier amusements, skateboarders, beachfront bars and fitness fanatics working out at Muscle Beach.7. Take a taco tour of LAWhat Indian food is to Londoners, Mexican cuisine is to Angelenos. The best taco trucks are found in the traditionally Hiic neighbourhoods of Echo Park and Los Feliz, as well as downtown. Stalk cult taco trucks Guerrilla Tacos and Korean-infused Kogi BBQ on Instagram (@guerillatacos and @kogibbq) to gorge like a local.8. Immerse yourself in San Francisco’s colourful cultureFew cities can claim the cultural clout of San Francisco – synonymous, as it is, with beat poetry, jazz and alternative rock, the 1970s counterculture movement, and LGBTQ voices. For literature lovers, sipping a beer in the Vesuvio Cafe beloved by beat generation writers Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, as well as the likes of Bob Dylan and Dylan Thomas, will send a shiver down your spine. The famous City Lights bookstore is literally next door.“The murals of San Francisco are an Instagrammer’s dream,” says Brown. “The Mission district has the highest concentration of street art of any neighbourhood in the world.”9. Breakfast with the stars in MalibuLA’s Malibu Farm Pier Cafe at the end of the pier is one of the best positioned beach cafes on the planet. If you can tear your eyes away from the sea views, you’ll spot local celebrities sipping Vietnamese coffees and nibbling avocado on toast behind oversized sunglasses.10. Laze by the pool in Palm SpringsA playground for the rich and famous since the Brat Pack made it their home in the 1950s, Palm Springs is a must-visit for lovers of modernist architecture, poolside bars and luxury hotels. In 2019, this desert hideaway continues to offer weary urbanites, solitude-seeking celebrities and LA’s fashion crowd some seriously decadent R\u0026ampR.California dreaming?

But it might never have been published if it wasn’t for the intervention of a mystery author‘I’m a person,” says Tayari Jones, the morning after carrying off the Women’s prize for fiction for her fourth novel, An American Marriage, “who before this had never even won a raffle. Truly. I remember, as a child, you could win a whole summer of ice-cream and I saved and I bought several tickets. I did not win and the little girl who won only had one ticket. How about that? I’ve been holding that grudge for 40 years.”An American Marriage, the story of a black man falsely imprisoned for a violent assault on a woman he glancingly meets in an Atlanta motel, has certainly transformed Jones’s literary fortunes. Crucially, it caught the eye of Oprah Winfrey, who last year selected it for her Book Club – a guarantee of enormously enhanced sales and profile. Then came the moment when the former US president Barack Obama included it on his increasingly celebrated list of summer reading, praising its “moving portrayal of the effects of a wrongful conviction on a young African-American couple”.It’s easy to see what attracted Winfrey and Obama: the novel turns outwards to address the immense and seemingly intractable issues around the incarceration of black men, and at the same time never loses sight of the traumatic effects of injustice on its victims’ most intimate relationships. As its title suggests, it’s concerned not only with Roy, the young man from a working-class Atlanta family keen to grab all the opportunities life offers him, but with his wife, Celestial, an artist from a far more moneyed and socially elevated background. When I remark that two of the writers shortlisted for the Women’s prize, Pat Barker and Madeline Miller, set their stories in ancient Greece, Jones points out that An American Marriage is itself in conversation with The Odyssey, the story of a man trying simply to get home to his wife and of a wife who, left alone to hold the fort, is faced with the dilemma of how far to proceed with her own life.When people question Jones about the minutiae of the crime at the book’s heart, she counters strongly: “I don’t want this to be a story about the police. I don’t want this to be a story about law enforcement. This is not a procedural. This is the story about a family affected by wrongful conviction, about what they owe each other and the ways that they will move forward. I think that when we forget that part of stories, we are actually dismantling community.”Which is not to say that Jones, 48, turns away from the stark political realities the novel is built on she spent a year at Harvard doing research for the book and, even on this short trip to Britain, has found time to visit Brixton prison in south London, home to the inmate-run restaurant The Clink. The decision to write about imprisonment, she says, “wasn’t any big lightning bolt. I feel that the idea of incarceration has always been, in many ways, the boogie man under the bed for black America. There’s a fear, particularly among the middle class, that you’ll do everything right – you’ll go to school, you’ll do this, you’ll do that – and then the system will just come and abduct you. That is the monster under the bed, and I wanted to look under the bed and face it head on.” She says her concern spreads beyond clear miscarriages of justice to encompass the vast numbers of those in jail for non-violent drug offences, or who are mentally ill. “I’m not only interested in the ‘innocent people’ when we make that distinction between innocent and not innocent, we miss the major issues about prison reform.”But while the horror thrown up by her research was stopping her from sleeping, it was not, she tells me, “moving my pen … I felt like I was trying to animate statistics”. (She also recalls being advised to put more overt political content in the novel, “as if I had some Black Lives Matter in my handbag”.) Conscious of the advice that you should write fiction about people and their problems, not problems and their people, she one day found herself in a mall, tuning into a couple’s argument. “I heard the woman say: ‘Roy, you know you wouldn’t have waited on me for seven years.’ And he said: ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about. This wouldn’t have happened to you in the first place.’”Jones grew up in Atlanta, the child of professors – her father is a political scientist and her mother an economist Jones remembers a childhood spent not eating grapes, in support of farm workers in California, and boycotting the products of apartheid South Africa. I ask how close the mall conversation felt to a reality she could recognise. In answer, she recalls an incident from her childhood, at a time when a serial killer was murdering young black boys, crimes that she used as the basis for her first novel, Leaving Atlanta. Two of the 28 murder victims went to her school. One night, her father was driving a family friend home and got lost. When he got back, he was shaken. “He said: ‘I was just driving around those dark streets, I didn’t know where I was going and I didn’t have anyone to vouch for where I had been, and I was so afraid I would be pulled over.’ It was the first time in my life I had seen my father afraid … and I now understand, he was just afraid that being a black man in the wrong place at the wrong time could have ruined his life.”Jones’s UK visit has, of course, coincided with that of another American, Donald Trump. “He’s following me,” she sighs. I ask whether she feels that the great regression sweeping her country – the rise of the far right, the rolling back of the rights of women and of minorities – feels like a threat to the fragile gains of civil rights activists. She points to what feels like an epidemic of the police being summoned to “black people doing ordinary things in ordinary places” she makes sure that when she arrives at a cafe, she orders coffee immediately, to signal that she is a patron rather than a trouble-maker or a vagrant. She has stopped looking at her neighbourhood website to which people upload their video doorbell footage because of the occasions on which neighbours would mark as suspicious the perfectly legitimate comings and goings of black people (including, she tells me, those canvassing for the Democrat politician Stacey Abrams). “I am sometimes appalled,” she says, “at what my neighbours find to be suspicious.” She is preoccupied now with what happens in a post-Trump world. “Let’s say Trump is not re-elected. Let’s say all over the world, these far-right regimes are put down. How will we live with our neighbours, knowing what we now know of them?”Jones now has a platform, but even a few years ago it was looking decidedly precarious. She couldn’t find a publisher for her third novel, and her first two, well-received critically but not huge sellers, had fallen out of print. That third novel, Silver Sparrow, was firmly relegated to a drawer. Invited to a book festival, she went out of obligation, but was feeling embarrassed – as though her lack of success disqualified her from being there. But while she was there, a woman said: “I can help you.”“I didn’t take it very seriously because you meet a lot of unusual people on the road with unusual ideas. But she literally put my hand in the hand of a publisher.” They chatted, and before they said goodbye, the publisher asked her how she knew Judy. Oh, replied Jones, I don’t know anyone called Judy. “‘No,’ she says, ‘I mean Judy Blume, who just introduced us.’ It was like my childhood had rescued me in my hour of need. I turned to thank her, and she had vanished.”At this moment, we turn to order some coffee. On the table is a bouquet given to her at the awards ceremony, which she wants to bring to her publishers’ office so that they can enjoy it too. She is wreathed in smiles. I explain to the waiter that she has just won a prize. Suddenly, two glasses of champagne arrive. It is 11.30 in the morning, but it’s not every day that you pick up a major literary award. “I will if you will,” says Jones.An American Marriage is published by Oneworld (£8.99).

Woodford, one of the UK’s best-known stockpickers, suspended all trading in the fund “until further notice” after being overwhelmed by customer withdrawals following a series of bad market bets.Hill said: “I would like to apologise personally to all clients who have been impacted by the recent problems with the Woodford equity income fund. We all share their disappointment and frustration. Our priority right now is to support our clients and keep them informed.”Woodford said last week the fund would reopen as soon as was “practicable after these exceptional circumstances have ceased”, and that the suspension would be reviewed “at least every 28 days”.Hill said: “The shortcomings of one fund should not detract from the benefits of favourite fund lists like the Wealth 50.”His firm has come under fire from investors who will not be able to access their investments until the suspension is lifted. Investors have also criticised the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, for failing to see the risks taken by Woodford.The former City minister Lord Myners said the FCA “should have been awake” to problems at the fund, telling the BBC that the regulator had missed “clear warning signs” that things were going badly.On Thursday, Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury committee, said investors should not be charged management fees while trading in the fund was suspended.Concerns were raised last year after a series of poor performances by companies part-owned by Woodford funds, many of them not listed on the stock market, making them difficult to sell.Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, defended the regulator and Woodford’s decision to suspend the fund. “The alternative would have been much more disorderly,” Bailey told Bloomberg TV in his first comments since the gates were closed on investors on Wednesday.He offered assurances that the FCA would be watching Woodford closely as the fund manager started to sell off his stakes in privately held companies, which are more difficult to turn into cash. Bailey said it was important for funds like Woodford’s to invest in unlisted firms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd575996ef23eccff0abc6f6fffdbf7531d26f71/0_679_3160_1895/master/3160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67df556644f1077a8e8aaca2002f8c37","title":"the curse of masakado why a malevolent ghost haunts tokyo","story":"The tale of the ‘first samurai’ whose severed head still terrorises Tokyoites today is the story of the city itselfA Tokyo bank once opened an account in the name of a man who had been dead for 1,000 years.The bank was a branch of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (now part of MUFG, the largest bank in Japan), which looked out over a neighbouring lot that contained the grave where the man was buried. The bank employees were reportedly instructed not to open any windows to the man’s grave, nor to turn their backs on it, even when at their desks the account was set up to placate him.The figure? Taira no Masakado, a rebellious warrior who was killed in 940AD but whose spirit has terrorised the region ever since. How Masakado became such a malevolent symbol to ordinary Tokyoites is the story of the city itself, and its centuries of violence, superstition and coincidence.As Japan\u0027s capital enters a year in the spotlight, from the Rugby World up to the 2020 Olympics,  Cities is spending a week reporting live from the largest megacity on Earth. Despite being the world\u0027s riskiest place – with 37 million people vulnerable to tsunami, flooding and due a potentially catastrophic earthquake – it is also one of the most resilient, both in its hi-tech design and its pragmatic social structure. Using manga, photography, film and a group of salarimen rappers, we\u0027ll hear from the locals how they feel about their famously impenetrable city finally embracing its global crownAt the time of Masakado’s death, the region now known as Tokyo was little more than mudflats and plains of high reeds. Japan was ruled from far-away Kyoto – literally “the Capital” – while the Tokyo area was the lawless north, the destination for younger sons, bastards and outcasts who were packed off to the frontier. These borderland warlords called themselves the samurai – “those who serve” – and boasted of their lifelong loyalty to the throne.Mostly. Masakado was the first glimmering of a shift in power away from Kyoto and towards these new warriors. One day, announcing that the Sun Goddess had chosen him, he proclaimed himself emperor, killed a local governor and seized two northern provinces. Shocked by his treachery, the real emperor put a price on his head, which one of Masakado’s cousins soon collected. Dead or alive, however, the damage had been done: Masakado had challenged the sovereign’s ine authority.It wasn’t long before the legends began. He was said to be invulnerable, except for the top of his head, where his mother – a serpent – had failed to lick him. Plagues of butterflies supposedly warned of his revolt as rainbows broke out simultaneously in the capital.The authorities tried to mock him by claiming that he was speared by sword-leaf trees in the afterlife, his liver eternally roasting – but this propaganda only revealed the degree to which he’d rattled them.His daughter, Takiyasha, was said to live on in the ruins of his fortress, dabbling in necromancy and raising an army of frogs. In Japanese, frog (kaeru) is a pun on “return”, a hint that Masakado would come back to seek his revenge.To prevent that, the authorities cut off his head and brought it to Kyoto, where they hung it from a tree in the marketplace. But the severed head howled in the night, and demanded to know where its body was.Eventually, the head flew away. A temple in Gifu marks the spot where a local warrior shot at it with an arrow, and then it was on the move again, eventually coming to rest in an obscure fishing village called Shibazaki. The locals washed it, buried it with full honours and inscribed the gravestone with charms that prevented his escape. But lighting strikes and strange apparitions continued – and whenever bad luck struck the village, it was inevitably blamed on him.Meanwhile, Masakado’s infamy was starting to grow among the rebellious samurai bad boys, who had taken to quoting his scandalous maxim: “The people of this world will always anoint their sovereigns through victory in combat.”Eventually those rebels seized power for themselves through victory in combat, and Masakado was anointed the “first samurai”. His grave, located at the Buddhist Kanda Shrine, was now officially incorporated within the new capital city: the great Edo, now the city of the Shogun.The position of Shogun was never meant to be permanent. It was supposed to be a crisis appointment: a hatchet-man for the emperor during a national emergency. The canny Tokugawa family, however, twisted it into a dynasty, and from the 1600s they became the de facto rulers of Japan for the next 250 years. By 1720 Edo had become the largest city in the world and the true power centre of Japan – with Masakado as its shadowy patron.Japan also deliberately cut itself off from other countries, while Edo became home to the “floating world”, an isolated enclave of artistic pursuits, advanced craft techniques and sometimes seedy nightlife. The popular kabuki theatres were censored from discussing politics, so instead the big-city audiences flocked to lurid tales of ancient vengeful spirits. Masakado (1836) was one of the hits, with his sorceress-daughter retelling his story and fighting off her pursuers with witchcraft.But eventually Masakado’s people were themselves defeated. The samurai started to fade in relevance, and in 1868 a revolution overthrew the Shogun and “restored” the emperor. Edo was renamed To-kyoto (“Eastern Capital”), soon shortened to just Tokyo. Masakado’s grave wound up on the grounds of the new finance ministry.Wary of his influence, in 1874 the new government officially proclaimed him an “enemy of the emperor”, ending his semi-ine status. Then the finance ministry burned to the ground in the 1923 earthquake. Masakado was blamed. Rumours then spread that the replacement building, too, was cursed: accidents, falls and mishaps claimed 14 lives in five years – including that of the finance minister himself.Gingerly, officials confessed that they had bulldozed the grave during construction. After the death of the finance minister, they hastily restored the grave in 1928, and a priest was called in to hold a “pacification ceremony” – because it’s rude to say “exorcism”. They forgot, however, to put back the stone slab carved with spells to hold Masakado in check.That, at least, was the excuse offered in 1940 when nine nearby offices were destroyed in a lightning strike. The stone was put back, only to enter the news again in 1945 when it got the blame for causing a bulldozer to overturn, killing the driver. The US Army Occupation force had planned to turn the area into a car park, but were persuaded after the accident that the best policy was to leave Masakado in peace.The Mitsui Finance Corporation didn’t get the memo. Five decades later, with Japan mired in a two-decade recession, it tried to sell mineral mining rights to Masakado’s land – an act of hubris, perhaps, that signalled the desperation of Japan’s economic crash. As usual, Masakado had the last laugh: the company filed for bankruptcy in 2002. It was during that time that Tokyo-Mitsubishi bank, taking no chances, tried to bribe him in the afterlife by opening an account in his name.Masakado isn’t the only ghost in Tokyo. The victims of lethal experiments at Toyama Park are still reportedly heard, while so-called “stigmatised properties” or haunted houses can be rented for a major discount. Not even the prime minister is immune. Since 2012, Shinzo Abe has refused to move into his official residence in Nagatacho, where one of his predecessors was assassinated.Masakado’s grave is still there today, among the skyscrapers and construction sites near exit C4 of Otemachi station, a little garden with a couple of trees, one last patch of green in the swish business district. It is a small, concrete square, set behind low walls topped with sculpted privet hedges. There, set on a triple-stepped plinth, is a slab of stone carved with ornate cursive Japanese and images of frogs. This is all that is left of Masakado’s resting place, a tiny scrap of the old world, nestled within the cracks of the new.Jonathan Clements is the author of An Armchair Traveller’s History of Tokyo Cities is live in Tokyo for a special week of in-depth reporting.

But on Monday, there is a chance that this could be lifted.Whatever happens, it is clear we need wider resolution on this debate in order to draw a firm line under it. To do so there are two challenges we need to tackle. One is the call of parental rights. The other is the idea of what is “age appropriate”.Speaking as a parent, my rights are important. I know my children better than anyone. I care for them more than anyone. Both my motives and my knowledge mean that I am most likely to know what’s best for them.But my rights are not unlimited. They do not trump all other concerns or viewpoints. No parent in modern society has unlimited rights. We are not free to neglect, abuse or hurt our children, for example. It is not a valid argument simply to claim “parental rights” as if that automatically overrides all other considerations. We have to dig deeper.The boundaries of parental rights are relatively straightforward when it comes to physical or emotional harm. But what about knowledge and values? Do I have a right to determine what my children learn and believe by controlling their access to other viewpoints and sources of information?This is where parental rights reach their limits. Clearly I should protect my children from some harmful views and knowledge – hatred, incitement, radicalisation. Clearly I have a right to teach my values and beliefs to my child – again assuming that I am not teaching hatred or inciting illegal behaviour. But no parent has a right to restrict their children from learning about other safe and legal values and other perspectives on the world. Not restricting knowledge seems to me to be the best criteria for balancing the rights of parents, young people and society as a whole. It is the exposure to multiple perspectives that gives young people the strongest start in life and the ability to make their own choices.There are many sources of knowledge and values for young people, and our schools are one of them. Their duty is to pass on what we as a society believe is true and what we believe is right and so equip young people for life after school in a complex world.What is true and what is right are always contestable, but the place for this contest to work itself out is through our politics, not in front of the gates of schools. Once something has made its way into law or policy, schools should not be targets.I know parents may feel that the weight of the government and authority figures can overwhelm their own teachings. This is an understandable source of fear. Schools should open conversation with parents so this fear can be addressed. But parents should not underestimate their own influence, nor overestimate that of schools.So let’s switch from the abstract to the concrete. As a society we have decided, through democratic procedures and enshrinement in law, that everyone is equally valued whatever their sexuality or gender identity. That there is no single recipe for a happy family and that we celebrate all loving homes. Schools therefore have a duty to highlight ersity in families. Parents can offer an alternative belief but they do not have the right to restrict their children from hearing what schools have to say. This is not “brainwashing”. Young people are being exposed to multiple viewpoints. Teaching such things doesn’t change who they are – it just helps them feel more confident and proud of who they are. There is no inappropriate age to learn about these things – they do not fall into the domain of dangerous knowledge.LGBT rights are not something that inidual headteachers are pursuing on a whim or as a personal agenda. They are public servants reflecting the choices of government. For many teachers right now doing their job isn’t easy. It would really help if the government could move away from the language of headteachers’ “discretion” on this topic and if we took more seriously the idea of a national curriculum, applied to all schools whatever their status. Teachers and school leaders are exposed and vulnerable the government is powerful. It should stop asking teachers to do the difficult work for it and use its power for good.• Russell Hobby is head of the teacher-training organisation Teach First and a former general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e693f85bca3afd3ed3a1431529568fa673b3dbc/0_44_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bba2bcadff8cc4c4c620fa657857637","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of sunny","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘sunny’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘sunny’.Share your photos of what sunny means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 12 June at 10am.

If that didn’t rule out a large enough section of society, married women were also barred from selection – on the grounds that it would not be appropriate for them to be away from home for a six-month tour.The youthful team – all were under 25 – set off for Australia with a squad of seven teachers or future teachers, two secretaries, an art student, a lawyer, a nurse, and three “ladies of leisure” – plus Myrtle Maclagan, who was employed by the army.Having agreed to not smoke, drink, gamble or find themselves “accompanied by a man”, England’s players were also far more prepared than their Australian counterparts, who only began searching for players 28 days before the first Test was due to begin.Unsurprisingly, England romped to victory. All-rounder Maclagan sent down a searing spell to earn figures of 7-10 and rattle out Australia for 47 in the first innings – picking up the first five-wicket haul in a women’s international in the process.Maclagan followed that up with another impressive milestone, hitting 72 of the visitors’ first-innings score of 154. Though the home side were more resilient with the bat at the second time of asking, England comfortably knocked off the required 32 runs to secure a nine-wicket win.The second Test at the historic Sydney Cricket Ground followed much the same pattern. Maclagan’s century in England’s first innings was the highlight of a match that saw the visitors requiring just 10 runs in the second innings.Although this eight-wicket victory sealed the series, there was no trophy for England captain Betty Archdale to raise in triumph – the WCA’s founding constitution, set out in 1930, proclaimed that “no member of any affiliated club shall take part in any cricket challenge cup or prize competition”.England retained the Ashes on home soil in 1937 after a drawn series and the second world war put paid to the scheduled 1939-40 Ashes it wasn’t until the winter of 1948-49 that England’s players set out for Australia once more. This time around, the hosts were much better prepared. The team were fitter and more skilful, and the crowd of 17,025 across three days in Adelaide – still the highest for a women’s Test in Australia – cheered on a comprehensive 186-run victory, which gave the Australians a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Australian all-rounder Betty Wilson – who turned down three marriage proposals during the  of her international career in order to continue playing cricket – was the undoubted star of the Test. Her brilliant knock of 111 – ended by run-out – was followed by a six-wicket haul, then 3-39 in the second innings.Although the following Tests were more competitive, two draws earned Australia’s women their maiden Ashes series victory. Scoring 268 runs and picking up an impressive 16 wickets across the three matches, Wilson stood head and shoulders above the rest of the players. But still no trophy.It took 34 more Tests and more than 64 years for England and Australia’s women to have something to fight over. In 1998, a miniature bat was burned in a wok in the Harris Garden at Lord’s on July 20, and the ashes were placed in a small wooden trophy.Also in the wok was a copy of the WCA constitution and rulebook – the WCA was finished, having voted to merge with the newly formed England and Wales Cricket Board, and it seemed only right that its “no prize” rule go up in smoke.England were unable to break Australia’s dominance at that stage, however, and the Southern Stars retained the Ashes until 2005 (which some will remember as a good year for the men too).In 2013, the Ashes changed from being Test-only to consist of one Test, three one-day internationals and three T20 Internationals. Six points were awarded for a Test win, or two points for a draw, with two points awarded for a limited-over win and one for a draw.Although the Test match in 2013 was drawn, England triumphed in two ODIs and three T20s to win the home series 12-4 and reclaim the Ashes. A second – but closer – series win followed in Australia, less than six months later, before the format was tweaked in 2015 to reduce a Test win to four points Australia have won then retained the Ashes since.While so much of women’s sport struggles to emerge from the shadows of the men’s game, or strives to emulate it, the Women’s Ashes has always forged its own path, with four-day Tests – an option often discussed for the men’s game – and now an exciting multi-format competition that has opened up new audiences.But it would be nothing without the players, and these days those players come from all walks of life. Cricket Charity Chance to Shine has introduced 4 million state school children to the game since 2005, 2 million of whom are girls, and NatWest has partnered with the charity to ensure this important work continues.

Our education experts reveal how to lift the veil and find out what life is like at each university“Choosing your course at university is a bit like choosing your life partner,” says Mary Curnock Cook. “You need to be in love with it first.“If you’re not getting that flutter of excitement when you read the course details and the module options, then you could be in for three years of hard labour. If you get it right, your degree and the university experience will genuinely be part of your future.”There is no shortage of information out there for students thinking of going to university. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. The biggest problem is the sheer volume of stuff to read and the number of experts to consult. But out of all the voices, the column inches written, the glossy prospectuses and burgeoning websites, Cook is one of those worth listening to.Now an independent educationalist, she worked for seven years as chief executive of the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, Ucas, which oversees applications to British universities. Millions of applications went through on her watch between 2010 and 2017, a period of enormous change and expansion in higher education. Her expert view is that enthusiasm for a subject and attention to the detail of the course are paramount.Mike Nicholson, director of undergraduate admissions and outreach at Bath University, believes the course is more important than which university you go to. He urges students to find out exactly what a course involves and how it’s assessed. “Not all history degrees are the same,” says Nicholson. “Does it cover the sort of things you are interested in? How much contact time does the course involve – how many lectures, seminars and tutorials can you expect each week? What’s the workload like and who will teach you? And how is your own work going to be judged?“A lot of students make assumptions that a degree will be just like school, with the same sorts of assessment,” he says.But this varies hugely, from three-hour end-of-year exams, to continuous assessment through the year, group work and projects. “Lots of that information is available on university websites, but if you can’t find the answer, email the admissions department to find out,” adds Nicholson.He also urges students to look at employment outcomes for graduates who have studied a particular course. If you want to be a journalist, ask universities how many graduates from that particular course now have jobs in the media.“Universities are getting more open with the information they provide,” he says. Prospective students who ask lots of questions are seen favourably. “They show all the signs of being active and engaged.”If you look at the  subject tables, you’ll find a column for “career after six months”. This tells you what percentage of students have graduate-level jobs (or have gone on to further study) six months after graduation.Everyone the  talked to for this article, including former students, university admissions officers and sixth-form careers advisers, urged all students to visit on open days if they possibly can. Go twice if you can afford to.If you miss the open day, arrange an alternative date – universities are desperate to recruit and will be happy to accommodate you. Talk to as many people as possible – students and staff – and spend time on campus and in town to get a sense of a place and whether you might fit in.“Don’t discount gut instinct,” one career development expert says. “When making your decisions, feeling that you can ‘see yourself somewhere’ after a visit is a powerful driver.”Catherine Webster, a careers and HE adviser at Hereford sixth-form college, agrees. “A lot of students think they can work out what they want to do just by looking at words and pictures. It’s only when they get to a place and get a feel for it, that they can decide what’s right for them.”Webster concurs that subject and course are far more important than place. “Fundamentally, it’s most important for them to decide what they want to study rather than where. Establish what they’re interested in and good at, then look at which places do that well. It’s all about research really. It’s using reliable resources and being prepared to do some serious homework.”She recommends starting early: year 10 or 11. Others suggest even before that – when pupils are making GCSE choices in year 9. “The sooner you start to explore these ideas, the more confident you’ll feel later.”But Webster understands that some young people can feel overwhelmed and just aren’t ready to decide. “I feel sorry for students who don’t know what they want to do. They are carried along on a wave of presumptions: ‘You’re doing A-levels so therefore you must be going to university.’ We have to cut them a bit of slack. A reasonable proportion just aren’t ready to make that decision. They should not feel pressurised. You can take a gap year, as long as it’s productive.”If you like the look of a course and a university, Nicholson suggests you look into optional extras on offer, like internships and placements. At Bath, every degree course offers students the opportunity to do placements in the UK or abroad. He says it’s worth drilling down to find out what exactly is on offer – is the university saying it’s happy for you to organise your own placement, or will staff actively help you find a placement? “It’s a big decision, so students should be using this time to do as much research as possible.”If you have a disability or special education need, discuss it with the university. You need reassurance that you’ll get the support you require so you can make your choice without any concerns on that front. “It’s worth starting a conversation early on with a university – before you apply – if there are health issues or mitigating circumstances,” Nicholson advises.Mental health support is another big issue. Though the higher education sector has woken up to the crisis in its midst, there is variability in the quality and quantity of support and counselling available.Use open days to ask about support services and how to access them, urges Dr Ruth Caleb, former head of counselling at Brunel University and an expert on student mental health. Can students make direct contact with counselling services themselves, or is there a triage system, where students’ needs are assessed according to urgency? Are the triage teams professionally qualified?Another good question is whether there is a personal tutor system. How many students are assigned to each tutor, and how often can you see your tutor? “Tutors are often a first point of call for students who are struggling,” says Caleb. Caleb is particularly concerned about the state of mind of students who experience disappointment on results day and fail to get into their university of choice, then make a quick decision to go somewhere entirely different through the clearing system. “Students are most successful in a place where they are happy. I suggest all universities look after their clearing students and make sure they are happy to be there,” she says.There are dozens of questions to consider: campus v city, cost of accommodation, night life, societies, facilities, cost of gym membership, travel costs to and from home, work opportunities if you need to support your own learning.But let’s end with another nugget of wisdom from former Ucas chief, Mary Curnock Cook, and it’s a message to parents.“I don’t want to upset mum and dad,” she says, “but please remember, this is your child’s future, not your past. Support your son or daughter in a way that makes them feel empowered to make this big decision without worrying whether the parents might approve.”In other words – parents, back off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba6701a0f002af410b8ad5c378d2fde2ed835a68/0_328_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd089b97b4e86ee853e740bb0a2309a1","title":"energy firms buy electricity from household rooftop solar panels","story":"Britain’s biggest energy companies will have to buy renewable energy from their own customers under new laws to be introduced this week.Homeowners who install new rooftop solar panels from 1 January 2020 will be able to lower their bills by selling the energy they do not need to their supplier.A record was set at noon on a Friday in May 2017, when solar energy supplied around a quarter of the UK’s electricity. However, solar panel owners are not always at home on sunny days to reap the benefit. The new rules will allow them to make money if they generate electricity for the grid.Labour accused the government last week of “actively dismantling” the solar industry. The sector will still struggle this summer as the change does not come in for another seven months, so homeowners have no incentive to buy panels this year.Chris Skidmore, the minister for energy and clean growth, said the government wanted to increase the number of small-scale generators without adding the cost of subsidies to energy bills. “The future of energy is local and the new smart export guarantee will ensure households that choose to become green energy generators will be guaranteed a payment for electricity supplied to the grid,” he said. The government also hopes to encourage homes with solar panels to install batteries.Greg Jackson, the founder of Octopus Energy, said: “These smart export tariffs are game-changing when it comes to harnessing the power of citizens to tackle climate change”.A few suppliers, including Octopus, already offer to buy solar power from their customers.“They mean homes and businesses can be paid for producing clean electricity just like traditional generators, replacing old dirty power stations and pumping more renewable energy into the grid. This will help bring down prices for everyone as we use cheaper power generated locally by our neighbours,” Jackson said.Léonie Greene, a director at the Solar Trade Association, said it was “vital” that even “very small players” were paid a fair price. “We will be watching the market like a hawk to see if competitive offers come forward that properly value the power that smart solar homes can contribute to the decarbonising electricity grid,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ebada13150cdab83b393492b2e25c17d79cec45/0_23_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f76458485dbf5a63311c32a720e42bd4","title":"greenpeace activists board bp oil rig as it is towed out to sea","story":"Protesters scale 27,000-tonne rig as it leaves Cromarty Firth to demand end to drilling new wells Environmental campaigners have boarded an oil rig in the north of Scotland as it was being towed out to sea and are staging a protest on board.Greenpeace activists say they scaled the 27,000-tonne rig – thought to be operated by BP – as it attempted to leave Cromarty Firth. The protesters are calling for BP to end the drilling for new oil wells and say they are prepared to stay onboard the rig for days.At approximately 6.30pm on Sunday evening, campaigners in a boat pulled up alongside the rig near Inverness, climbed aboard and unveiled a banner declaring a climate emergency.Currently occupying a gantry on a leg of the rig below the main deck, the activists want to stop the drilling rig reaching the Vorlich oilfield, where it is believed to be trying to extract up to 30m barrels of oil.Jo, a Greenpeace activist from Scotland who is aboard the rig, said: “Warm words flow from BP on their commitment to tackling climate change, yet this rig – and the 30m barrels it seeks to drill – are a sure sign that BP are committed to business as usual, fuelling a climate emergency that threatens millions of lives and the future of the living world. We can’t let that happen – that’s why we’re here today.“The government may be bent on draining the North Sea of every last drop of oil, but this clearly contradicts their climate commitments. The perverse idea we must maximise our oil and gas reserves cannot continue.“That means the government must seriously reform the Oil and Gas Authority and instead invest heavily in the crucial work of helping oil communities like those in Scotland move from fossil fuels to the industries that will power our low carbon future.”Responding to the protest, a spokeswoman for BP said: “In all operations safety is our top priority. While we recognise the right for peaceful protest, the actions of this group are irresponsible and may put themselves and others unnecessarily at risk.“We are working with Transocean – the rig’s owner and operator – and the authorities to assess the situation and resolve it peacefully and safely.“We share the protesters’ concerns about the climate. We support the Paris agreement. And we are working every day to advance the world’s transition to a low-carbon future.” Police Scotland said they were aware of an ongoing incident, but that the situation was currently within the jurisdiction of Cromarty Firth’s Port Authority. A spokesman for the Port Authority said he was unable to comment at this stage.

You just wasted $21.50 for a picture.’”After a work conference in Vermont on Friday, Jessop rented a car and made her way to Fox’s Lobster House in York, Maine. Having bought her lobster roll, she walked to the water to take the perfect picture.“It was the most picturesque place,” she said. “You’re standing on the seashore overlooking the lighthouse. I don’t really take a lot of food pictures, but I knew this needed to be documented.”She spent about 20 seconds framing her shot, so she could capture the sandwich and the Nubble Lighthouse in the background. As she took the picture, she said, she felt something rustle in her hand. She thought she had dropped the lobster roll.“That’s when I realized the seagull had swooped in and I hadn’t even seen it coming,” she said. “It’s a really smart bird and it all happened so fast.”As she walked back to the lobster shack, she flipped through her camera roll and burst into laughter, realizing the only photo she had was the exact moment the seagull swooped. She posted the picture on Twitter, saying: “This is why we can’t have nice things.” Within a half an hour, thousands of people had liked the post.Jessop went back to Fox’s and paid for another roll, but this time sat in a different area to enjoy what she said was “an awesome treat and well worth the money”. She asked another customer to take a photo so she had proof she had actually eaten a lobster roll.Jessop said the experience has shown her “people just need a laugh”. She is also embracing the possibility of being known for the rest of her life as the seagull picture woman.“There’s a lot worse things I could be known for,” she said, “and if that means I get free lobster rolls and bring a little bit of laughter into people’s lives, I think that’s a good thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac9e47da54e2f5310435e703d014c78857de565f/0_265_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3dc3db79708dfe7d8b56a87f84bdb9d","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"White tiger cubs, urban deer and many millions of ladybirds"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f1d966da41f4f6689279807d9e90a6dc366c36f/0_2570_4716_2827/master/4716.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fc5fea23df6eef5637ef54e50c94e44","title":"nigel slater asparagus pakora and strawberry ricotta puffs recipes","story":"A simple summer feast that’s fit for a princessI remember being a waiter in a restaurant when Princess Margaret came to dinner – a very late after-theatre supper for 25. The guests came dressed in bow ties and long dresses, and sat down not to a feast but to a single course: just six fat spears of asparagus on a large, white plate with hollandaise sauce. They ate, washed their hands in the silver finger bowls then got up and left. I had yet to eat asparagus and remember thinking how special these long green spears must be if they were the only thing a princess had for dinner.The charms of that vegetable have never dimmed. Asparagus is still special, luxurious and somehow magical. It is one of the delights of early summer and, like the first strawberries, we must be quick if we are to make the most of it.Strawberries are a joy eaten unadorned, but we can have fun with them, too, as I did this week, stuffing them into plump choux buns.I never tire of asparagus, but I do use it more liberally as the season draws to a close. Those early-season spears get little more than a silk coat of hollandaise but, later, they turn up in tarts and salads. The thin, young spears are perfect tempura material, taking very little time to cook. Fatter stems need more time, so a thicker pakora-style batter made with chickpea flour is well suited.gram flour 150gground hot chilli 1 tspground turmeric 1 tspground coriander 1 tspwater 150mlasparagus 150goil for deep fryingFor the raita:lime 1, ripe and turning yellowavocado 1natural yogurt 200gginger 30ggroundnut oil 1 tbspyellow mustard seeds 1 tspnigella seeds 1 tspMake the batter: put the gram flour into a medium-sized bowl, then add the ground chilli, turmeric and coriander and mix together thoroughly. Pour in the water, beating out any lumps with a small whisk, then set aside to rest.Trim the asparagus, discarding the ends of the stalks, and cut the spears into short lengths.Make the raita grate the zest from the lime and put most of it in a small mixing bowl, reserving a little for later. Take care not to include any of the bitter white pith. Cut the lime in half and squeeze the juice into the bowl. Halve, stone and peel the avocado, roughly chop the flesh, then crush into the lime juice using a fork. Stir the yogurt into the avocado.Peel the ginger and grate it, using a very fine-toothed grater, producing a thick, ivory-coloured purée. Stir most of it into the yogurt, setting a little aside for later. Warm the groundnut oil in a shallow pan over a moderate heat. Add the mustard and nigella seeds and warm until fragrant and the mustard seeds turn a slightly darker shade. Spoon the seeds and oil over the surface of the raita, then sprinkle over the reserved lime zest and ginger.Get the deep-frying oil hot, bringing it slowly to 180C on a cooking thermometer. Stir the batter a couple of times then add the asparagus, coating each piece thoroughly. When the oil is up to temperature, lift the pieces of asparagus with a pair of kitchen tongs and lower carefully into the hot oil. They should sizzle immediately.Let the asparagus cook for 4 or 5 minutes, turning as necessary, until the batter is pale gold. Lift each one out with a draining spoon or tongs, and place on kitchen paper for a few seconds before piling on to a serving dish. Bring to the table with the raita.At cookery school in Paris we filled crisp choux balls with strawberry sorbet. Once the buns were risen, we took them from the oven, cut them open and returned them to the heat to dry out. Woe betide anyone with a soggy centre.For the buns:water 125mlbutter 50gstrong white flour 75gsalt a pinchegg 2, beatenbeaten egg a little, for glazingFor the pistachio sugar:caster sugar 40gshelled pistachios 30gmint leaves 16For the filling:raspberries 100gstrawberries 200gdouble cream 150mlricotta 100gSet the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment.For the buns, pour the water into a pan, add the butter and let it melt. Add the flour and salt. Stir with a wooden spoon to a thick paste, then remove from the heat. Transfer to the bowl of a food mixer and add the 2 beaten eggs, a little at a time, beating fast with a flat paddle attachment. When you have a thick, creamy dough, ide into 4, placing it in spoonfuls on the baking sheet, leaving plenty of space between. Brush gently with a little beaten egg then bake for about 25 minutes until crisp and puffed up. Slice each bun open to let the steam out then return to the oven for 5 minutes. Cool the buns on a wire cooling rack.To make the pistachio sugar, put all the ingredients into the bowl of a food processor and process to a fragrant, bright green sugar and set aside.For the filling, blitz the raspberries in a food processor then push through a sieve to extract the seeds. Thinly slice the strawberries then toss them in the raspberry purée. Lightly whip the cream and fold gently into the ricotta, then stir in half the pistachio sugar.Open each bun and fill with some of the ricotta, then the fruit.

He hugged his teammates. He even embraced the referee. Two arms raised to the skies, but nothing too elaborate. Ronaldo did not even mark the occasion by peeling off his top to remind us of the contours of his six-pack. Which was highly unlike him but a reflection, perhaps, that the Nations League is not quite up there with some of his other achievements.At the same time, Ronaldo and his team could still reflect on another highly satisfying achievement to win the inaugural competition following Portugal’s success at Euro 2016. They still had a lot of fun celebrating the latest triumph. Ronaldo was the man to lift the new trophy, sealed with a kiss. Gonçalo Guedes, a 22-year-old Valencia attacker, scored the decisive goal and, yet again, it was difficult not to marvel at the country’s ability to produce gifted footballers.Ronaldo, the greatest of them all, did not even have to reach his most exhilarating heights but, ultimately, all that conjecture about whether he could be the first man to dribble past Virgil van Dijk in the past season felt like a sub-plot to the real story. That was a deserved Portugal victory on a night when the Seleçao might also have shown they are not always reliant on their five-time Ballon d’Or winner.Bernardo Silva certainly deserved his award as the outstanding player of these finals, having displayed the kind of soft-touch brilliance that made him such a prodigious performer in Manchester City’s successful title defence. Rafa Silva, one of Portugal’s substitutes, lit up the night once he entered the game and the official man-of-the-match award went to Rúben Dias, who was part of a defence that restricted the Netherlands to only a couple of opportunities. Ronald Koeman’s team found it difficult to get any real momentum and, crucially, their opponents were not as accident-prone as England’s defenders had been in Guimãraes on Thursday.All of which must have made it a slightly strange evening for the hundreds, potentially thousands, of England supporters who were among the Estádio do Dragão crowd, having bought tickets in advance in the hope their team might be involved. Those supporters were determined to be heard – “shall we sing for you” being their way of introduction – and some clearly felt it was the kind of occasion that warranted booing Van Dijk, in common with Thursday’s game. At least there was no dissent during the Dutch national anthem this time. Or failed MEP candidates punching anyone from behind. It was much more what Uefa would have wanted – a decent match and a happy crowd, culminating with Ronaldo lifting the trophy amid fireworks and silver tickertape.To begin with the different sets of supporters – all three of them – did not have a great deal to get excited about. Indeed the first Mexican wave started before the half-hour mark and it is never promising when the crowd has to make its own entertainment, especially that early into a match.After that, however, Portugal took control, Bernardo Silva came alive and, slowly but surely, the Portuguese in the crowd started to make themselves heard above their English counterparts. Ronaldo’s nutmeg on Frenkie de Jong felt like the football equivalent of patting his opponent on the head, missing only the famous CR7 wink, and Guedes always looked eager to justify his selection ahead of João Félix, the 19-year-old Benfica forward who might be attracting the attention of Europe’s elite clubs but had to settle for a place on the bench.Koeman did make attacking substitutions by bringing on Quincy Promes, Donny van de Beek and Luuk de Jong during different stages of the second half. The problem for the Dutch was that, within seconds of Van de Beek’s arrival, Bernardo Silva had linked up with Guedes for the key moment of the night.Bernardo Silva, as always, was acutely aware of the players around him. A more selfish player might have tried a shot once he had advanced into the penalty area. He shaped as if that was his intention, too. But it was a deception and instead he played a reverse pass into the path of Guedes, who was following up in a more central position. Guedes had Ronaldo to his right but decided to have a go himself and struck the ball powerfully enough for it to find the bottom corner of the net even though the goalkeeper, Jasper Cillesen, reached the shot.One of the disappointments for Koeman was that, even then, his side could not apply concerted pressure. There were a couple of chances for an equaliser, most notably Memphis Depay with a header that was saved by Rui Patrício, but the late onslaught that might have been expected never materialised. Ronaldo soon had his hands on the trophy, with Portugal the first name to be engraved in its silver."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acb9382721932a6a04c4acbab7e7a1f3939222b5/0_63_3408_2045/master/3408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2126245f90d204ee9902450b6ac2b81d","title":"switzerland england nations league third place playoff match report","story":"On the face of it, this should have been cause for celebration. England have finished third at a major finals for the first time since the 1968 European Championships even if, for context, that was a tournament won by Italy who had claimed their semi-final on the toss of a coin and this, in truth, is an inaugural four-team jamboree crowbarred on to the end of a slog of a season.Then there is the national team’s new-found confidence at penalties, their conviction personified by Jordan Pickford first thumping his team’s fifth spot-kick beyond Yann Sommer – “It was a decent pen, wasn’t it?” he offered through a post-match grin –then saving Switzerland’s sixth, spat to his right by Josip Drmic. No England goalkeeper had ever previously taken a penalty in a competitive shoot-out and, even if tension had long since drained from the afternoon, here was the hero from the Spartak stadium last summer outdoing himself by excelling at both aspects of the drill.Having seen previous England teams succumb in their previous five attempts at what was once considered an unscientific lottery, Gareth Southgate’s side have now prevailed in successive shootouts. That is quite a turnaround. And yet, from the near disdain with which the manager and his players treated the bronze medals awaiting them back in the dressing-room – some were apparently unaware there had even been a medal on offer, and did not seem particularly keen to root them out once informed – to the constant reminders that all this was not enough, they departed for home on Sunday night frustrated.Progress has been made in the last year, but the Nations League was supposed to yield a first trophy. That thirst has not been quenched. Southgate admitted the days since the semi-final lost to the Netherlands had been difficult, the sense of deflation palpable. “They took some lifting, but the significant step we’ve taken is the level of disappointment that we leave here having not got to the final or won the trophy,” he said. “We played fine on Thursday but made ridiculous mistakes. It was important we responded with a high level of performance.”They duly outplayed the Swiss here, only for profligacy to undermine their display. Thankfully, they were far more ruthless from the penalty spot than from open play.This game should have been settled by half-time in normal time, so dominant had Southgate’s side been. Four times the woodwork had been left quivering and, inevitably given events late on against the Dutch, there would be a reversal of a goal award from a VAR to endure before the end. Encouragement was to be gleaned from the slick approach play, invariably stemming from Pickford’s short delivery to Eric Dier or one of his centre-halves as a springboard for a foray upfield.John Stones spent all afternoon looking on from the bench, with England as composed here against unambitious opposition as they had been panicked against the more feverish Dutch press. Joe Gomez, utterly unflappable, and Harry Maguire coped far more comfortably this time round.Trent Alexander-Arnold excelled down either flank, his delivery vicious to bypass the Swiss backline, to serve notice of his talent as England’s right-back for the foreseeable future. Yet, for all the collective’s interchanges and energy, incisive passes and clever runs, there was no goal to celebrate.Harry Kane, bursting beyond Manuel Akanji before conjuring a sublime first-time chip from an unkind angle, had struck the face of the crossbar within 100 seconds of the start. Raheem Sterling would smack a free-kick against the woodwork at the other end 115 minutes later. In between, the Manchester City winger scuffed a fine chance straight at Sommer, watched Dele Alli denied by the goalkeeper and head another fine chance over the bar, and saw Fabian Schär ert Danny Rose’s cross inadvertently on to his own post.When England did eventually force the ball home, the substitute Callum Wilson shovelling the rebound into the net after Dele had looped another header on to Sommer’s bar six minutes from the end of normal time, the VAR penalised the Bournemouth striker for a shove on Akanji in the buildup.That effectively condemned all those present to endure the additional half-hour, not least with the Swiss – one battered Granit Xhaka attempt aside – utterly becalmed with minds drifting to summer holidays. Pickford kept that shot out, and enjoyed his moment in the dregs of the campaign.His penalty had been dispatched with glee. “I’d never taken one before, other than a few back in my school days,” said the goalkeeper, who would have taken England’s seventh attempt against Colombia last summer had it been required. “So it was a bit more nerve-racking. But I’ve practised a lot in training in the last three weeks, relaxed, went through my routine, and stepped up. I trusted my ability and my ball-striking.” His punch of the air was a highlight of the afternoon, though England would have preferred something far more tangible to celebrate from their six-day stint in Portugal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e0baaf1101fe87f754481b744408189d25449a2/0_154_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=757f51e138fa9b9b0eeb38e5120dea62","title":"lucy bronze nikita parris england scotland world cup","story":"Parris will join the Ballon d’Or nominee Bronze at Lyon next season and the England pair showed exactly why they have been signed by Europe’s leading clubThere was an all too familiar ruthlessness with which Lucy Bronze and Nikita Parris, who will both be playing for Lyon from next season, attacked the part-time care worker and Scotland left-back Nicola Docherty. That same efficiency was on display at the Parc des Princes on Friday in a France team built around the treble‑winning stars of that Lyon side – but it can almost look cruel.There is only one setting for any player at the six-times European champions: they play turned up all the way to 11 and then some – a testament to the elite professional environment they foster that is unmatched anywhere in the world in the women’s game. Thus it was fitting that the Lyon-bound Parris should be the player linking so resolutely with Bronze – who has been at the French club since 2017 – on England’s right.“We have a connection that I haven’t had with any other full-back. She made my time at Manchester City special and hopefully will make my time at Lyon special. She’s a great player, even more so for England. We have a great relationship,” said Parris who dispatched her penalty with the kind of coolness that will fit in well at the Groupama Stadium, as will the taunting celebrations that followed.“The atmosphere’s there to intimidate you,” said Parris. “But I try to soak it all in, because the more atmosphere I get in my body the more passionate I am about putting the ball in the back of the net.”This was Parris’s first World Cup match. In 2015 she was on holiday in Egypt. “I’m not going to lie to you, I sat in my hotel room and had butterflies. It was the first time. I hadn’t experienced a moment like that. But ultimately I stuck with myself and thought – what two things can you bring to the game today? That’s passion, and drive, and all the rest came for me.”For Docherty, the constant threat will have been exhausting. With Manchester City’s set-piece specialist Caroline Weir drifting inside a little too often and leaving the full-back to deal with Parris’s terrier-like runs and Bronze’s power, essentially alone, there was just no let-up.It was telling that after the break Weir hugged closer to her touchline in an attempt to help stem the tidal wave on the right wing, the view from up high – really high – in the press box clearly matching the one in Shelley Kerr’s technical area. Just 10 minutes after the restart Docherty’s tired legs were hooked in favour of Manchester United’s Kirsty Smith. The exhausted full-back was removed shortly after receiving a yellow card for clattering into Parris, sort of inevitable given the circumstances, to avoid any possibility of a reduction in their numbers.When Millie Bright was taken off for treatment on a shoulder injury, it was Bronze who fell back and helped marshal a temporary back three, the right-back pulling Parris backwards and alongside her. As if connected by a rope they moved in unison, a sight to delight any watching and expectant Lyon fans.It was only a temporary relocation. With Abbie McManus on for Bright, Bronze renewed her right-sided shift at a time when Smith and Lisa Evans began to provide a slightly tougher test.This, though, is Lyon’s finest and they were not to be moved. There was a rare lapse of concentration from Bronze that had let Smith slip past her but it only upped the full-back’s energy levels. Within minutes she was pushing boldly into the back of Evans, not allowing the Arsenal forward any room to turn or get the ball out of her feet. Whether it be a powerful leg stretched to keep a ball in play or a gut-busting run to force a corner that many others would leave, Bronze demonstrated exactly why she was a Ballon d’Or nominee.After Claire Emslie’s 78th-minute goal reduced the deficit for Scotland it was Bronze, who had been entirely blameless for the concession, who held on to the ball as Erin Cuthbert was desperately trying to get it back to get the game restarted at 2-1 to England, screaming “it’s our ball” at the referee before she slowly sidled to the middle.As the clock ticked down it was Bronze who fell to the ground in the centre circle or worked the ball out wide to the corner and held on for as long as possible. Lyon are the masters of the psychological game and there would be no pandering to the Scots’ haste here.Moments later she was on hand to throw herself between the ever potent Cuthbert and guide the ball into the onrushing arms of her goalkeeper, Karen Bardsley.England held on and what is perhaps scary is that neither Bronze nor Parris was at her clinical best. Left-backs beware."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3246e48ec4a34fbf03a80a7e174cbc80e320057f/730_507_5719_3431/master/5719.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=202ea27637ff9d4a1fc4b0dbe02ba067","title":"project scarlett microsoft announces details of new xbox games console","story":"The next-generation Xbox video game console will debut late next year, as announced at Microsoft’s E3 2019 press conference.At a press conference at E3 2019 in LA on Sunday, Microsoft announced the first details of a next-generation Xbox, the follow-up to its Xbox One console. Still known by its codename Project Scarlett, the new machine will be released in late 2020, with Halo Infinite as its leading launch title.Promising to “set a new bar for console power, speed and performance”, the new machine will feature custom hardware designed by chip manufacturer AMD, which supplied the technology for both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and is also behind the architecture of Sony’s as-yet-unnamed next PlayStation.Project Scarlett will be built around AMD’s latest Zen 2 processing unit, which Microsoft claims is four times more powerful than the Xbox One CPU, and its newly-announced Radeon RDNA graphics architecture. Microsoft is promising support for real-time hardware-accelerated ray tracing, a graphics feature that allows highly authentic lighting and shadow effects, as well as 8K resolution capability. The console will use high bandwidth GDDR6 system memory to boost performance. In a teaser video shown at Microsoft’s E3 press conference, a Microsoft spokesperson claimed the console would usher in a new era of 120-frames-per-second visuals.Microsoft also revealed that, like the PlayStation 5, the console will utilise a solid state drive (SSD), which will mean faster loading times: a reduction in the time it takes for new scenes and levels to load during games. Microsoft’s teaser trailer promised 40 times the efficiency of the Xbox One drive.In a nod to its millions of legacy gamers, Microsoft promised that Scarlett will support “four generations” of Xbox gaming, suggesting integral backwards compatibility, or access to downloadable or streaming content from the Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One.Microsoft also announced that from October, Xbox owners will be able to stream games from an Xbox One console to smartphones and tablets using the company’s xCloud streaming technology.At this stage, there look to be significant similarities between the approaches that Microsoft and Sony are taking toward the next generation of consoles. Notably, both companies have emphasised very strongly that these are games machines first and foremost. This contrasts with the Xbox One’s initial marketing as an “entertainment hub”, which highlighted its multimedia and live television functionality. There are also telling comparisons in the tech specs, with AMD chipsets at the forefront, ray-tracing as the new graphics benchmark, and SSD technology as a way to differentiate the coming consoles from their predecessors.With Sony yet to announce a launch date for the next PlayStation, however – the company decided not to participate in this year’s E3 video game expo – Microsoft has put itself out in front."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8707dcf1ac67f733319566b44b141805216c014c/9_0_880_528/master/880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14d4f90977cd25359fecada130d8b532","title":"e3 2019 liveblog all the news from microsofts xbox conference","story":"At its E3 2019 press conference, Microsoft showed a raft of new games and announced a release date for its next-generation console, Project Scarlett.

The trailer shows a marooned space soldier forlornly watching old messages from his family, when Master Chief shows up outside his craft, suspended in the void of space. He’s fixed up and brought back to life, and the iconic shield bar appears at the top of the screen...Project Scarlett is about power and performance, says Phil, where current consoles were about power. Scarlett is all about the ability to stream games as well as play them on-disc or from a download.A new Xbox console, Project Scarlett, will be out in 2020.From a processing perspective it is 4x as powerful as the Xbox One X, promising “resolution and framerates that we’ve never seen before” - 8k capability and 120fps. It’ll have a bespoke solid-state drive that delivers a 40x performance increase. What does this mean for players? No loading times and extremely high-end graphics. The word “seamless” came up about 12 times.For those of us who really care about having a console, though, rather than a cloud service that streams anywhere, Microsoft has developed a cutting-edge new Xbox. Here we go.Okay, here we go: Project xCloud is Microsoft’s cloud-streaming technology, and as of this October you will be able to use it to play your Xbox games anywhere, whether on a console at home or on another screen via streaming.Phil Spencer is back.

But it’s only now, with 55 films under her belt and as Big Little Lies returns to our screens, that she really feels free to ‘try anything’To hear her mother tell it, it’s a miracle that Laura Dern exists at all. In the early 1960s Diane Ladd and her then husband, Bruce Dern, suffered an excruciating loss when their 18-month-old daughter drowned. The trauma was not just emotional but physical, and doctors told her that she would be unable have another child. But they were wrong, and the proof was Dern. One confounded doctor travelled to the hospital to witness “the miracle child”. From her home in Ojai, California, Ladd’s smoky southern voice over the phone ripples gently with emotion as she talks to me about her daughter.The miracle child, now 52, grew up to be a great actor in her own right, sometimes even appearing alongside her mother. In 1991, Princess Diana was so taken by the idea that a real-life mother and daughter could play alternative versions of themselves on screen that she flew them both to London for a royal premiere of their garlanded film, Rambling Rose. Ladd recalls “pouring sweat” as she sat next to the princess. Dern was struck by the ways in which her host connected to her character. “She was empathy in cellular form.”A menu arrives, and Dern, who has been up since 5am nods enthusiastically at the suggestion of a strawberry tart. “A little sugar sounds amazing,” she says. The hotel is designed in the style of an English country home and Dern would like to know when we might get to talk about her love of London. “When I’m there I get to have Monmouth Coffee, the park, and the actor Andrew Garfield,” she says as if these three items were on everyone’s British bucket list. “What more do you need?” Why Garfield? “He’s a great, deep soul.” If Dern’s exuberance is a mask, she wears it very well. “It’s not ‘me’ to be a mystery,” she says, and then revises the thought. “Well, maybe I’m a mystery to a few boys in my life, but that’s good, that’s OK.”A night earlier, she had attended a screening of Trial by Fire, based on the real-life story of Cameron Todd Willingham, executed in Texas in 2004 for a crime he very likely did not commit. It is not a spoiler to say that the movie ends with an unflinching scene of death by lethal injection. A woman in the audience had turned to a friend and joked about needing a Valium to get through it.Long before they met in person, Dern (who plays activist Elizabeth Gilbert), had taken to writing long, intimate letters to Jack O’Connell (who plays Willingham) as a way to draw closer to Gilbert’s experience. “I reached out and said, ‘May we correspond by letter?’ and we did that very intimately, very deeply – we shared personal history and secrets.” For Dern, Gilbert’s letters were “empathy in action”. “Anyone can make a small gesture of kindness to another person that can effect change in the world, it’s that simple,” she says.Empathy is a favourite word of Dern’s – shorthand for the kind of communion she works to find with her characters, however compromised they may seem. In conversation, she seems to be looking for points of convergence and connection, in place of the usual wariness between the journalist and subject. Trump’s demonisation of Hollywood and the media have brought us together, she says. “How do we get the word out about what truth looks like, or what people are doing, or injustice, or what it is to be human and complicated?”The letters with O’Connell were also a kind of key Dern used to unlock her character. There is always a key. To prepare for Renata Klein, the clench-jawed control freak she plays on the runaway hit TV series, Big Little Lies, Dern interviewed female leaders in tech to help figure out her character’s motivation. In 2018, she won a Golden Globe for her efforts, one of four the series took home that year. “Renata is fierce and complicated and a nightmare, and also just wants a girlfriend and deserves to be seen because she’s lived in a man’s world her whole life,” she explains. “And what it takes for a woman in tech, a woman in banking, a woman in publishing – who you have to be and what you have to walk through to get the one seat in that boardroom of 13…”As on the show, the misogyny isn’t exclusive to men. One CEO of a major Silicon Valley startup confided in Dern how crushed she felt after a mother sent her a photo of her son playing soccer with a note that read, “Here’s a picture of your kid, I know you’re too busy to come to the games usually.” Dern throws her hands up in a gesture of exasperation. “She said, ‘I am a mom trying to show up and the people that shame me about being a working mother are the other moms.’” Dern would hear the same story in different variations over and again. Big Little Lies is about what men do to women, but it’s also about what women do to each other, and to themselves.Season one of Big Little Lies was framed by a mystery: someone was a victim and someone was a culprit. The who was the thread that kept audiences guessing until the finale. What can we expect for an encore? “They’re allowed to feel everything now, while also being watched,” says Dern. “What’s cool is that we are no longer servicing a whodunit plot, so the plot can be entrenched in the volcano of emotion we’re all feeling.” For Ladd, who launched her career as a chorus girl at New York’s Copacabana, the prospect of her daughter joining the family trade was a dismal one. “I did not want my daughter to be an actress, but she outsmarted me,” she recalls. “She said, ‘Oh mother, if I could play the piano, would you tie my hands behind my back and tell me I had to wait until I was 21 to play?’” At the age of 17, Dern sued for emancipation, a kind of legal orce that allows children to make decisions without parental approval. She says it was not personal, but professional. Ladd allowed her to leave home on the condition she live with Marianne Williamson, a writer of self-help books now vying for the Democratic nomination for president.Although she always knew what kind of career she wanted, the template was changing by the time Dern was breaking out. “I was exposed to a real equality in the kind of characters that men and women played in storytelling,” Dern remembers. “But once I started auditioning, 10 years later, the roles weren’t the same. Something shifted and we were back to the Madonna-or-whore in a movie.”She remembers a prescient encounter at school, when she was 14, shortly after wrapping Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains, about a girl punk band. “A boy was sitting with me and my best friend, and he was a year older than us, and he said, ‘I know the kind of girl you are.’ And I’m like, ‘The kind of girl I am?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, you know, there’s two kinds of girls: the kind you sleep with and the kind you want to marry.’” Dern, he said, was the kind of girl a guy married her friend was the kind a guy just slept with. “We were both equally crushed,” she says. “It was like someone branded us.” Dern internalised the boy’s comment. “I was left feeling like if I didn’t lead with sexuality I wasn’t enough, that if I didn’t prove to a boy that I could be all things, I’d failed,” she says. “And yet I won the prize because I got picked for a long time my friend felt hot, but a throwaway.”It was David Lynch, says Dern, who showed her that she could be all things equally. He cast her first in Blue Velvet and then some years later in Wild at Heart, his twisted road movie about two lovers on the run. “Wild at Heart is so interesting because I’m all of it,” says Dern. “I’m the girl he picks, and she’s sexual and wild, and it’s all about mess and insanity, but it’s a gift when you can be all of it.”Lately, Dern has found herself playing a multitude of mothers. It has come at just the moment when she finds her own children – Ellery, her 17-year-old son, and Jaya, her 14-year-old daughter, both from her former marriage to the musician Ben Harper (the couple orced in 2012) – taking tentative steps towards their adult lives. Last September Ellery walked the runway for Calvin Klein. “Suddenly my son is 17, and I’m realising he may not always live in my house with me, and that has been rather devastating.” The actor smiles glumly. “As a parent, I felt and thought that, forever, my life would look and feel just like this.” Meanwhile, Dern’s maternal instinct continues to blossom into a series of powerful onscreen matriarchs. “I love playing characters who lead with their desperation and their rage, and their ferocity and their loneliness and their vulnerability, because these were all things that when I started acting weren’t necessarily on the page.”She used to think she was fearless, but turning 50 shifted her perspective. Sometimes she thinks that she is only just catching up with her daughter in the way she is learning to think about herself. “That generation doesn’t believe that anyone has the right to define who they are to them, and that includes their sexuality, their sense of self, how they want to be, quote, ‘branded’,” she says. “Boy, we were all raised so differently.” It’s become hackneyed to talk about self-actualisation, but Dern seems to be a living embodiment, a woman who might actually be able to say she’s living her best life and mean it.“What comes with this moment in life, for me, is a kind of sense of boldness that I thought I had in my 20s, that I was actually nowhere near,” she says. “Now I feel like I’m ready to be an actor, now I feel I want to tackle anything. Now there’s just a longing to explore more, e deeper, find things that scare me. And go towards them.”Big Little Lies starts on Sky Atlantic at 2am tomorrow morning, repeated at 9pm, exclusively on Sky Atlantic \u0026amp Now TV, courtesy of HBOLaura Dern’s styling by Mary Inacio from The Wall Group hair by Paul Norton at traceymattingly using IGK makeup by Jo Strettell at traceymattingly using Serucell Skincare"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ff7740c1e231c14a5ae127ec1f918f303d974ff/0_97_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b90e9561d0219912817be801ee1ae9e","title":"suspects left in legal limbo by delays to inquiries say solicitors","story":"Survey on use of RUI reveals in one case suspect waited four years for case to be resolvedSuspects are increasingly being left in legal limbo as they are subjected to inquiries lasting years that sometimes end with the case being dropped, a survey of criminal solicitors has revealed.The full extent of police use of the “released under investigation” (RUI) tactic is revealed in a study that shows more than half of firms who responded represent clients who have been waiting for between 18 months and two years.The study by the London Criminal Courts Solicitors’ Association (LCCSA) was conducted in the capital, the south-east and north-west of England. In one case a suspect was found to have been waiting four years for his case to be resolved.A total of 6,519 cases designated RUI were reported in the past three months by the 109 criminal lawyers who responded to the survey. The alleged offences included serious crimes including rape, sexual assault, homicide, fraud, bribery, theft, racially aggravated crimes and dishonesty.Of the lawyers who said clients had been under investigation for between 18 months and two years, most reported the cases involved allegations of rape, sexual assault and serious drug offences – leaving victims and suspects without safeguards or supervision.The Policing and Crime Act 2017 established tighter conditions for police bail, limiting it to 28 days with three-month extensions on the authorisation of a senior officer. It was introduced after the high-profile case against the BBC presenter Paul Gambaccini, who campaigned to end unlimited bail: the case was eventually dropped.The complexity of the new regulations and short deadlines, however, mean that officers are increasingly failing to subject suspects to formal conditions such as reporting regularly to police stations.In one example highlighted by the LCCSA, a suspect was released under investigation for rape. His partner left him, he lost his home and business, and at times felt suicidal. “I’ve been to hell and back, living under a cloud of suspicion for more than two years,” Duncan (not his real name) said. Just over two years after arrest the case against him was dropped.Kerry Hudson, a defence solicitor and the vice-president of the LCCSA, said: “The legal limbo of releasing suspects under investigation came about as an unintended consequence of a law change to arrest and charging laws.“Once a 28-day time limit was imposed to bail it became obvious the police could never keep to that timeframe. This legal no man’s land emerged as a fudged workaround by hard-pressed, under-resourced police.“It is failing everyone in the justice system. For suspects – who, let’s remember, are innocent until proven guilty – it spells a life on hold, causing untold stress and mental health problems, shattering families, homes and livelihoods. We’re very aware it lets victims and complainants down too.”Rumit Shah of the London law firm Galbraith Branley said: “Most clients find it difficult to move on with their lives. Some are left in limbo for such a long time that it has an impact on their mental wellbeing and affects the loved ones around them. With youths they struggle to continue their education because they constantly have the investigation in the back of their mind.”A Home Office spokesman said: “The police can still use pre-charge bail in cases where it is necessary and proportionate, including where bail conditions are needed to protect victims.“The National Police Chief’s Council guidance, issued to police forces earlier this year, states that in cases involving high-harm crimes, such as domestic abuse and sexual violence, pre-charge bail should be seriously considered and senior detectives consulted if a suspect is released only under investigation.“Cases where iniduals are released under investigation must also be regularly reviewed and effectively managed, with both suspects and victims kept updated.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4da682cfe55b763ab9c199fa7509b5387555603/0_0_1430_858/master/1430.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b7533395ab325f88712ecf61d203136","title":"app creep and the dark side of sharing private date on our phones","story":"Most of us happily upload the most personal information on to the apps we use everyday. But do we really want to share our data with organisations funded by anti-abortion campaigners?Updating a mental list of what our phones have become today includes, but is not limited to, high street, museum, magazine, therapist, nightclub, funhouse mirror, personal trainer and abusive partner. A chilling recent addition is “crisis pregnancy centre”.Truth is malleable for organisations funded by anti-abortion campaigners, and they continue to insert themselves into women’s lives uninvited, like wasps at a picnic. Sometimes they are clear about their intentions, like those who continue to “protest” outside UK clinics and film the people entering, after Sajid Javid rejected a call to create protective buffer zones around abortion clinics. And sometimes they crawl in under the door, as has been the case with the fertility app Femm, revealed last week to be bankrolled by a hedge-funder who campaigns against abortion and birth control.To the hundreds of thousands of women who have downloaded this app and might, therefore, now be wondering when their next period is due, or indeed if: the call is not just coming from inside the house, the call is coming from inside the phone. This is the latest reminder that, despite their chatty tone, and their grateful acceptance of more than 100 million women’s monthly details of headaches, sex lives and menstrual flows, fertility-tracking apps are not our friends.Apps have become the places where we bury all our secrets. The parts of our bodies we want to inflate, the ones we want to shrink, the age range of people we want to meet and where, and the types of sex we want to have with them and how, our legal history, the value of houses we can afford, the celebrities we spy on, the steps we have walked, how long we have slept and for what proportion of that time we snored. But the secrets don’t remain buried for long – the secrets are seeds, and they sprout, appearing again as targeted ads for kitchens and razors and ovulation tests.Of 24 health apps in a recent BMJ study, 19 shared user data with companies, including Facebook, Google and Amazon, despite developers regularly claiming they did not collect personally identifiable information. In January, Bloomberg Businessweek reported fertility apps had raised at least $350m since they launched, in part through their use of the intimate data they collect – data we hand over with a casual click, despite the fact that apps don’t have to meet the privacy standards of hospitals. And despite the fact they don’t always get it right. Fertility awareness, promoted on tracking apps, is considered the least effective method of birth control, resulting in around 24 pregnancies for every 100 women a year. It makes such cruel sense that a pro-life organisation should choose to weaponise them.App-creep is something most people have wondered about, whether halfway through their third night of insomnia and suddenly drowning in mattress ads, or having discussed their dying pot plants with an auntie, only to then get aggressively marketed ads from succulent sellers. Are our phones listening to us? Mark Zuckerberg says no. Is the truth, then, simply that we are as predictable as water? That a person your age, friends with your friends, logging into the WiFi at B\u0026ampQ and spending £3 on a coffee, is likely to be in the market for an entry level cactus? Is the truth that we give information loosely and freely, combing over the bald patch of suspicion that it may, at any time, be used against us? I’m not sure which is more scary.But, silver lining (well, silver-plated – it tarnishes with use), the Femm revelation is a good lesson in modern life. Like so many of our daily contemporary compromises, “what we pay in order to get something for free” is a lesson everybody needs to be educated in. An education that must be revised with every phone update. Children learn the names of every dinosaur by the time they’re three, and how to customise their Snapchat emojis by the time they’re 13. However opaque the technical details of what our phones are taking from us, surely we should have the capacity to learn the implications of clicking “agree”, so that when we choose to buy a phone, we don’t get owned ourselves.Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer or follow her on Twitter@EvaWiseman"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10fab5b82aae3cb5359f84440d0bdceef87c1bfb/0_0_5537_3692/master/5537.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27bf49bdb9657c86443d1b8f7910b069 660w","title":"flight airline travel rail family environment","story":"Campaigners want us to take fewer flights, but ditching the plane for a train is easier said than doneWhen 16-year-old climate change activist Greta Thunberg arrived in London as part of her awareness tour in April, the way she travelled was part of her message. After leaving her home in Stockholm, she went to Strasbourg and then Rome before going to the UK, all by train.The journey was part of the flygskam, or “flight-shaming”, movement, which encourages the feeling of being embarrassed or ashamed to take the plane because of the environmental impact.Thunberg has not flown since 2015 and is urging others to turn their backs on aviation for good.But for families planning a summer holiday, just how practical and cost-effective is it to shun air travel? Leaving aside the obvious concerns of dragging young children across the continent for many multiples of the hours it takes to fly to traditional holiday destinations – let alone further afield – there are questions over how many bags can be taken, comfort, and the possibility of industrial action, technical problems or delays. Those in favour of avoiding airports would argue that the same things can occur when going by plane.So is more ethical travel a realistic possibility for families?As a mother of four children aged from two to 11, Helen Hamston illustrates the views of many parents when she says the thought of a long-haul train journey in Europe fills her with horror.“Being confined in a carriage with members of the public where my kids are on show would be highly stressful. My toddler doesn’t sit still for long, and how many snacks would I need to pack for that length of journey? Changing trains would be like a military operation and when everyone is tired and hungry it just doesn’t sound like much fun. At least a flight is over more quickly,” says Hamston, who runs Mummy’s Gin Fund, an online advice forum and buy-and-sell platform for parents.It is a thought that will draw sympathy from many, and highlights the logistical problem of moving a young family from one destination to the next by rail. Hamston, who lives in Devon, says that for families with older children cross-country train journeys could be a great experience, but for now she is sticking with staycations.With baggage charges, the cost of getting to and from an airport and inflated food costs along the way, even the most budget of flights can balloon in cost quickly.There may be an expectation that, because of the amount of time it takes to get to your destination, rail, road and ferry would automatically be cheaper.The reality is not so clear-cut – particularly if you have to travel at peak times within the confines of school holidays.As a general rule the earlier you book – for most modes of travel – the cheaper the deal. Rail, ferry and airline companies use dynamic pricing, so shopping around in advance will usually pay off.Being flexible on travel dates will also help. Fridays and weekends are notoriously busy days for rail travel, for example, so passengers will usually pay more compared with midweek tickets. A search conducted recently for a return trip from London to Bordeaux for a family of four at the end of July (travelling midweek) would cost about £500 by train (Eurostar and TGV) or around £400 to fly with a low-cost airline, including check-in bags.While the train takes around six and a half hours, the flight is one hour 45 minutes. The return ferry crossing came in at £162 – a relative bargain, but petrol costs and probably an overnight stop would need to be included in the budget, not to mention the extra time taken.For longer journeys, the cost of travelling by train or car can increase significantly.The push towards more ethical travel has brought results. An increasing number of people are becoming more concerned with how they travel, says Lucy Bishop from Manchester-based Travel Counsellors.This extends from the destinations they choose to using local businesses when abroad. However, she has yet to see a considerable shift away from flying, she adds.“For most families it comes down to the time constraints,” says Bishop. “But also cost and practicality mean they have to fly if they want to go abroad.“A long train journey or road trip can be appealing for couples and singletons. They often view it as part of the holiday, making interesting stops en route. But travelling by train to popular family destinations, such as Greece, southern Spain and Portugal, just isn’t realistic if you have a big family and you’ve only got 10 days or two weeks.”Yet with growing pressure and heightened concern around global heating – plus potentially higher taxes in future on flights, to counter carbon emissions, and the social effect of “flight shaming” – it is possible there will be a more substantial shift in the coming years in the way holidaymakers travel.Muna Suleiman, campaigns officer at Friends of the Earth, urges families to be braver about their summer holiday plans and to ditch air travel.“Take action to cut pollution by thinking twice before hopping on a plane for your holiday,” she says. “You might be surprised how many beautiful parts of the world you can reach by train and how relaxing the journey can be – even with children.”Rail and road travel by the British on the continent is not a new trend – families have been taking the car to France, Germany, even Italy and northern Spain for years and Europe’s railway networks are a perennial favourite with gap-year students.Making the most out of potential savings for rail travel involves planning ahead. Being able to buy tickets in advance online has made things much easier, more transparent and cheaper.Mark Smith, founder of the train-travel website Seat61, provides tips on travelling by rail overseas. They include the rules on child fares in different countries and many of the ticketing pitfalls to look out for, such as how some booking websites don’t apply discounts on child fares so they can end up costing more than the adult ticket.Tickets are typically released between 60 and 90 days ahead of travel. If a family can be flexible with dates, try different options such as days of the week and times of the day, as ticket cost can vary widely.Smith recommends bargains such as Deutsche Bahn’s “Sparpreis London” fares from London to anywhere in Germany starting from €59.90 each way and Czech Railways, which offers Brussels to Prague fares from just €21.Elisa Vertue, 41, lives in south-east London with husband James Wilson, 43, and children Maia, five, and Rudy, four, but is originally from Milan and takes regular trips home.The family travel back to Italy at least twice a year, sometimes flying and at other times taking their motorhome. But Elisa and James, who run their own IT support business, say they are increasingly thinking about the impact on the environment.In July this year the family is going to northern Croatia to meet Elisa’s sister and her family for a three-week holiday. Elisa had looked into flying and the price was reasonable for the short hop to Europe, but instead the family has decided to take their motorhome and will make two stops in Europe on both legs of the journey.“When I thought about it, I didn’t want to fly,” says Elisa. “If we take the motorhome there will be less carbon emissions. We can also make the journey fun for the children. They will see a lot more of Europe as we will make stops in France and Austria.“Elisa paid £123 for the Dover to Calais ferry crossing and £145 for the Eurotunnel on the return journey. The faster Eurotunnel train is her preferred option but it was fully booked on the outward date.Elisa estimates it will take between two and a half and three full tanks of petrol to drive the 17 hours to Vrsar in Croatia. This could cost more than £250 for the 2.8 litre turbocharged motorhome, but they won’t need to pay for hotels on the journey or once they arrive.“As a total holiday package, taking the motorhome works out cheaper as we won’t have accommodation costs once we get to Croatia,” says Elisa. “But our carbon footprint should also be lower as we’ve chosen not to fly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ace827823da61c96ca61870b635f98b24878b76/0_203_2997_1798/master/2997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7463a82175d32e112443e075a757a2d9","title":"china other tiananmens podcast","story":"Hundreds of Chinese cities were involved in the student-led demos in 1989. ’s Lily Kuo discusses the uprisings outside of Beijing.

You should know, we won’t wait for him to do those things to begin to push back. We will do our level best. It’s too risky and too important and too hard once it’s already happened.”A Labour spokesman said: “President Trump and his officials’ attempts to decide who will be Britain’s next prime minister are an entirely unacceptable interference in the UK’s democracy.” He added that the party was “fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and is implacably opposed to antisemitism in any form”.Pompeo’s comments emerged after Trump turned down Corbyn’s request for a meeting during his state visit to the UK last week, saying the leader was “somewhat of a negative force”. Corbyn joined protests outside Trump’s press conference with Theresa May, where he pledged to oppose the US president’s drive for greater access for US health companies to NHS contracts.The comments come at a time when Corbyn’s team are nervous about the latest attempts to oust him from within the party over the issues of antisemitism and Brexit, after several senior figures came out in support of a second referendum.Shadow cabinet sources said the leadership was preparing to take on Tom Watson and his supporters after his vocal campaign to soften Corbyn’s Brexit position, with moves under way to generate momentum in favour of a new deputy leadership election.There is growing talk about the possibility of the party’s rules being changed to create a second deputy leader, alongside Watson, but also the possibility of a new deputy leadership contest altogether. Some Corbyn supporters are circulating motions against Watson around local constituency Labour parties and a grassroots petition against the deputy leader has got about 26,000 signatures so far.One shadow cabinet minister said they believed the leadership wanted to make the shadow cabinet less in favour of a second referendum. As part of this, Corbyn’s team considered swapping Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, with Diane Abbott, the home secretary, over her support for a second referendum and wider foreign policy issues.However, it is understood that Thornberry has more recently been assured that she will not be moved and that Abbott was opposed to such a plan anyway, which would make the move difficult to carry out without a public battle.A Labour source said there were no plans at all for a reshuffle and dismissed speculation about moves within the top team as mischief-making.Talk of a reshuffle was sparked when Thornberry was dropped as Corbyn’s usual stand-in for prime minister’s questions this week after speaking out about Labour’s strategy for the European elections. On polling day last month, Thornberry said Labour was “not clear on the one single thing that people wanted to hear”. She was replaced at the dispatch box by Rebecca Long-Bailey, a rising star on the left of the party and a staunch Corbyn loyalist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84386169d3efa3af678cd777312c5862c8ddeb73/0_173_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4448e9fbf39cd01ca66b086c5e33dd3","title":"bath abbeys east wing reopens after floor restoration","story":"Work to stop slabs crashing into burial spaces beneath has uncovered a wealth of surprises A painstaking operation to stop the floor of one of the UK’s great churches caving into the burial spaces beneath the great stone slabs has reached an important stage.The east wing of Bath Abbey, which has been hidden behind hoardings for more than a year, was reopened for members of the congregation on Sunday and from Monday visitors will be able to tread the much more stable floor.Experts have lifted and restored hundreds of slabs, many of them ledger stones inscribed with the names of the people whose remainslie beneath.The structure has been made more solid and underfloor heating built in that will use the hot water from Bath’s famous springs to heat the building.The churchwarden, James Playfair, said the abbey was delighted with the renovated floor. “It’s noticeably flatter and there are lovely variations in colour. It used to be uniformly grey,” he said.Playfair said Bath’s popularity as a place to take the waters as a cure in the 17th and 18th centuries have led to the problems with the abbey’s floor. Not all of the ailing visitors were healed and thousands were buried underneath the church. Over the centuries voids have appeared beneath the floor, leading to subsidence.The “Footprint” project to restore the floor at a cost of almost £20m began in May 2018.There have been many challenges. The nature of the building means that very little machinery can be used. Stones have been lifted using block and tackle – and sheer human brute strength.Problems have included the unexpected unearthing of seven intact lead coffins. The contractors intended to bury them beneath the new floor structure – but as they dug deeper they came across the vividly coloured tiles of a 13th-century floor.The tiles offered a glimpse of what the interior of the grand Norman cathedral that once stood on the site would have looked like. The tiles were recorded before being covered by a protective membrane and sand and have been left hidden 2 metres under the floor.The discovery of the 13th-century floor meant that the coffins could not be reburied and they have been relocated to the abbey cemetery on the outskirts of Bath.However, there is more work to be done. The next phase of restoration involves repeating the process in the north side of the abbey and, finally, the south section will be sealed off and the floor lifted and restored. The scheme is due to be finished in 2021.Alix Gilmer, the project director of Footprint, said: “We are delighted that we are able to open up the east end of the church again. The wealth of discoveries that were found underneath the floor has been truly amazing and it really is incredible to see the restoration of the ledger stones. So much work has been carried out, but there is still a huge amount ahead as we move into phase two.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf8c4264f8f28d9860a2c395aac2935a4665685f/0_84_2816_1690/master/2816.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce3d86a080bfe18063405d113c723f42","title":"ancient asteroid crater off coast scotland","story":"Space object about a mile wide believed to have crashed into Earth around 1.2bn years agoThe location of an ancient impact crater made by the biggest asteroid ever to hit Britain has been traced to a spot under the sea between mainland Scotland and the Outer Hebrides.Researchers at Oxford and Aberdeen universities found signs of the violent collision in Scotland on a field trip in 2008, but have only now pinpointed where the asteroid came down.Tests on rocks near Ullapool in north-west Scotland revealed that an object about a mile wide had crashed into a spot in the Minch, a strait that separates the mainland and northern Inner Hebrides from Lewis and Harris, six miles west of the village of Lochinver.The 38,000 mph collision, which thumped a 12-mile-wide crater into the ground, happened 1.2bn years ago, when most life on Earth was still in the oceans and plants had yet to take root on land. At the time, what is now Scotland was a semi-arid land that lay close to the equator.“The impact would have sent huge roiling clouds of dust and gas at several hundred degrees in all directions from the impact site,” said Ken Amor, an Oxford researcher who led the latest study. What is left of the crater is submerged in 200-metre-deep water and covered in sediment.The first hints of the impact came more than a decade ago when Amor was helping undergraduates on a geology field trip in the Scottish Highlands. On the last day, the scientists stopped in Stoer, a small village, to inspect an unusual rock formation known as the Stac Fada member (SFM).Previous researchers speculated that the distinctive red sandstone had come from a volcano, but Amor realised that “strange green blobs” in the rock resembled features of an impact crater that underlies the town of Nördlingen near the Danube in western Bavaria. Amor took samples of the SFM back to Oxford and found strong evidence of an asteroid strike: quartz crystals that had been deformed by the shock of an impact. He also found high levels of platinum and palladium, metals that are enriched in meteorites, the name given to space rocks that survive their fiery passage through the atmosphere to reach Earth’s surface.Assuming the crater has not been eroded away, it should be possible to detect with a seismic reflection survey of the kind used by prospecting oil companies, Amor said. Further studies of the rock might enable scientists to trace the meteorite back to a family of asteroids still orbiting the sun.It is unclear how common such impacts are because craters are wiped from Earth’s surface by erosion, burial and plate tectonics. However, asteroids of the size of the one that hit the Minch are thought to strike between once every 100,000 years and once every 1m years. While the impact would have been dramatic, sending a mushroom cloud and fireball high into the sky, it was minor compared with the spectacular strike in Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula 66m years ago, when a space rock estimated at six to 50 miles wide put an end to the rein of the dinosaurs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab309586e55bd02f5ee85455752643cf5918b5e/0_2614_3370_2021/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f1928947d8c7bea65c453b3c93bace","title":"share your experiences of sure start childrens centres","story":"Whether you helped set up the programme in your area or your family used a centre near you, we would like to hear your storiesThe flagship Sure Start programme has saved the NHS millions of pounds through the benefits it has brought to children including some of the most deprived areas and reducing the number of those taken to hospital, according to a study.Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies “found that where Sure Start offered high levels of service in poor neighbourhoods in England, visits to hospital to treat injuries fell among all children of primary school age, and by a third of all 11-year-olds”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow early years minister, said: “This research shows the critical role Sure Start plays in children’s health, as well as their development.

Yet her central role was largely forgotten in the rush to praise her colleagues, Prof Sir Robert Edwards and the surgeon Patrick Steptoe.The letters show that Purdy’s name was left off a plaque honouring her two colleagues, despite protests from Edwards.Letters revealed in Edwards’ archive show that he wrote to Oldham Area Health Authority in 1980 asking if it would be possible to have plaques at the hospitals involved “to do justice to the participants involved”, and he proposed including Purdy’s name.In a reply from an administrator, he was told that the authorised wording would read: “Human in vitro fertilisation followed by the world’s first successful pregnancy, was performed in this hospital by Mr Patrick Steptoe, Dr Robert Edwards and their supporting staff in November 1977.”Administrator David Killion wrote: “I hope you will find it sufficiently acceptable to enable us at least to put up something to commemorate your work, even if this does not describe it as fully or as clearly as you would wish.”Edwards protested in a letter of 1981, writing: “I feel strongly about the inclusion of the names of the people who helped with the conception of Louise Brown. I feel this especially about Jean Purdy, who travelled to Oldham with me for 10 years, and contributed as much as I did to the project. Indeed, I regard her as an equal contributor to Patrick Steptoe and myself.”However, the plaque at Kershaw’s Cottage hospital near Oldham was put up without Purdy’s name.The letters have been released from Edwards’ private papers, which are held at Cambridge University’s Churchill Archives Centre and have been opened to the public following work to catalogue the collection funded by the Wellcome Trust.Madelin Evans, an archivist, said the letters do not reveal an “explicit reason” why Purdy’s name was omitted but that “it probably had quite a bit to do with the fact she was a nurse, an embryologist and a woman I suppose”.Asked if it was a case of sexism, she said: “I think it was probably one of the factors, and the fact probably that nurses weren’t seen as important maybe as doctors and scientists.”Purdy, who died from cancer in 1985 aged 39, was described by Edwards as “crucial” to their IVF work and was the first person to witness the successful cell ision of the embryo that would become Louise Brown.Having initially joined the team as a lab technician, Purdy became so indispensable that work stopped for several months when she had to care for her ailing mother.Edwards was awarded a Nobel prize in 2010 for the development of IVF and was knighted in 2011. Neither award can be made posthumously, so acknowledgment came too late for Purdy and Steptoe (who died in 1988) – but the discovery was a team effort."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd1b3be9c87ffd30619cf4202a3718829bb38216/106_510_4037_2422/master/4037.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39d40c161b0f4f7bf84072b6fd7f7619","title":"india australia cricket world cup match report","story":"Whatever it may take to check India’s stately progress towards the semi-finals of the World Cup, they have not met it yet. They swept past South Africa and on Sunday they steamrollered Australia. They won by 36 runs but the margin was much closer than the contest, which felt, for most of the day, like it was only heading one way.India started it with a partnership of 127 between Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan, and finished it, eight hours later, with Bhuvneshwar Kumar taking the final wicket with the last delivery. The only reason it wound up as tight as it did was because Australia fought a pigheaded rearguard in the second innings.They were overwhelmed on the field and off it, where their solitary knot of fans in the corner of the Peter May stand looked like a pinprick of sunshine in the midst of a wide blue sky of India supporters. At one point Virat Kohli even asked his supporters to go easy. They were booing Steve Smith when he was fielding at long-off, until Kohli broke off from his batting and started shouting at them to clap him instead.There was an uneasy moment, too, when Adam Zampa was caught on camera fiddling around with an object in his pocket while he was holding the ball. His captain, Aaron Finch, said later that Zampa was only using a handwarmer.Kohli’s kind gesture was the only mercy he showed. Ominously, it felt in the end, he and his team still had plenty left to give if they needed it, that they had not had to bowl or bat as well as they can.Their innings started slowly after Kohli won the toss. Dhawan and Sharma spent the opening overs settling in. Although, given Mitchell Starc was on at one end and Pat Cummins the other, they did not find it all that easy to get comfortable.Starc almost had Sharma in the second over but the ball burst through Nathan Coulter-Nile’s grasp at short mid-wicket. And then Starc cracked Dhawan on the left hand with a wicked delivery that spat like hot fat from just back of a length. Dhawan needed treatment and afterwards he was careful to play him from deeper back in his crease. He did not field either.After seven overs, India had only 22, then Finch brought on Coulter-Nile and the innings started to snowball. Dhawan clapped one four down the ground, whacked another through point, and slapped a third through third man.India had clearly decided that if they could just see off Starc and Cummins, then the rest of Australia’s attack would be easier to get at. Finch kept making changes, fiddling around with his two spinners and bringing back Starc and Cummins when he had to but Dhawan and Sharma pressed on, accelerating steadily, up to five, then six runs an over.Dhawan was doing most of the work. He was severe on Marcus Stoinis. He uppercut him over the wicketkeeper’s head and hit him for a preposterous inside-out cover drive. It was the 23rd over before Sharma sliced a loose drive and was caught behind. The ground fell silent but the lull did not last long because Kohli was next man in. It made for a smooth progression, although everything did seem to get a little nervous when Dhawan reached 99, the tension was increased by the heartbeat thump of all those Indian drums.He almost blew it, too. Stoinis was bowling and Dhawan prodded the ball to mid-on. Kohli called him through but Dhawan hesitated and Kohli turned to e back to his crease as the throw came in. The ball ricocheted off the stumps and the batsmen ran the single after all but before they or anyone else could celebrate they had to wait for the TV replay to see whether Kohli was out. It was 37th over before Australia took another wicket, when Dhawan hoicked a catch to deep mid-wicket on 117.Soon after, India finally slipped into something near top gear. They promoted Hardik Pandya to No 4, and he blazed 48 off 27 balls. Even his dismissal only brought in MS Dhoni, who clobbered 27 off 14. Even Starc and Cummins could not do anything much to slow them down now. Kohli finished with 82 off 77.Facing an imposing total of 352, Australia decided to try to win it with the sort of batting tactics that were last in fashion when their coach, Justin Langer, was still playing.David Warner played another bizarre innings of 56 from 84 balls before he was caught at deep midwicket. He is batting in shackles at the moment. Finch went well, but then he was run out hesitating over a second that Warner called for, which did not help.Smith fared better but still was not able to score any quicker than a run a ball before he was given out lbw to Kumar for 69. Australia still needed 115 and there were only 10 overs to go. Glenn Maxwell (28 off 14 balls) and Alex Carey (55 off 35) finally started batting with some urgency but it was too little, too late."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9d6dbf4a03513f496be688c21137215cb8c3dd4/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=285e57b7fb9af871a4e0c12582b5623c","title":"lewis hamilton canadian grand prix vettel penalty","story":"• Ferrari finishes first but five-second penalty puts him second • Vettel penalised for forcing Hamilton off track earlier in raceOptimistic that finally he might claim Ferrari’s first victory this season, Sebastian Vettel’s hopes turned to bitter ashes as he was denied by a controversial penalty at the Canadian Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton took the win for Mercedes but only after an incident that left Vettel fuming, disappointed and confused as to how the decision against him was made. The race had been in his and Ferrari’s hands but they were denied as the finale descended almost to pantomime, leaving little pleasure for any of the drivers involved, not least Hamilton.Hamilton won the 50th Canadian Grand Prix having started from second behind Vettel and remained in that position. He had not looked like he had the pace to pass despite chasing relentlessly until a moment of high drama changed the race.Vettel pushing hard, lost the rear at turn four on lap 48, went across the grass and almost hit Hamilton as he returned to the track on the inside and Hamilton attempted to go around him. Vettel emerged in front and the incident was investigated by the stewards.Shortly afterwards they gave Vettel a five-second penalty for an unsafe return and forcing another car off the track. He held his lead to the end but was only 1.3 seconds in front of Hamilton who thus took the win. Ferrari have appealed against the decision.Vettel was angry and confused. “I had nowhere to go. They are stealing the race from us,” he said to his team. Then querying what he might have done having gone straight across the grass to rejoin the track. “No, no, no. Seriously you need to be an absolute blind man,” he said. “Let him pass and not control your car – where am I supposed to go? This is a wrong world, this is not fair.”He appeared to be struggling to control the car as it bounced across the grass as he rejoined, mitigating the circumstances and raising a major question of exactly what else he might have done as he fought for control of the car. He had made a mistake but it might easily have been dismissed as a racing incident.What followed the flag reflected how aggrieved the German felt. Vettel parked his car at the end of the pit lane and did not take part in the post-race interviews, immediately going instead to his team motorhome before returning to he podium ceremony. He is required to attend the podium and did so to a ringing endorsement of applause and cheers from the fans. On his way there the theatre continued as he moved the No 1 marker board from in front of Hamilton’s car, replacing it with the No 2 and put the original where his car would have stood had he brought it to the parc ferme.Visibly disheartened Vettel did finally stand for the ceremony but with a face that betrayed his distaste at the events that had unfolded. Hamilton invited him to the top step, a moment the German did not indulge for long. Finally interviewed and with the crowd cheering him he reflected their feelings. “You should ask the people what they think”, he said of the decision.“It’s not for us to decide and that’s the sport - everyone seems to believe that Sebastian won,” said Mattia Binotto, Ferrari’s team principal. “He was driving at the limit in each corner, and we are on the border line of the tyres. When he was coming back on the track he went on the grass and there was nothing he could do. We won today. Honestly as I said, we were the fastest on track and that is important”Hamilton, who similarly lost a win in Spa with a time penalty for cutting a corner in 2008, said: “That’s not the way I wanted to win but I would’ve been past.” He pointedly noted that he had pressured Vettel into an error and would have taken the place had he not had to avoid the German as he returned to the racing line. Hamilton was booed after the podium ceremony but Vettel immediately defended the British driver.Hamilton believed the stewards decision was correct. “I forced him into an error, he went a bit wide but then I had the run on that corner and we nearly collided. It is unfortunate but this is motor racing,” he said. “I took the corner normally but when you come back on track you are not supposed to go straight back on to racing line you are supposed to come back on safely.”In what was otherwise largely a procession for the front three, Vettel’s Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc took third. He finished in front of the second Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas and the Red Bull of Max Verstappen who came back from ninth on the grid to claim fifth. Bottas took the fastest lap.Having taken a victory Ferrari had hoped would narrow the championship gap in their favour, they have been cast even further adrift. Hamilton has extended his lead over Bottas to 29 points in the world championship, while Vettel has fallen to a full 62 points back.It was clearly not how Hamilton wanted to take the victory and perhaps not one he will take any great pleasure in, but he leaves Canada with his seventh victory here matching Michael Schumacher’s record tally. Vettel and Ferrari depart only with frustration and disappointment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e831240659a096031ddf3525f59ffa3063dfe7be/0_96_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=005513cb18c535ed98608116c441a677","title":"send tip uk river canal walk win 200 hotel voucher","story":"Full of nature, history and great pubs, our towpaths are fabulous places to walk.

There’s even a new festival in Verbier celebrating their popularityThe first time it happened was three years ago. I was cycling up the Col de l’Iseran in the French Alps with my friend Tim. At 2,764 metres, it’s the highest paved road in the Alps and, as we panted and gasped our way upwards, we were overtaken by a couple of middle-aged women chatting away happily.Tim and I like to think we’re reasonably fit, if not exactly Geraint Thomas, so I looked across at him in horror. To which he replied knowingly: “They’re on ebikes.” Phew.Being overtaken like this has now become a regular event on my rides in the Alps, and while I once complained about ebike riders “cheating”, I no longer can, as I recently bought my own electric mountain bike. Like countless others I’ve given in to the lure of the electric motor. Living in Les Arcs, in the French Alps, I can enjoy access to fantastic mountain bike routes when the ski lifts are open from July to the end of August, but getting to the top of those mountains once the lifts close is a long, hard slog, and I’m not getting any younger.Plenty of purists still argue that this is not “real” cycling, but if it gets you out and about on a bike – whether along a canal towpath or to the summit of Mont Ventoux – who cares?My ebike allows me to actually enjoy riding up hills, as well as letting me race down them at the same speed (if not faster) as on my regular mountain bike. Take, for example, the trails above my home on the edge of Les Arcs – there’s a mix of fire road and single-track climbs that ascend from 1,200 to over 2,000 metres and, when I ride up them on my normal bike, it’s not exactly a fun experience. Desperately gulping at the thinning air, I can usually see little more than the trail ahead as the sweat trickles down the lenses of my sunglasses. On my ebike I still have to make some effort but the motor (which has four levels of “assist”) reduces the effort enough for me to enjoy the scenery and the pine-scented air as I wend up through the forest to emerge, eventually, above the tree line.Rather than having to stop to get my breath back before I can take in the views, I’m able to pedal along at the same time as enjoying a spectacular alpine panorama of deep green valleys rising to high peaks, with the snowy Mont Blanc massif above.What’s more, on my regular mountain bike, I’d do this climb once, then belt back home and be done for the day – exhausted. On my ebike I have plenty of energy left to do another lap, maybe even two, which also undermines the assumption that you don’t get as much of a workout on an ebike. In fact, research has shown that ebike users get as much as seven times more use out of their bikes as regular cyclists, which makes up for the lack of effort required to power the bike.Ebikes have now become so popular that ski resorts like Avoriaz have introduced “uphill flow” trails – ones specifically designed to be ridden uphill. Add to this the fact that ebike riders don’t need to be whippet-thin Mamils (middle-age men in Lycra) to enjoy cycling through stunning scenery like that of the Alps, the Lake District and the Scottish Highlands, and it’s little wonder this is becoming the big new trend in cycling.This August, the Swiss Alps will host the world’s biggest ebike event: the four-day Verbier Ebike Festival is open to every level of rider, including absolute beginners, with the aim of introducing both converts and non-believers to road, downhill, and cross-country ebiking. It is set to be repeated annually.All participants will be supplied with ebikes if they don’t have their own, and there’s the chance to try out 30 brands of machine on the bike trails, gravel tracks and mountain roads. There’ll be bike tours, both guided and non-guided, that take in the best restaurants races for all levels of ability over 38km, 66km and 100km routes (plus kids’ races) and evening events including barbecues, concerts and the chance to meet professional ebike riders.Julien Hess, managing director of the festival, says the resort was inspired to hold the event by the growth in the number of ebikers and the demand for summer events in Verbier. “We expect the festival to attract visitors who come here to ski and now want to experience the area in summer, and to mountain bikers and cyclists of all ages and experience”.Hess sees ebiking as adding another string to the bow of resorts such as Verbier, giving them the opportunity to increase the number of summer visitors, allowing those visitors to rediscover the area without its winter snows, as well as giving pretty much everyone the chance to ride a bike in the mountains.“Ebikes also allow people with limited fitness or disabilities to enjoy cycling in the spectacular surroundings of the Alps, as well as helping in the battle against sedentary lifestyles.”As for the hair shirt brigade who claim ebiking is cheating, he simply says: “Come and give it a try and then we can talk again! And if you’ve already given it a go and are still not convinced, I’ll find you a challenge with an ebike that will make you change your mind …”• The Verbier Ebike Festival runs from 15-18 August.

Described as “the conscience of liberal Britain”, O’Brien is the author of the bestselling book How to Be Right...In a World Gone Wrong, a guide to challenging those who hold “unchallenged opinions”.I’m not interested in opinions unless they’re based on fact and, tragically, too many places in the media, particularly with regards to politicians, will allow people to say things that are simply not true and leave them unchallenged.How often do you think you change people’s minds?Not as often as I’d like. I had a chap at a festival of debate a few weeks ago who was a fully paid up member of the EDL before he started listening to my show and he stood up in front of 600 people and said: “I think you saved my life.” Those moments are incredibly important to me, but that’s extreme. I’m not arrogant or naive enough to think I’m moving the needle on national conversation anywhere near enough.If you call your book How to Be Right, is it fair for people to accuse you of being smug?I think people who peddle lies for a living call people who tell the truth smug. I’m not smug – smug would mean I was enjoying this.Do you feel people are fundamentally good?Of course I do you have to. Look at the effort being put in to make people believe bad things: the effort is immense, it’s the richest people on the planet, the most powerful media owners, it’s the demagogues with the biggest platforms, the season ticket holders on Question Time. There is a commercial and audience imperative in this country where if it gets chatter going and it gets clicks, a big reaction, then it must be good. But of course, when ordinary punters watch this stuff, they don’t see a circus or bonfire, they just get seduced by the narcissism and you don’t have good tunes if you’re on the side of kindness and decency – you have nothing to point at.You sound defeated even by the fightback!It’s pathetic. It’s astonishing the factionalism and the infighting is so much more important to a certain kind of leftwinger than taking on the Tories or in the last few years, the government.

Four protesters were killed in sporadic violence in the two cities.The Sudanese Professionals Association, a leading opposition group, said it had called on people to stay home in protest at the deaths of more than 100 people on Monday last week, when security forces violently dispersed a pro-democracy sit-in outside the military headquarters in Khartoum.“The peaceful resistance by civil disobedience and the general political strike is the fastest and most effective way to topple the military council … and to hand over power to a transitional civilian authority,” the SPA said.The military took power after ousting the then president, Omar al-Bashir, in April after months of mass rallies. The ruling Transitional Military Council has since refused demonstrators’ demands for an immediate move to civilian rule, instead pushing for a transitional power-sharing arrangement.Talks between the opposition Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces alliance and the TMC, which took power after Bashir’s departure, ground to a halt last month then collapsed altogether after the raid on the protest camp.Residents said heavily armed paramilitaries from the Rapid Support Forces were patrolling parts of Khartoum while the regular army has now deployed in some parts of Omdurman.The RSF, which is largely made up of militias accused of systemic human rights abuses during the war in Darfur, has been blamed for the killings last week. The force is led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo – known as Hemedti – who also serves as the deputy head of the TMC.The Sudan Doctors’ Committee, the medical affiliate of the SPA, said at least three people were killed on Sunday, including a young man who was shot dead by the RSF in Khartoum’s Bahri neighbourhood. The other two died of their injuries after RSF forces beat them in Omdurman, it said.Activists say that professionals including bankers, doctors, air traffic control staff, pilots, electrical engineers and economists have been targeted by intelligence services in what they say is an obvious attempt to break the strike.The central bank issued a statement that said it would not go on strike, but many employees stayed away.The SPA said airport workers and pilots were taking part in the civil disobedience, and posted photos of a deserted Khartoum international airport.“Dozens of airport workers have been arrested by intelligence and the RSF since Monday. We do not know their whereabouts,” an airport worker said on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisal.Activists said the total number of people detained by security services in recent days was unclear but was probably in the hundreds. Two opposition leaders who met the Ethiopian prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, in Khartoum on Friday have been detained, along with an opposition spokesman. Abiy was in the Sudanese capital to mediate between the TMC and the opposition, which has refused to reopen negotiations.The internet remains cut off in Khartoum, with other communications significantly restricted.Sudan’s military leaders have come under increasing international pressure in recent days. The brutal crackdown prompted outrage in the west while the African Union suspended the country and threatened sanctions if there was no swift transition to democracy.Even Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates appear to be moderating their previous policy of unconditional support for the TMC, after calls to senior officials from counterparts in Washington.The TMC will be hoping the opposition will not be able to sustain the shutdown for longer than a few days and, if the strike continues, will face a difficult choice: make concessions or intensify repression, risking further isolation and economic difficulties."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15e2a6bc719822b6742395ab8dba4805a14139e4/0_0_4219_2532/master/4219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09a93c0feb4466fc29fcc9419876bcbc","title":"newly restored 19th century german ship sinks after collision","story":"Elbe No 5, restored at a cost of €1.5m, collided with container vessel near HamburgA recently restored wooden sailing ship has sunk after colliding with a container vessel near Hamburg, northern Germany.Six adults and two children were injured when the gaff-rigged schooner Elbe No 5, originally built in 1883, collided with a Cyprus-flagged vessel, Astrosprinter, on the River Elbe after a failed tack steered the sailing ship directly into the container ship’s path.All 43 passengers were rescued almost immediately thanks to a quick response from five rescue boats that were attending a minor accident a few hundred meters away. “If we hadn’t been in the vicinity there could have been fatalities,” a fire service official, Wilfried Sprekels, told the local newspaper Stader Tageblatt.But the rescue team could not prevent the ship from sinking while they dragged it to shore.The 37-metre (121ft) schooner, built as a vehicle for pilots guiding larger craft from the sea to Hamburg’s port, was the city’s last remaining seagoing ship from the era of wooden vessels.In the 1920s the ship was sold to the US where the adventurer Warwick Tompkins and his family temporarily used it as a floating home. In 2002 the vessel returned to its home town where it could be rented for harbour excursions.In the last nine months the Elbe No 5 was renovated with new outer wooden planks and a new stern at a cost of €1.5m (£1.3m). It resumed taking visitors on tours around Hamburg’s harbour at the end of last month.Wolfgang Bentz, who worked on restoring the ship, told the radio station NDR that he and colleagues had spent the night watching over the wreck, whose broken mast was protruding from the water. “I couldn’t sleep all night,” he said.Bentz said there was a chance that the Elbe No 5 could take to sea again. “It’s made of wood and had some damage before. Let’s see what further damage is added in the rescue effort.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3919980.1560097910!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government vows to help teachers abroad return home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhen asked if the Government would consider more pay for teachers based in the greater Dublin area, the Minister replied that the cost of living was also an issue for other professions. File photograph: GettyMinister for Education Joe McHugh has pledged to tackle barriers preventing emigrant teachers returning home but has warned he does not have “any quick-fix ideas”.Mr McHugh is due to visit the United Arab Emirates this week to host a series of town hall-style meetings with teachers. The initiative is part of a drive to make it easier for them to return to Ireland.School management bodies say a shortage of teachers is causing a “crisis” due to a lack of substitute cover at primary level and qualified teachers in key subjects at second level.Speaking in advance of his visit, Mr McHugh said he wants to identify practical steps that could make it easier for teachers to return home.A key area he says he will examine is providing a mechanism to recognise teachers’ middle-management experience in schools abroad. Many emigrant teachers express frustration that, despite serving as heads of department, this experience is often not recognised here.“We have to look at the progression of teachers, what new skills, what experience they build up in terms of responsibility,” said Mr McHugh. “We have to open up a wider conversation over the roles of responsibility teachers have abroad and how we incorporate that into the system when they return home. I don’t have any quick-fix ideas around it . . . but those teachers bring experience, talent, insight and new perspectives.”Among the obstacles regularly cited by emigrant teachers include difficulties securing full-time posts at home, red-tape involving the Teaching Council as well as the cost of living.Online portalMr McHugh said a representative from the council will join him for the visit to take on board any ideas for streamlining registration or other issues. He said a new online portal, which opened last week, is an example of the kind of practical steps that would assist emigrant teachers.The portal – which operates under the title turasabhaile or “journey home” – will give teachers the opportunity to register their contact details, CVs, preferred employment location and specialist subjects.Mr McHugh, a former teacher who spent a year teaching in the UAE in the mid-1990s, said the visit also aimed to pay tribute to the contribution of Irish teachers abroad. He said teachers were magnificent ambassadors for the State and were boosting the country’s reputation wherever they go.There are an estimated 2,000 Irish-qualified teachers based in the UAE and hundreds have signed up for three meetings with the Minister in Abu Dhabi, El Ain and Dubai.When asked if the Government would consider additional pay for teachers based in the greater Dublin area – which faces some of the most acute shortages – Mr McHugh replied that the cost of living was also an issue for other professions.He is primarily concerned with looking at the kind of practical steps that can be taken in the short to medium term."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3919890.1560092000!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sitting the leaving cert aged 80 a great journey i feel very enriched","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  Anthony Lynam (80) from Inchicore, Dublin, who completed his Leaving Cert English exams. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Anthony Lynam left school as a youngster in 1955 without ever sitting a major exam.Now, at 80 years of age, he has finally set that right – and become one of the oldest students to ever take on the Leaving Cert.“I just got the notion last year,” says Mr Lynam, a former piano technician who lives on his own near Kilmainham in Dublin.“You hear so much about education today and how important the Leaving Cert is. I didn’t have any intention of studying the exam. I was just interested in learning.”Mr Lynam left secondary school in Crumlin when he was about 14, at a time when a minority of students went on to complete the Leaving Cert.“It was before free education. Most left after primary school. I was unusual in staying on for an extra two years. We had to pay two guineas.”Last September, after hearing about evening Leaving Cert courses at Crumlin College of Further Education, he decided to take on the higher level Leaving Cert English course.Daunting“The college was wonderful, absolutely fantastic,” he says. “I picked English because it was something I was familiar with . . . I’m not a great reader, or anything. So, I found it quite daunting.“Going through the past papers, I hadn’t a clue what they meant by some of the questions, but we were taken through it very well by the teachers.”He says he enjoyed studying Macbeth – and happily recites quotations from the play – as well as The Great Gatsby.For the poetry, he focused on WB Yeats, Brendan Kennelly and Séamus Heaney. Thankfully, he says, his choices paid off during the exam.His age also helped, he says, when it came to writing the essay.“There was a question about writing about your experiences of travel and the impression it made on your life,” he says. “I enjoyed that. I’ve been to a few places, all right.”The most daunting part, he says, was the volume of writing required over the six hours of the two exam papers.“The speed was challenging. But I got there in the end . . . I did a lot of competitive running in my earlier days and you learn about stamina and willpower. I think that stood to me.”Personal effortThe State Examinations Commission said it could not confirm whether Mr Lynam is the oldest student to sit the exams for data protection reasons.Kathy O’Neill, director adult learning at the Crumlin College of Further Education, says Mr Lynam is probably the oldest student the college has had to date.“It’s the culmination of a great personal effort and, for Anthony, it has been transformative,” she says.“We get all sorts of students who go back to do the Leaving for all sorts of reasons, such as retraining to be a primary teacher foundation Irish for new citizens who want to help their children in school . . . these days, you only need one subject to fulfil the need to progress to further study.”As for Mr Lynam, he is full of praise for the support he received and would encourage anyone to return to education.“It’s been a great journey, a great experience. I feel very enriched by it all. I wasn’t much of a reader before, but’s got me reading,” he says. “Now when people talk about the Leaving Cert or exams, I know exactly what they are talking about.”"},{"url":null,"title":"a baby born today the climate and their future","story":"Life-support systems that nature provides – an intertwined web that sustains humans, plants and animals – are at risk of unravelling in a matter of decades.Deforestation, intensive agriculture, overfishing, development and other human activities are breaking the bonds that combine to make a healthy planet. Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3919948.1560095885!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"when it comes to litter where is ireland s black spot","story":"November 5th, 2018: Swimmers at the Forty Foot in Sandycove speak about the 70 kgs of “tooth-pick sized” plastic that were recovered from the area at the weekend.

Photograph: Tom HonanThe Almost a quarter of Irish towns assessed by An Taisce have been found to be littered, with Ballymun in Dublin classified as a black spot after inspectors recorded one of the worst reports since the ranking system was created.The heritage group inspected 40 Irish towns in accordance with international grading standards as part of the Irish Business Against Litter (Ibal) anti-litter league. It found 31 of them, or 77 per cent, to be clean, which was in line with recent surveys.However, Ballymun was deemed a litter black spot and placed at the foot of the rankings. Ibal said it was the first time in three years a town had received a litter black spot classification and that Ballymun recorded one of the worst results since the league was founded 17 years ago.The car park at Ballymun Shopping Centre was described as “a complete eye sore right in the centre of Ballymun”, while Balbutcher Lane was not just littered, but subject to dumping. The same was said to be true of Shangan Road.“As the Ballymun and other results show, there has been little if any progress in disadvantaged areas of our cities,” said Ibal’s Conor Horgan. “The gap between these areas and the commercial high footfall commercial city centres is widening.”Kilkenny topped the rankings for the fifth time, ahead of Athlone and Killarney and the centres of Dublin, Cork, Galway and Waterford were cleaner than previously, with only Limerick failing to achieve “clean” status.Portlaoise, Tralee and Letterkenny enjoyed their best-ever showings in the survey and were among 14 towns deemed cleaner than European norms.Dublin’s north inner city was said to be “seriously littered”. Ibal said changing domestic waste collection from plastic bags to conventional bins could significantly improve cleanliness in the area.“Bags are an antiquated form of collection which lead to dumping,” said Mr Horgan. “All too often they are left out for long periods on the street and attract other people’s waste.

Photograph: Robert DalyOjoGettyA ban on under-18s being treated with Botox or dermal fillers is being investigated as part of plans to tighten up regulation of cosmetic procedures in the State.Minister for Health Simon Harris has asked his officials to see if there is a need to further regulate the sector amid growing evidence internationally that teenagers are accessing cosmetic treatments.Mr Harris wants his department to outline the public health risks for men and women using Botox and fillers and to explore how these risks can be communicated to the public.“While the profession and the products are regulated, I am conscious that this is an industry that is continuing to grow and, particularly worryingly, it is targeting young men and women,” he said.“Many of these products are being offered cheaply, without prior assessment of the person and by professionals who are not regulated in this country.“This is not an issue solely confined to Ireland but one that I believe we need to address as a matter of priority. This cannot be an area that goes unregulated or unsupervised.”The department, which was instrumental in the ban imposed in 2014 on under-18s using sunbeds, is now looking at whether a minimum age should be imposed on the use of certain cosmetic products.Mixed regulationCosmetic procedures are currently regulated through a mix of professional regulation, applying to doctors and dentists supplying the procedures, and product regulation. Some products, such as medicines containing the botulinum toxin, are prescription-only, while others are treated as medical devices.Botox, which is used to smooth wrinkles, has to be administered by a medical doctor, but dermal filler products are classified as medical devices and can be injected into the face by practitioners without a medical degree.From next year, products used for aesthetic purposes that currently do not fall within the definition of a cosmetic product or a medicine, including dermal fillers, may be classified as medical devices under new EU legislation.Under patient-safety legislation being prepared by the department, public and private hospitals, and providers of high-risk healthcare activities – including some cosmetic procedures – taking place outside a hospital will require a licence to operate.The Health Information and Quality Authority will also be given wider powers to monitor private hospital and inspect the provision of cosmetic procedures and other services."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeMichael Gove suffers new blow as Amber Rudd endorses Jeremy Hunt for Tory leadershipGreenpeace activists stage climate protest on BP oil rig as it is towed out to sea in ScotlandBarking fire: Investigation launched after blaze destroys 20 flats in east LondonNurse behind first IVF baby was snubbed for position on plaque honouring the achievementNight owls can retrain their body clocks in just three weeks, study findsCPS accused of dropping rape cases if they think jurors will be prejudiced against the victimBlood donations from men plummet as NHS says they are less motivated by altruism than womenBinge-watching TV viewers \u0026#39spend more than eight hours\u0026#39 glued to favourite showsEmily Thornberry faces axe from Labour frontbench, amid allegations she overstepped mark on BrexitTheatre cancels LGBT play after two cast members were subjected to homophobic attack in the streetIran-linked terrorists caught stockpiling explosives in north-west LondonComment: Sajid Javid secures backing of three Home Office ministers who hail him as \u0026#39outstanding candidate\u0026#39New prostate cancer test will give men \u0026#39peace of mind\u0026#39 that they will never develop the disease, scientists sayEurope has not faced up to the threat of HizbollahBoris Johnson\u0026#39s radical plan to slash income tax for 3 million by raising 40p rate threshold to £80,000Michael Gove\u0026#39s ex-flatmate says he never saw him take cocaine amid claims of a \u0026#39double life\u0026#39 Michael Gove under pressure for overseeing teacher drug bans in the wake of his cocaine confession Investigation launched after teenager\u0026#39s prize-winning hens stolen from their cages at agricultural showComment: Economic innovation will turn the UK into a clean, green powerhouseFamily in UK targeted on social media after being mistaken for animal abusers at US farmCocaine use should disqualify you from becoming an MP, majority of the public believeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

In June 1944, as a Switchboard Operator recently trained in the new technology of VHF radio, 17-year-old Marie Scott practically skipped down all 350 of them, deep into the tunnels underneath the cliffs of Fort Southwick.Living, working and sleeping in the tunnels was not very pleasant: eight-hour watches in a 24-hour duty, then off for a day. For the staff of the Naval Command headquarters just outside Portsmouth, the fetid air and lack of natural light underground meant the steps provided welcome exercise on their way back to the surface.Day and night meant nothing to Marie and her colleagues: the wireless operators, plotters, planners and telegraphists from across the services, who sat at their stations in the windowless offices or slept in small, cramped rooms on three-tier bunks.Even so, they knew their hardships were nothing compared to the men they would be speaking to on the other end of their wireless sets. They’d been informed on June 4 that a big operation was planned for the next day, but hadn’t been told why a 24-hour delay meant that it would now be starting on the sixth.Marie Scott at Southwick House, Portsmouth. She was a 17-year-old switchboard operator on D-DayWhatever was happening up there on the surface, in the air and on the sea off the south coast of Britain, the nine WAAFs, Wrens and Auxiliary Territorial Service personnel in Marie’s section knew this was no rehearsal it was the real thing.“I grew up on that day,” Mrs Scott says. “I became aware of the reality of war.”General Dwight D Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of Allied Expeditionary Forces in Europe, had arrived in Southwick House on June 2 to establish his headquarters for the invasion. Chosen because of its proximity to the port, and to the underground naval command headquarters dug into the cliffs, Southwick House had been requisitioned for the Royal Navy’s navigation school earlier in the war.The date for D-Day was dictated by the weather. With a full moon and suitable tide, the period June 4 to 7 was optimal, with a few days from the 18th as Plan B.If they didn’t go in June, the next suitable tide was not until September and by then the secret would have undoubtedly slipped out. The Germans knew an invasion was coming - the mass of Allied vehicles, manpower and ships meant it was only a matter of time - but they didn’t know where, and they didn’t know when.But there was a problem. The British and American meteorologists had different ways of doing things and couldn’t agree on the most suitable date. The situation was not helped by the fact that James Stagg, Eisenhower’s chief weather adviser and a civilian later given the notional rank of Group Captain in the RAF so as to be more readily accepted by the military, was actually a geophysicist.An intense rivalry had developed between him and the weathermen. Meteorology at this time was more art than science and there hadn’t been any significant advances in the subject since the First World War.  On June 4 Stagg recommended to Eisenhower that the weather was so bad, with high wind and cloud cover, that D-Day, planned for June 5, should be postponed.Eisenhower asked his component commanders their view. “Chancey,” said Air Chief Marshal Leigh Mallory, the air commander. “Do-able but risky” thought Sir Arthur Tedder, Eisenhower’s deputy. General Montgomery, the overall ground force commander, in charge of all British, American and Canadian troops (and later Polish forces) was unequivocal in his belief they should launch.Eisenhower made his decision. “OK, we’ll go,” he said to Stagg. A signal sent to London and Washington stated ‘Halcyon plus five’ (Halcyon being the code word for June 1). The invasion was on.Despite knowing an attack was coming, the remarkable success of Operation Fortitude, under General George Patton’s First US Army Group, had convinced the Germans that any attack in Normandy would be just a ersion for the main assault at Pas-de-Calais.General Patton was considered by the Germans to be the best allied general and therefore certain to be the commander of the coming invasion. He based himself in Kent, with real soldiers bolstered by dummy equipment available for the eyes of German intelligence.Operation Fortitude worked so well that even after D-Day the Germans held many of their best troops in the Calais area expecting a second invasion.Further afield Britain’s secret agents, the Special Operations Executive (SOE), were doing their bit. In some areas, the Germans were using carrier pigeons to send messages. The SOE put birds trained to fly towards Britain in German army pigeon lofts so the messages were delayed or simply disappeared. The French resistance blew up the radio land lines, to force the Germans to use other means of communication which, with Enigma cracked, enabled the Allies to listen in.Pigeons had a vital role in the war Dummy paratroopers were dropped across Seine-Maritime, Calvados and Manche and an SAS team, parachuted into the Cotentin peninsula five miles west of Saint-Lo, installed loudspeakers to play combat noises, including explosions and the sound of soldiers swearing.  The RAF’s 617 Squadron - made famous by the Dambusters raid in 1943 - dropped strips of metal foil known as ‘window’ miles away from Normandy. German radar operators were fooled into thinking they were seeing an approaching naval fleet, where in fact there was none.The deception plan was working. Just as well, there was no way now of stopping the vast armada of ships and aircraft departing on the biggest operation of its kind ever mounted what Eisenhower later called “the great crusade”.Having made his decision, Eisenhower was rendered temporarily powerless as the massive machine of war stirred into action.On the afternoon of June 5, he had been driven to Greenham Common to visit the troops of the 101st Airborne Division, a force expected to have one in every two men killed, wounded or captured. He handed out cigarettes and talked to them about fly fishing a photo from the time captures him with hands aloft, as if explaining how to cast.Eisenhower gives the order of the day to US paratroopers on June 6, 1944 Returning to Southwick House he stood on the ridge to watch the deployment. It was said to be the only time he showed emotion a certain moisture around the eyes. New challenges would face him in the future, but nothing ever again on the scale of D-Day.Just after midnight on June 6, paratroopers from the British 6th Airborne Division, the first of 23,400 airborne troops, jumped into Normandy. The German artillery battery at Merville needed to be silenced before it could fire on to the beaches where British and Canadian forces were due to land a few hours later. Two bridges over the Caen canal and the River Orne were to be seized to prevent German reinforcements arriving from Calais.The glider-borne assault on the bridges was so successful - 15 minutes from landing to capture - they were renamed Pegasus and Horsa Bridges, after the emblem of British airborne forces and the gliders they had flown in on.Lieutenant Herbert Denham ‘Den’ Brotheridge, killed just after midnight on the 6th while leading a charge to seize Pegasus Bridge, was the first allied soldier killed on D-Day.Pegasus Bridge: No 1 glider (in background) piloted by Jim Wallwork landed within feet of the planned targetAt 02:40 Field Marshal von Runstedt, commander of the German Army in France, was told of fighting in Normandy, but still believed the main invasion would be at Pas-de-Calais.Although the potent 21st Panzer Division was available, Hitler was asleep at Berchtesgaden and his staff were too nervous to wake him up to order the reinforcements, as they still thought the fighting was a ersionary raid.It was another two hours before Von Runstedt ordered the 12th SS Panzer Division into action, but his decision was rescinded at 06:30 by General Jodl at the Armed Forces High Command, who still wanted to wait for Hitler to wake up.Assault routes into Normandy - DDAYIn the early hours of June 6, the invasion fleet arrived at the assembly point south of the Isle of Wight called Area Z - better known as Piccadilly Circus - and passed through a lane cleared in the German minefield which extended to Norway. It then turned south, towards the Normandy beaches.At 04:30, an hour after the assault troops had started cross-decking into the landing craft far out in the English Channel, struggling to descend the nets into vessels that were pitching uncertainly below them, and just as Von Runstedt was ordering the Panzer reinforcements, two British X-class midget submarines surfaced off the Normandy coast.For the preceding two days, each craft and their five-man crew had sat silently, waiting for the invasion. Their mission: erect 18-foot telescopic masts equipped with navigation lights and radio beacons to guide British and Canadian landing craft to the beaches.Canadian soldiers from 9th Brigade land with their bicycles at Juno Beach in Bernieres-sur-Mer on D-DayAs H-Hour approached, the time of the ground invasion, rocket launcher barges started firing salvoes onto the beaches in a bid to clear the minefields. On Gold, Juno and Sword beaches in the British sector, where 61,715 British and 21,400 Canadian soldiers were to land, 20,000 rockets blasted the sand, with a similar number fired at Utah and Omaha beaches in the American sector, where 73,000 US troops would be arriving shortly.  However, Forward Observers out at sea struggled to see through the clouds of smoke and brick dust being thrown up from the coast by the naval gunfire. Consequently, much ammunition was wasted on targets randomly picked off the map. As the landing craft approached the beaches, smelling of diesel, sweat and vomit, the men geared themselves for the imminent assault unaware that much of the German coastal defence remained intact.Security around the operation had been rigid. The secret map board in Southwick House, depicting the coasts of England and Normandy and which showed all the locations of the deployed forces, covered an entire wall.Produced by carpenters at Chad Valley toys in Birmingham, the section was one small part of a larger piece that had been ordered, showing Britain and the entire European coastline from Norway to Spain.When the carpenters had erected the section they commented that the invasion was obviously planned for Normandy. “Yes,” came the answer, “and you’re going to jail.”Allowed to do odd jobs around the house by day, the two men were locked up each night. They had only planned to stay for the weekend but were kept at Southwick House until September. History does not record what they told their wives upon their return.Not even the tea ladies were allowed in. One Wren, Marsi Taylor (known as Aunt Marsi),  had worked in the headquarters throughout the war but had never seen the map room before visiting in 2014.Two bizarre security incidents had particularly concerned the authorities and show how seriously efforts to deny the plan’s discovery by German spies had been taken.In early 1944 codewords related to D-Day were revealed in the ’s crossword puzzle: Gold and Sword were dismissed as commonly-used crossword answers, but then more exotic words started to appear.On May 22 came the clue ‘Red Indian on the Missouri (5)’. The answer: Omaha, codename for the beach to be taken by the 1st US Assault Division. Then, on May 27, came Overlord, the name for the entire Normandy campaign. Coincidence? Perhaps.But on May 30 came Mulberry (the floating harbours used in the landings) and on June 1 the solution for 15 down was Neptune (the naval assaults onto the beaches). Alarm bells rang and MI5 visited Leonard Dawe, the ’s crossword compiler, who later said “they made me sweat”.Troops landing on D-Day at Sword beach. The picture was taken from a photo reconnaissance Mustang aircraft of II (Army Cooperation) SquadronThe second case involved Helen Duncan, a spiritualist and clairvoyant. She was the celebrity mystic of her day and had supposedly given seances to King George VI and Churchill. She was also a con artist who used to spit out fluid claiming it was ectoplasm, while her husband rattled the windows.She claimed she could talk to the dead through the spirit of an Able Seaman who had been on HMS Barham, a battleship sunk in the Meditaerranean with the loss of 861 men. The Admiralty was concerned as it had not released the details of HMS Barham’s loss.In the febrile and paranoid security atmosphere ahead of D-Day, Duncan was put under surveillance and later arrested after a seance attended by two superstitious naval officers who thought she might reveal the secrets of the imminent invasion. She was acquitted of fraud but found guilty of witchcraft under the 1735 Witchcraft Act and sentenced to nine months in Holloway prison.D-Day 75 years on | Read moreAt 06:30 US troops from the 1st and 29th Divisions landed over a four-mile front at Omaha beach. The US 4th Division put ashore the first of 23,250 men on Utah beach at the same time.Immediately there were problems at Omaha. Many landing craft missed their targets or were swamped in the choppy seas. Of the 29 Duplex Drive tanks (modified Shermans with floats) in the first wave, 27 sank. German resistance - from the 352nd Infantry Division - was stronger than anticipated.On one landing craft a flamethrower operator had been hit and his weapon exploded, blasting him into the sea and spewing blazing fuel over the decks. The vessel caught fire and continued burning all day, periodically lit up again by detonations from exploding 20mm Oerlikon ammunition.At 07:25 the British 3rd Division landed at Sword beach, intending to take the town of Caen and the Carpiquet aerodrome by nightfall. The seizure of the La Breche strongpoint covering the beach took three hours and cost the South Lancashires 107 men killed. On one part of the beach a solitary French girl was seen wading through the surf to help wounded men out of the water.Five minutes after Sword, Gold beach was assaulted by the British 50th Division who must hold the position to allow the two Mulberry harbours - vast prefabricated structures vital for offloading the two million troops and critical supplies - to be established.Marie Scott, manning her VHF Switchboard in Fort Southwick, was shocked when the soldiers on the beaches started radioing back. “When they passed their message you could hear gunfire, cannon fire, all the sounds of war,” she said.“Suddenly you realised that this was the reality of war. Men were dying there. And at 17, and being rather naive, I don’t think it had fully registered, until the moment I got the first message back and could hear the sounds of war.”British troops take positions on Sword beachAfter hours without a decision, and with Hitler still asleep, at 07:40 General Edgar Feuchtinger unilaterally ordered his 21st Panzer Division to reinforce the eastern beaches. Hitler woke up an hour and a half later, but regarded the news from Normandy as excellent, still thinking - thanks to Operation Fortitude\u0027s chain of deceptions - that the morning\u0027s events were a cover for the real invasion at Pas-de-Calais.The assault on Utah progressed well, even though the tide had taken the landing craft a mile south of their intended positions. Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt Jr, the 56-year-old son of the former president, was in the first wave.Meanwhile, wading towards Sword beach, in a bid to rally the men of 1st Special Service Brigade, Piper Bill Millin struck up Hieland Laddie as his Cameron tartan floated around him. The man behind him was hit and sank, but Millin kept going. Once ashore he did not run, but walked up and down the beach, blasting out a series of tunes, including The Road to the Isles. German prisoners later admitted that they had not attempted to shoot him because they thought he had lost his mind.Piper Bill Millin strikes up Blue Bonnets as 1st SS Brigade Commandos wade ashore at Ouistreham on Sword beachThe 3rd Canadian Infantry Division landed at Juno beach at 07:45, having had H-Hour delayed by 10 minutes due to rough seas. But even then some craft were late. As a result, many hit obstacles submerged by the tide and the coxswains could do little to prevent the landing craft becoming entangled. The Engineers struggled to clear a path and almost a third of the vessels were destroyed by mines. They took heavy casualties.Likewise, the situation at Omaha was becoming desperate. Vehicles were stuck in the deep water and wounded men on the beach were drowning as the tide came in. General Bradley, commander of the US First Army and in charge of the assaults on Omaha and Utah, watched the chaos from the cruiser the USS Augusta. He came close to stopping the operation and considered erting troops from Utah.Pinned down on Omaha, Colonel George Taylor, commander of the US 16th Infantry Regiment, shouted to his men: “Two sorts of people are going to stay on this beach, those who are dead and those who are going to die. Let’s get the hell out of here!” There were hundreds of bodies on the beach and floating in the water. Commonwealth personnel, nearly all British and Canadian, outnumbered the Americans on D-Day. Of the 156,000 men landed in France on June 6, 73,000 were American, and 83,000 were British and Canadian, while the Commonwealth naval contingent was twice that of the Americans. The Germans were formidable opponents, and by this stage of the war the British Armed Forces were tired, having been fighting for nearly five years. The Americans wanted to get the job done and some questioned why it was taking Britain so long. But in truth the country was almost exhausted and close to bankruptcy.In late 1943 the Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison, had told Churchill that Britain was unable to replace any battle casualties. Consequently, Montgomery was fighting the war with the Army he had, rather than the one he wanted, and morale was fragile. He was criticised after the war for excessive caution, but the priority at the time was to preserve his fighting power. He had been told by Churchill to win well and sufficient for Britain to maintain her world power status.Ron Smith was a 19-year-old electrical technician on Landing Craft Tank 947 when he left Gosport early on D-Day. He thought at first it was another rehearsal, like he was used to in Scotland, but the skipper said they were going to France instead. “Do we need a passport?” asked one of the crew.The craft landed on Sword beach at 07:30, closed up, at action stations, carrying six 80-tonne Churchill tanks, with a rocket ship behind Ron blasting the mines on the beach. “I don’t reckon a whelk could have survived on that beach,” he said.Ron Smith, who was on landing Craft Tank 947 which was sunk by shellfireRon’s landing craft was hit by shellfire. The third tank was immobilised, blocking the exit ramp, and the torpedoes on the landing craft exploded, killing a number of men on board. They managed to get off the beach but the craft was partly submerged, due to the damaged tank on the ramp, and was mistaken for a submarine on their way back to Portsmouth.Despite the shock of the action Ron, now 94, was impressed with the whole operation. “It was beautifully organised,” he said, “if you can say that in a war.”Back in Eisenhower’s headquarters at Southwick House there was a frenetic atmosphere. The map room was a hive of activity and noise, with telegrams coming in, phones ringing and signals presented to staff officers. Along one wall a huge gantry seated service men and women reporting the progress of the landings. The room was enveloped in a fug of cigarette smoke.People rushed to put things on the map - and remove them. Sybil Parker, a Wren working in the headquarters, had a Canadian boyfriend called Captain James Morley. Sybil watched as the small wooden marker denoting his ship was removed from the map board after being hit by enemy fire. She found out 10 weeks later that he had been killed on D-Day at Juno beach.Sybil Parker only learned her beloved had died when his ship was removed from the big map In the middle of it all was Eisenhower. Under huge stress, he ate little and slept even less, surviving on five packets of cigarettes a day and a lot of coffee.  Billetted in tents in the grounds of Southwick House, Eisenhower relaxed by reading cheap cowboy books and was known to have a volcanic temper that disappeared as quickly as it had flared.With his political master, Roosevelt, 3,000 miles away in Washington, Eisenhower was under great pressure from Churchill. Repeatedly dragged to Chequers, he was served tepid Irish stew, for which he developed a lifelong aversion, and had to endure Churchill’s rambling, alcohol-fuelled monologues.Churchill could be a “terrible pest” in the words of Field Marshal Alan Brooke, Chief of the Imperial General Staff. He had turned up at Southwick House unannounced on May 3 with General Charles de Gaulle. His force of nature character was unwelcome, as was his earlier insistence that the British and Canadian beaches should be called Goldfish, Jellyfish and Swordfish. He was told men shouldn’t have to die on a beach called Jellyfish. It was changed to Juno and fish was dropped from the objective names.  The first tanks enter Sword Beach, near Ouistreham Churchill’s extraordinary ability to lead was beyond question, but he did have one particularly concerning trait: a desire to be in the thick of the action. A soldier at heart, he was never entirely happy allowing the admirals, generals and air marshals a free hand and often wanted to see things for himself.His insistence on being able to watch the beach assaults for himself aboard HMS Belfast  and then set foot on the French coast presented Eisenhower with one of his more delicate diplomatic conundrums. He elected to speak to Alan Lascelles, Private Secretary to King George VI, who, in turn, took the matter to the Monarch.Winston Churchill visiting the Normandy landing beaches in France with Field Marshal Montgomery the month after D-DayThe King wrote a letter to Churchill. It read: My Dear Winston, I want to make one more appeal to you not to go to sea on D-Day. Please consider my own position. I am a younger man than you. I am a sailor and as King I am the head of all three services. There is nothing I would like better than to go to sea, although I have agreed to stay at home. Is it fair that you should then do exactly what I should have liked to do myself?He went on:  You will see very little but you will be at considerable risk. You will be inaccessible at a critical time when vital decisions might have to be taken. However unobtrusive you may be, your very presence on board is bound to be a very heavy additional responsibility to the Admiral and Captain...Churchill stayed at home.De Gaulle likewise was a prickly house guest. He had just arrived from Algiers and was livid to be told about the invasion - which his staff had had no part in planning - and that Eisenhower, rather than he, was to run a provisional government in France.That the US Treasury had been printing ‘French occupation dollars’ was a further point of tension. De Gaulle, already deeply suspicious of what he saw as an Anglo-Saxon plot to marginalise France, objected to the term ‘occupation’.It was at this point Eisenhower’s true greatness shone through. He had the ability to calm things down and was the embodiment of a coalition soldier, able to hold together a very fractious group.Eisenhower had walked in the gardens of Southwick House with De Gaulle. They smoked, and the American let the Frenchman, whom he outranked by three stars, harangue him about the plan. In an inspired moment, Eisenhower tuned and said “General, do you have any further advice for me?”De Gaulle, acknowledging Eisenhower’s patience and position, then said “Mon General, if I were you I would delay no further” and he left. Churchill departed also, in a huff because he had not been allowed to interfere in any way. He said to the staff “good luck and God speed, but I’ve been told not to talk to you,” before storming off.By early afternoon Juno, Sword, Gold and Utah beaches were largely stable and the situation at Omaha was improving, although many hours behind schedule. Lord Lovat and his Commandos, accompanied by piper Bill Millin, had relieved Major John Howard and the 2nd Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry at the Bénouville bridges. Georges Gondrée, proprietor of the Café Gondreé, approached with champagne for Lovat. He was waved away with the words: I\u0027m working.The forces of 50th Division had pushed inland four miles from Gold beach towards the town of Creully and 47 Commando Royal Marines had taken Port-en-Bessin to close the gap with the US forces at Omaha. Caen, home to 60,000 civilians, was bombed at 13:30 by over 70 B-24s of the 2nd Bombardment Division in an attempt to cut German communication lines. Despite a leaflet drop over the town earlier, warning civilians of an Allied air attack, there were many casualties.Winston Churchill talking to British and Canadian troops in Caen, in July 1944  At 15:00  the first sections of two massive artificial harbours code-named Mulberry headed across the Channel. Built of concrete and steel they were critical in the resupply of the Allied forces. It was not until 20:55 that the town of Arromanches, south of Gold beach, was captured, enabling the safe deployment of the Mulberry harbours. Reinforcements started to arrive by glider in the evening. Operation Mallard launched 250 gliders, with RAF fighter escort, in support of the British 6th Airborne Division. Denzil Cooper, then a 23-year-old Sergeant in the Glider Pilot Regiment, flew the third aircraft into Ranville at 21:00, towed behind an Albemarle. Horsa gliders were designed so that the tail could be detached once on the ground, for the easy deployment of the vehicles or men inside.Approaching Ranville in attack formation, he saw the tail of a neighbouring glider suddenly drop off, causing the aircraft to plummet to the ground. “I thought, hmm, that’s the end of them,” he said.Aerial view of pieces of the Mulberry Harbour at Arromanches, built to help troops and machinery onto the beach By the end of the day the 159,000 Allied troops, marines, airmen and naval personnel ashore had successfully established four sizeable beachheads. The invasion front remained vulnerable to German counter-attack, and there was still terrible fighting ahead, but a crucial step had been taken towards liberating Europe.Professor Richard Holmes said of the Normandy campaign: “The forces of a mighty coalition had entered the continent of Europe and mistakes not withstanding, struck a telling blow at its occupiers. They deserve our gratitude.”A month after D-Day, on the afternoon of July 11, Eisenhower found a handwritten note inside his wallet. It had been written on June 5 as he was driven to Greenham Common to visit the 101st Airborne Division.He had prepared the note in case the landings were repulsed and the operation had failed, in a bid to shield his staff from criticism.   The note said: Our landings in the Cherbourg and Le Havre area failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available. The troops, the air and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone.As the longest day - as D-Day became known - drew to a close 4,413 Allied soldiers were dead. German losses are thought to be between 4,000 and 9,000. The whole Normandy campaign lasted 77 days (Montgomery had expected 90) and resulted in the destruction of the German 7th Army and 5th Panzer Army.In total 209,672 Allied soldiers were killed, wounded or listed as missing. This casualty rate, including the Germans and civilians, was 6,674 killed a day, each day of the Normandy campaign- a rate that exceeds the attrition rate of Verdun, the Somme and Passchendaele during World War One. An infantry Platoon Commander had a one-in-seven chance of surviving longer than two weeks.Casualties and Deaths - DDAYMarie Scott is now 92, and on June 5, 2019 will be presented with the Legion d’honneur, France’s highest award, as a mark of the respect France continues to have for the men and women who helped liberate the country.Mrs Scott says the significance of D-Day dawned on her only in retrospect. “To have been awarded the Legion d’honneur was remarkable, almost unbelievable, truly overwhelming.“But in comparison to the men who landed on the beaches and were injured or died, there is no comparison.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

watching tv viewers spend eight hours glued favourite","story":"Villanelle, played by Jodie Comer, in the second series of Killing Eve Fans of Killing Eve had been forced to wait nine months for the second series.Yet so desperate were they to find out how it would unfold that within hours of its release this weekend, many had already binge-watched all eight episodes.A Radio Times survey of television viewing habits reveals that half of all viewers have spent more than eight hours glued to the box watching the same show.Three quarters admit being glued to the screen for more than four hours in one sitting.The obsession with devoting entire evenings to watching back-to-back episodes of one show began in 2013 when Netflix released the first series of political thriller House of Cards in one go.Orange is the New Black and Breaking Bad soon followed, changing viewing habits by providing unlimited access to its films and television shows.The first series of Fleabag was an instant hit on iPlayerThe cultural phenomenon is aided by key features of services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime that will automatically start the next episode of a show 15 seconds after the end of the last one unless it is switched off.The survey of 5,500 people explored how viewers consume television via on-demand and streaming services.The vast majority - 80 per cent - revealed they had lost sleep in order to carry on watching a series, while almost one in five admitted calling into work sick in order to continue with a box set binge.The research found that such habits had become such a large part of modern television-viewing that people even felt under pressure to keep up with the latest trends.Almost a quarter of respondents admitted lying about watching a show in order to fit in because everyone else was talking about it.While there are various options for watching content in the internet age, almost 60 per cent said they most regularly got their fix on the television, while around a third watch shows on their laptops and a quarter said they also use their phones.Villanelle, played by Jodie Comer, in the second series of Killing Eve Tim Glanfield, editorial director of RadioTimes, said: “The rise of the streaming giants from the US and the traditional British broadcasters adoption of streaming and catch-up services has fundamentally changed the way we consume TV.“For many, the idea of waiting a week for a new episode or a year for a new series is the exception rather than the rule in 2019, being able to discover and then devour hours (if not days) worth of one show all at once is the new norm.“The survey results illustrate that however and whenever we consume it, great quality TV will always be something that we can’t get enough of… although I cannot endorse losing sleep or bunking off work, however big that end of series cliffhanger is!”It is not only Netflix that viewers turn to for their television fix. Peter Kay’s BBC Two comedy Car Share became the BBC’s most-watched iPlayer boxset when it was released in 2015.All six episodes were shown on the iPlayer, resulting in 2.8 million requests before its BBC1 debut.Fleabag, written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, also became a hit after its release on iPlayer in 2016, having been commissioned by the online-only BBC Three strand.According to one study, nine in 10 people watch TV every week, averaging three hours and 23 minutes per day.But many experts have warned that binge watching is bad for your health, linking it to depression and loneliness as it encourages neglect of work, relationships and family.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

the world\u0027s first baby born through the pioneering technique in 1978.But Purdy, who died in 1985 aged 39, was excluded from a plaque honouring the innovators of IVF at Dr Kershaw\u0027s Cottage Hospital, despite her playing a crucial role in the groundbreaking process which has since brought six million babies into the world.Instead, it only included the names of her two fellow IVF pioneers - gynaecologist Patrick Steptoe and reproductive biologist Robert Edwards - whom she worked with at the hospital in Oldham, Manchester.Edwards wrote to Oldham Area Health Authority in 1980 asking if the plaque could be changed to include Purdy\u0027s name, which he said would do justice to the participants involved, newly-released letters from Cambridge University\u0027s Churchill Archives Centrereveal.However, administrator David Killion replied saying the plaque would read: Human in vitro fertilisation followed by the world\u0027s first successful pregnancy, was preformed in this hospital by Mr Patrick Steptoe, Dr Robert Edwards and their supporting staff in November 1977.A letter from reproductive biologist Robert Edwards asking for Purdy\u0026#39s name to be included on the plaqueEdwards protested, writing back in 1981: I feel strongly about the inclusion of the names of the people who helped with the conception of Louise Brown.I feel this especially about Jean Purdy, who travelled to Oldham with me for 10 years, and contributed as much as I did to the project. Indeed, I regard her as an equal contributor to Patrick Steptoe and myself.Andrew Steptoe, the son of Patrick Steptoe who died in 1988, also pushed for a new plaque bearing Purdy\u0027s name, and it finally appeared outside the hospital in 2015.Madelin Evans, project archivist at Cambridge University\u0027s Churchill Archives Centre, said the letters do not reveal an explicit reason for Ms Purdy\u0027s name being omitted but said it was likely because she was a female nurse and regarded as less important than male doctors.Louise Brown, the world\u0026#39s first IVF baby (pictured), said she is glad that that embryologist Jean Purdy is now fully appreciatedLouise Brown, the first IVF baby who was born on July 25 1978, told The Daily : “I have no first hand knowledge about what happened over the plaque in Oldham but it is good that Jean is now fully appreciated.It was very much a male-dominated world in 1978 and it is important the contribution of women like Jean Purdy is recognised.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

I was shocked, we got to the theatre and my manager called the police.I just feel sorry that those boys couldn’t watch the show and learn about the community rather than them being oppressive.Ms Bantavla, from east London, said her partner was left bruised with her face swollen after she was struck by a flying object.She said: Lucy was hit in the temple and went down to the floor. All I could hear was the sound of the young boys laughing.Lucy was in shock, it all happened so fast, all I can remember now is the sound of aggressive noises and seeing her on the ground.We are still going to continue with the show, now more than ever we want to tell the story of a woman who plans on coming out.LGBT people say they experience a lower quality of lifeShe added: My reaction was complete shock, what happened has made me much more way of kissing, it shouldn\u0027t be like that.The producers of Rotterdam confirmed in a statement online that the play was cancelled due to a homophobic hate crime.It read: “We are devastated this behaviour is still so prevalent, a fact which reinforces the importance of this play’s message. We are doing all we can to support the team and thank our audiences and colleagues for their support.“They have sustained only minor injuries but are hugely shaken from this cowardly, homophobic hate crime.Hampshire constabulary said: “We have received a report from a third party relating to an incident which happened on Hill Lane.“It has been reported that homophobic abuse was shouted at two women, and stones thrown at them, by the occupants of a car.”It comes after Melania Geymonat, 28, and her girlfriend Chris were subjected to a homophobic attack and robbery on a London night bus.The couple were left covered in blood after they refused to kiss on May 30 - and five teenagers arrested over the incident have been bailed.Meanwhile, it was confirmed that the play is going ahead in Eastbourne tonight (Mon), and in Manchester on Thursday and Friday.Rotterdam, by Jon Brittain, premiered at Theatre 503 in south London in 2015 and moved to Trafalgar Studios the following year.It revolves around a couple living in the Netherlands, with both characters grappling with their emerging sexual identities.Director Sam Hodges tweeted: This only makes us more determined to tell these important stories on our stages.Greenpeace activists stage climate protest on BP oil rig as it is towed out to sea in ScotlandBarking fire: Investigation launched after blaze destroys 20 flats in east LondonBlood donations from men plummet as NHS says they are less motivated by altruism than womenNurse behind first IVF baby was snubbed for position on plaque honouring the achievementNight owls can retrain their body clocks in just three weeks, study findsCPS accused of dropping rape cases if they think jurors will be prejudiced against the victimBinge-watching TV viewers \u0026#39spend more than eight hours\u0026#39 glued to favourite showsEmily Thornberry faces axe from Labour frontbench, amid allegations she overstepped mark on BrexitIran-linked terrorists caught stockpiling explosives in north-west LondonNew prostate cancer test will give men \u0026#39peace of mind\u0026#39 that they will never develop the disease, scientists sayComment: Sajid Javid secures backing of three Home Office ministers who hail him as \u0026#39outstanding candidate\u0026#39Europe has not faced up to the threat of HizbollahBoris Johnson\u0026#39s radical plan to slash income tax for 3 million by raising 40p rate threshold to £80,000Michael Gove under pressure for overseeing teacher drug bans in the wake of his cocaine confession Investigation launched after teenager\u0026#39s prize-winning hens stolen from their cages at agricultural showMichael Gove\u0026#39s ex-flatmate says he never saw him take cocaine amid claims of a \u0026#39double life\u0026#39 Comment: Economic innovation will turn the UK into a clean, green powerhouseFamily in UK targeted on social media after being mistaken for animal abusers at US farmMichael Gove suffers new blow as Amber Rudd endorses Jeremy Hunt for Tory leadershipCocaine use should disqualify you from becoming an MP, majority of the public believeMike Pompeo pledges to  \u0026#39push back\u0026#39 if life becomes difficult for UK Jews under a Corbyn governmentWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/07/15/renee-elliot-070619.jpg","title":"planet organic renee elliott sustainability wellbeing view from the top","story":"IM Subscribe  registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Serial entrepreneur Renee Elliott\u0026nbspwas the woman\u0026nbspwho kickstarted the UK’s organic food scene back in the Nineties – way before kale made its way on to\u0026nbspthe menus of fashionable London restaurants.To Elliott, health is the foundation of a person’s wellbeing. “Taking care of yourself is key,” she tells The Independent.\u0026nbsp“For some women it’s a little uncomfortable, for others it can even be agonising, it depends on how you’re built. But I know that if I go out of balance then I go into stress.“In business, life or relationships it’s about trusting and respecting yourself and your body. Essentially trust your gut, not your brain.\u0026nbspIf it tells you to do it, you should respect that, whether it’s an important business decision or sleeping more.”Elliott is as passionate about this mantra today as she was in 1995 when she opened the UK’s first organic supermarket, Planet Organic – the company that was to change not just her career but also the way that organic retailing developed in the UK.Created with Sketch.Food and drink news Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.135 Healthy living makes us more inclined to binge, research suggestsGluten-free breads, dairy-free milks and other plant-based products have been some of the most favoured foods in British supermarkets this year.235 Growing list of Vegan celebsMaking the switch to veganism is a major lifestyle choice, one that many claim can improve energy levels, lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and clear up any skin issues.

Cambridge PhD graduate-turned farmer, Adrian Izzard has used traditional growing techniques at Wild Country Organics to produce the colourful spuds, packed with healthy cell-protecting anthocyanin, which had previously disappeared from UK plates when post-war farmers were pushed towards higher-yielding varietiesOver the last 10 years, what began as\u0026nbspa shop on Westbourne Grove became a multi-million pound business.\u0026nbspPlanet Organic\u0026nbspraked in £30.6m\u0026nbspin sales last year on operating profit of £590,000 over seven stores. This year the firm is on track to book revenues of £36m.Although Elliott stepped down from her role as director in 2018 after Planet Organic was sold in a deal thought to be worth around £15m, she remains the brand spokesperson and kept\u0026nbspshares in the business.Her desire to help people lead healthier and happier lives prompted her to launch her second venture, Beluga Bean\u0026nbsp– an academy that\u0026nbspruns courses to empower women with business and life skills including how to save for your pension, deal with postpartum depression or find\u0026nbspthe right balance between your children and your business.Turning her aspirations from fantasy to reality was far from easy but\u0026nbspworking in the food industry was inevitable for Elliott.She was born in Pascagoula, Mississippi, in a home where her mother was always cooking.\u0026nbspHer father kept a large vegetable garden, which she helped out with. “It’s funny I didn’t really see this until I got older, but when I look back, food was always a big part of my family,” Elliott says.“My mum was an incredible cook and baker. Every holiday, every birthday, every graduation, it was all about the food.”As a student, Elliott went travelling in Europe and met her future husband on a night bus in London in 1985. After realising it was more than a summer fling, she settled in the UK\u0026nbspthe following year.Her eureka moment came when she stepped into an organic supermarket called Bread \u0026amp Circus – now a part of Whole Foods – on a visit to the US. Disheartened by the lack of organic presence in the UK, she decided to take matters into her own hands and bring\u0026nbspthe concept to London.“For a long time I had this theme running in my head about food not being what it should be and no one looking after my health in terms of what was available on supermarket shelves,” she explains.“America is usually ahead of the UK, so I thought nobody is doing this back home and I am going to recreate this.”At the time, Elliott was a writer for a wine magazine, so this\u0026nbspfirst step towards her professional goals started with a career U-turn.“I managed a health store for two years but other than that I had no prior business experience, I was an English major at university,” she says.“It was almost easier because I was naive. My dad once said, ‘There’s no reason you can’t do anything, anyone else can do,’ and I believed him.”It took her a year to write up the business plan, find the funding and come up with a logo before opening the first Planet Organic store on Westbourne Grove in November 1995.“Today I spend a lot of time telling my clients don’t worry about the ‘how’, paint the ‘what’ first,” she says.\u0026nbsp“A thousand little steps will lead you to success but if you start focusing on the ‘how’ from the beginning you will be paralysed.”By 1996, stories about mad cow disease,\u0026nbspBSE,\u0026nbsphit headlines in the UK and Elliott was poised to reap the rewards.The business doubled its turnover from\u0026nbsp£1.2m\u0026nbspto £2.4m,\u0026nbspso the founder knew she was heading in the right direction. “It was like chasing a galloping horse, it took up so fast we could barely keep up,” she adds.But just as business was booming, her business partner, who put in the initial equity investment, took her to court.“My business partner, who was a man from a privileged background, decided I should leave the business,” she says.\u0026nbsp“When I refused to abandon what I essentially saw as my baby, he took me to court. It was the hardest thing I ever faced, it was awful and it lasted 14 months.”To get through that period, Elliott practised self-care and read Sun Tzu’s The Art of War – an ancient Chinese military text – the core message of which is know your enemy.Eating organic food lowers risk of certain cancers, study suggestsCould co-operative shops be the answer to expensive organic foods?Pesticides cause brain damage and organic food is the future, says EUThe damage done by neonics makes the case of organic foodOrganic food healthier than farmed products, says new research“I slept, I stopped drinking and I meditated – essentially I prepared,” she says.\u0026nbsp“I was a very good student at school, so I prepared ferociously and I won.”After a decade\u0026nbsprunning the business, she felt like it was time to step down. “I had three kids, which I thought I’ll never do because the responsibility freaked me out,” she explains.\u0026nbsp“I knew\u0026nbspI would either have to hire a nanny or hire a CEO to run the business. It was an awful choice to make and I didn’t see it coming.“A girlfriend of mine told me, ‘Planet is more than 20 years old, it’s grown up now, it has your values,’ and that helped to step away.“But having children does slow you down. Women need to know, they need to have their eyes open, no matter how supportive your partner might be, we often end up being the caretakers. What you give your attention to ultimately thrives. And you can’t give your attention to everything, so often as women we have to make choices.”In 2017, she launched Beluga Bean to help other women learn from her experience of building a business from scratch, being an entrepreneur and a mother, and taking care of yourself.Courses include “Launch”, which\u0026nbspworks with business concepts,\u0026nbspand “Nourish”, which teaches baking and cooking to\u0026nbspimprove your health. Soon she\u0026nbspwill also be launching “Body Talk”\u0026nbspaimed at teenagers\u0026nbspstruggling with self-esteem and self-harming due to constant social media exposure.“We’re growing slowly but I have a big vision and I’ve committed to these for the next 10 years,” Elliott says.\u0026nbsp“The academy is 50 per cent business planning and it’s 50 per cent self discovery. So it covers everything and is meant to answer questions like, ‘I want to launch this business but I also want to have kids in five years’ to ‘I want to start my company but my partner is a bit unsure’ or help younger women to budget and save after they’ve graduated and are living on their own for the first time.”A sought-after speaker on nutrition and wellness, Elliott also teaches healthy baking at the College of Naturopathic Medicine in London and frequently lectures to budding entrepreneurs on podcasts such as Secret Leaders, which features interviews and tips from key figures within the UK tech and creative industries.“My motto in life is learn, earn, return and there’s a part of me that’s about giving back now and supporting others on this journey, because I’ve been there and done that.“These tools weren’t available when I started Planet, and it’s so nice to walk that journey with someone supporting you –\u0026nbspbecause it’s scary and you’re alone a lot of the time, self-esteem can be a problem.“When I launched Planet, my inspiration was The Body Shop founder Anita Roddick – but it’s not like there were many other examples of successful female entrepreneurs out there.”How does she balance it all? “Having fun every week and finding time for myself is key,” she says.\u0026nbsp“I dance and I walk every day.“That balance for me is critical. We often talk about destination but your goal point is always moving. This was my error with Planet – it was always about the next step. But you need to have fun and take care of yourself today because you don’t always know what the future will bring.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Brexit is greatly exacerbating sector’s problemsClick to followThe IndependentFord is set to close its engine plant in Bridgend next yearSo it’s goodbye Bridgend. With carmaker\u0026nbspFord shutting its engine plant down there, at the direct cost of 1,700 jobs, not to mention all the roles that will be lost in the supply chain, the future for the town looks bleak.\u0026nbspAll that talk about the\u0026nbsp“special relationship” with the US with Donald Trump in town and yet South Wales is losing out to Mexico.\u0026nbspThat’s where the cost advantage lies.\u0026nbspFord to close Bridgend plant in 2020 with loss of 1,700 jobsFears Ford factory could close costing 1,500 jobsFord warns no-deal Brexit will force it to reconsider UK presenceFord is apparently saying it isn’t Brexit. And maybe Bridgend would have been doomed without it. But the company has previously warned that it would have to consider its UK presence in the event of no deal.The problem with Brexit\u0026nbspis that it imposes a cost penalty on every manufacturer in Britain.\u0026nbspThat penalty is theoretical at the moment because we aren’t yet out of the union. But companies like\u0026nbspFord have to look years into the future and without any clear idea about how it will all end up, they’re reliant on worst-case scenarios, such as the imposition WTO style tariffs on goods going in either direction.\u0026nbspWhere the decision on a plant is a marginal one, and even a not so marginal one, Brexit will inevitably tip things over the edge. There is clear evidence that it is already playing a deeply detrimental role when it comes to decisions about investment\u0026nbspmanufacturers are making.Earlier this week,\u0026nbspEY’s regular report into foreign direct investment found a\u0026nbsp35 per cent fall in the money coming into UK manufacturing when compared with 2017. The most recent set of Purchasing Managers’ Index figures showed the sector is now shrinking as the wider economy stagnates.The GMB union, which is doing its best to support its members through what will be a miserable process, says 500,000 manufacturing jobs have gone over the last decade.\u0026nbspMany more redundancies are pending. There are Jaguar’s woes, the closure of Honda’s plant in Swindon, the Sword of Damocles hanging over British Steel.\u0026nbspSet against that, the government’s much-vaunted industrial strategy would be considered a miserable failure except that, as events have rather served to prove, it doesn’t really have one.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

It is still an important part of the UK economy. Particularly in certain specialist areas, Britain is rather good at it, and it still provides thousands of well-paid jobs in places where there aren’t many of those to be had, where there aren’t many alternatives. Places like Bridgend.\u0026nbspTo avoid more of them being plunged into the horror facing that town, this government, or more likely a future one run by people with a little more concern for working people and their jobs, needs to do more than just talk about an industrial strategy. It needs to heed the\u0026nbspGMB’s call for action.\u0026nbspThese events don’t\u0026nbspjust hurt the economy. They\u0026nbspserve to widen the alarming cracks that have opened up in British society, cracks that are being exploited by some very unpleasant people.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Given that many of the people who incur them are under financial stress, that can only be seen as welcome development.\u0026nbspThis sort of policy work can take time (overdraft fees have been a sore point for years), but the FCA is, as a rule, fairly good at it.\u0026nbspCampaigners I have spoken to have also given it high marks for the work it has been doing on financial exclusion, for example. And prior to its overdraft reforms it had capped the interest rates imposed by payday lenders and followed up by clipping the wings of the rent to own sector.\u0026nbspSo, good at policymaking bad at supervisory practice?\u0026nbspThe criticism faced by the watchdog has extended beyond the Woodford mess, about which it could argue that such funds sometimes underperform and investors’ assets are still there. They’ll be able to get their money out once the fund\u0027s illiquid holdings\u0026nbspare sold, albeit probably at a substantial discount.\u0026nbspTake the collapse of bond firm London Capital \u0026amp\u0026nbspFinance, whose unregulated mini bonds left thousands of people out of pocket. It has led to the creation of a judge led inquiry which will, among other things, consider whether the FCA should have intervened at a much earlier stage.\u0026nbspThe regulator has also taken heat over the handling of complaints from small businesses about Royal Bank of Scotland’s Global Restructuring Group, and whistleblowers at Lloyds Banking Group. And there are other such examples.Set against that is the fact that the watchdog employs 3,700 people, of whom just 900 are involved in the frontline supervision of nearly 60,000 firms. Its remit also keeps expanding. Claims management firms and funeral plans are both being added.\u0026nbspIt begs the question: Does the FCA’s apparent slow footedness stem from its failure to effectively utilise its resources? Or does it have enough?Chief executive Andrew Bailey has a case to answer on the former. A couple of years ago one of his first big decisions was to set up a windy review of its mission, which really ought to have been obvious.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

The couple spent hours pouring over sperm donor profiles, finally settling on a man with a clean medical record and few health issues in his family. He was an anonymous donor, and they knew him only by his identifying number.Cindy gave birth to a healthy baby boy. Eventually the couple used the same donor to conceive again – and soon enough they were raising two boys. When they were older, the boys found some of their half siblings by entering the sperm donor’s number into an online database. Eventually the parents of the half siblings decided to have them all take DNA tests.The results were not what anyone expected: Cindy’s boys were not related to the other children. As it turned out, the sperm bank had sold her sperm not from the man she had carefully selected, but from a completely different donor. She discovered the identity of the man whose sperm she was given and learned that his medical history was far from pristine. A grandmother had died of brain cancer at the age of 60, and a grandfather had suffered from Alzheimer’s. Another grandmother had died of heart disease.“I felt like they tainted the gene pool for my kids,” Cindy says of the sperm bank. (She asked that her full name be withheld to protect the privacy of her children.) “I didn’t choose someone who has a history of brain cancer in the family. I would never have chosen this donor. They should be ashamed to even have this donor on the website.”\u0026nbspCryos, the biggest sperm bank worldwide \u0026nbsp(AFP)There are no national statistics on the number of children born through artificial insemination each year, although some experts have estimated the number may be as high as 60,000. And no one tracks the number of people who find that the sperm they purchased is not from the donor they chose. But in the age of consumer DNA testing, the anecdotes are piling up.Increasing numbers of parents, or sometimes their donor-conceived children, are discovering that the wrong sperm was provided by a sperm bank or fertility clinic often decades after the fact. The constant trickle of cases is raising tough questions about whether sperm banks and fertility clinics ought to be better regulated.You don’t know what you’ve inherited – you could stack the deck against your own child unwittingly. It’s not the same as rape. You’re having a medical procedure. But you’re putting this stuff into your body, and I felt physically violated“These stories are extraordinarily heart-wrenching and really challenging for the law,” says Dov Fox, director of the Centre\u0026nbspfor Health Law Policy and Bioethics at the University of San Diego. “They’re also far more common than we know.“Sperm banks are very lightly regulated, and these kinds of switches or mix-ups aren’t altogether unforeseeable when you learn of the number of sperm banks using outdated methods of labelling specimens, such as pen and paper,” he explains.Melissa, a single mother in Massachusetts, discovered that she’d been given the wrong sperm by Repro Lab Inc., a fertility clinic in New York City, when her 21-year-old daughter took a DNA test. She was matched to a half sibling who knew the donor number of the anonymous man. It was not the donor that her mother had chosen at the clinic decades earlier.Sperm bank boss ‘impregnated women using IVF with his own samples’“I’d been given the wrong donor, and there’s no way I would have found out unless my daughter took a DNA test,” says Melissa, who asked that her full name be withheld to protect the privacy of her daughter. “You don’t know what you’ve inherited – you could stack the deck against your own child unwittingly,” she continues. “It’s not the same as rape. You’re having a medical procedure. But you’re putting this stuff into your body, and I felt physically violated.”Awilda Grillo, president of Repro Lab, says that the sperm Melissa was given 25 years ago was not collected by the company but came from a bank in California. “We didn’t package the sample,” Grillo says. “We gave her what she ordered.” Melissa filed a 40-page complaint against Repro Lab with the New York state Department of Health. But the department’s only finding against the lab was poor record keeping. There are few legal remedies for parents who receive the wrong sperm, Melissa learned.“I wasn’t interested in trying to sue, because I love my daughter,” she says. “Also, I’d have to sue for wrongful birth, and if there is no health issue involved, then there’s no wrongdoing on their part.”Are they doing what they’re supposed to do? Are they providing the product they promise? These are human beings that they’re dealing with. They may be buying and selling, but this is much more than a car, and it has a huge impactJennifer Cramblett of Uniontown, Ohio, filed a suit against Midwest Sperm Bank in 2014, in the Chicago area, after learning that she and her female partner had mistakenly been given sperm from the wrong donor. Indeed, the couple’s child was clearly biracial, although the donor they’d selected was white. Sperm vial numbers at the bank were written in pen and ink, and the facility’s records were not computerised, the suit alleged. But the judge threw out the case, saying it was not a “wrongful birth” because Cramblett’s child had no health problems.Chinese sperm bank seeks donors that ‘embrace Communism’ Sperm bank turns away dyslexic donors in move branded as ‘eugenics’Sperm banks using iPhone 6s to lure donors in ChinaWhile clients like her may believe that getting the wrong sperm is fraud, courts have long maintained that there is no injury if the child is healthy. “A court could say: ‘You didn’t get the donor you wanted, but how can you say that you’re worse off? How do you know that one donor is better than the other?’”\u0026nbspsays Sonia Suter, a law professor at George Washington University who specialises in bioethics and health policy.“There isn’t a legal mechanism here to address what seems to be a clear wrong,” she adds. “The problem is there’s very little regulation. There’s a potential breach of contract if you say you weren’t given the sperm you wanted, but it may be hard to prove.” Suter says that some industry observers believe a separate branch of the Food and Drug Administration should regulate the fertility industry, including sperm banks. “Are they doing what they’re supposed to do?” she asks. “Are they providing the product they promise?” These are human beings that they’re dealing with. They may be buying and selling, but this is much more than a car, and it has a huge impact.”While the FDA does regulate reproductive tissue (such as sperm and eggs), its authority is limited to preventing the transmission of communicable diseases, such as AIDS and hepatitis. It does not regulate the donor selection process, other than ensuring that basic eligibility requirements relating to health or age are met, says Stephanie Caccomo, a spokeswoman for the agency.\u0026nbspDr\u0026nbspLouise P King, an ethicist at the Centre for Bioethics at Harvard University, says that when clinics make mistakes, people who believe they were given the wrong sperm should contact the American Society for Reproductive Medicine or the FDA so that it can be investigated. “They have a duty to find out what led to this and to prevent it from happening in the future,” she says.Still, the ASRM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis a professional organisation that only suggests guidelines for sperm banks, doctors and clinics – and does not regulate them.Dr Donald Cline pleaded guilty to two felony obstruction of justice charges\u0026nbspand admitted that he lied to state investigators about using his own sperm to inseminate patients. He surrendered his medical license and was given a one-year suspended sentence. State prosecutors said they were not able to press for a tougher sentence because there were no state laws prohibiting this conduct.I can’t believe that someone, let alone a trusted professional doctor who would give off this gleaming persona, would habitually violate that most intimate experience in a woman’s life: having a childSixty people now believe this former doctor is their biological father, based on DNA testing. Matt White, 36, of Indianapolis, discovered that he was related to Cline after reading a news article about the case. He immediately realised that the clinic was the one his mother had used to become pregnant.“I can’t believe that someone, let alone a trusted professional doctor, who would give off this gleaming persona, would habitually violate that most intimate experience in a woman’s life:\u0026nbsphaving a child,” he says. White and some of his recently discovered half siblings pushed to make “fertility fraud” a felony in Indiana. The measure was signed into law by the governor last month.The law covers cases of deception that involve a medical procedure, drug or human reproductive material, such as sperm, eggs or embryos. A conviction is punishable by six months to two and a half years in prison, with a fine of up to £7,800. The law makes Indiana one of the few states to regulate donor conception. In 2016, California passed a law that offers some protections to families having children through assisted reproduction.But Fox, the law professor, thinks the laws should go further. He has proposed a new concept: “confounded procreation”. Courts would recognise the loss when reproductive choices are confounded, or compromised, by the negligence or wrongdoing of others. In an early test of this concept, the Supreme Court of Singapore in 2017 heard a case involving sperm that was accidentally switched by a fertility clinic, resulting in a couple having a mixed race child.\u0026nbspThe court described a new kind of loss – a loss of “genetic affinity” – and awarded the couple 30 per cent\u0026nbspof the costs of raising the child, about £182,900. Fox believes that this kind of legal action in US\u0026nbspcourts can help aggrieved clients fight a litany of actions and inaction committed by clinics – failing to test sperm donors for serious and highly heritable conditions, for example, or neglecting reliable methods to label sperm samples. “There’s a whole constellation of sloppy practices that have resulted in prospective parents getting children who have half of their DNA coming from people that aren’t anything like what they were told,” Fox says.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We wanted to see if there was something there.”Corden explained that, for a while, himself and co-writer Ruth Jones\u0026nbspfeared there was no reason to bring back the show.\u0026nbsp“Then, once there was, my feeling was, life’s too short,” he continued.\u0026nbsp”Fear is the absolute reason to do it.

Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.226 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face.

I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise.

And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale.

But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2426 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2526 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”.

From the\u0026nbsp50th anniversary of partial decriminalisation of homosexuality to the fifth anniversary of same-sex marriage, we have much to be thankful for. The impact of these achievements,\u0026nbspand the rate of change, from when I attended an all boys Cof E school at the height of Section 28,\u0026nbspis monumental. At the same time, analysis by the University of Manchester\u0026nbspin 2018, based on a National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles in 2010, concluded that British society may be reaching “peak acceptance” of LGBT lifestyle and people.\u0026nbspFrom a very early age I was expected to be a diligent, hard working, studious middle son but at school\u0026nbspI was labelled the gay boy, subjected to taunts and homophobic vitriol purely because of appearing effeminateHowever,\u0026nbspI am reminded of a recent conversation with a gay friend, who suggested that equality is a lofty ideal that is far from reality when taken at a societal level.\u0026nbspHis rhetoric was far more colourful than I can attest but he believed as\u0026nbspLGBT people we were still subjected to stereotyping because\u0026nbspwe live in a straight, heteronormative world that\u0026nbspignores and threatens our lifestyles.AFPGetty Images)In my work as Britain’s First Out Muslim Drag Queen and trans activist, I have striven for visibility and wider acceptance for the Gaysian community, from within my own community and the\u0026nbspwider society. Being of a British Pakistani heritage, I struggled to come to\u0026nbspterms with my identity, within myself and my family, and this was made doubly difficult by our obsession with labels.Lebanon blocks Grindr in latest attack on LGBT+ communityLGBT+ Muslims to lead Pride march with teacher at centre of protestsPrimary school to close early as anti-LGBT+ lesson protests escalateMalta named best destination for LGBT+ travellersThe\u0026nbspother boys saw me as an outcast, which had no grounding in truth. At this time,\u0026nbspI had no sense\u0026nbspof my own sexuality but in the course of being bullied\u0026nbspI grew to associate with the gay label. If everyone assumed the\u0026nbspyoung Asif\u0026nbspwas gay\u0026nbspthen it must be\u0026nbsptrue. Apart from being sexually attracted to boys I had no deep understanding of my sexuality or what I would, many years later, come to decipher as a differing gender identity.In these formative years I identified myself with the gay label because I\u0026nbspwas being oppressed by\u0026nbspit, which fits western stereotypes of effeminacy in boys as being a gay trait. In Pakistan and the south Asian subcontinent,\u0026nbsptrans identities have long been widely acknowledged, a world away from my British upbringing. It was only in my early thirties that I became fully aware of my trans identity and this only occurred when I stopped defining myself by societal standards.Cashman, comedian Rhona Cameron,\u0026nbspactivist Peter Tatchell and Graham Norton\u0026nbsp(Getty)I’ve had the privilege to come out twice. First, as a gay man, when my mother discovered my stash of LGBT scene magazines: that\u0026nbspissue of Boyz magazine\u0026nbspaltered the course of my life. For many years I\u0026nbspled a double life:\u0026nbspa public one, at school,\u0026nbsp where I was confronted with jibes about my sexuality, where\u0026nbspI could only confide in a handful of friends who had also been labelled as gay, to my\u0026nbspprivate family life, where I kept to myself. I could not tell\u0026nbspmy parents about the abuse I was\u0026nbspgetting at school for fear they would believe it and begin to also question my sexuality.Created with Sketch.Best pictures from the 2018 Taipei Gay Pride March in Taiwan Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Participants take part in the 2018 Taipei Gay Pride March in Taipei, Taiwan, 27 October 2018.Thousands of people attended the march in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan.Participants walk in the parade.The march took place ahead of a landmark vote next month on LGBT+ rights in Taiwan.On May 24 2017, the Constitutional Court in Taiwan ruled that same-sex couples have the right to marry in the state.After making its ruling on same-sex marriage in May last year, the court stated that its decision must be implemented in two years.On November 24, a public vote will be held in Taiwan on same-sex marriage.A participant of the march poses next to a wedding studio.A young woman from Chongqing in mainland China holds a fan reading free writers before the start of the march.Participants with Pikachu-styled costumes pose as they gather at the square outside the presidential office for the start of the march.Thousands took part in the parade in support of same-sex marriage.Participants in the square outside the presidential office before the start of the parade.A couple take part in the march with their baby.Members of Tokyo Rainbow Pride walk in the parade.The parade was awash with rainbow-coloured paraphernalia.A participant of the march poses with a fan.A participant from Japan holds a banner before the start of the march.A person taking part in the march waves a rainbow flag.A man, decorated with balloons and a rainbow flag, takes part in the celebrations.An American man and his Japanese partner, both wearing headbands saying \u0027Japan\u0027 in Japanese, kiss each other during the march.Thousands of people attended the annual march.Taiwan gay rights activist Chi Chia-wei attends the march.

At the height of the bullying I did not receive any visible support from teachers, who feared being reprimanded for going against the law.My\u0026nbspschool, with a 95 per cent majority Afro-Caribbean student body, and my British Asian ethnicity,\u0026nbsp also played a big part in my experience. The analysis by the University of Manchester found that BAME\u0026nbsppeople were more likely to hold negative views towards the LGBT community, particularly in the 1990s at the height of misinformation and fear about the HIVAids epidemic and governmental ineptitude.My mother once confided in me that she feared for my future, living as gay in a straight world. I remember thinking that she was worrying without reason but after many years of lived experience as a gay man – I do acknowledge her sentimentOne of my parents’ main fears, which guided their decision to take me to the GP and the local imam, was that I had learnt to be gay because I was exposed to it, from school, from pop culture. Their interpretation of religion and south Asian cultural expectations made them question my foundations – the “gay”\u0026nbsplabel took many years to be normalised and understood within my family unit.At the root of their concern was my happiness and safety. My mother once confided in me that she feared for my future, living as gay man in a straight world. I remember thinking that she was worrying without reason but after many years of lived experience as a gay man – I do acknowledge her sentiment.Tatchell\u0026nbspin Brighton at Pride 2018 (Getty Images)I recently rediscovered\u0026nbspThe Velvet Rage\u0026nbspby Alan Downs, a book I had read in my twenties at the suggestion of my then civil partner who lauded it as ground-breaking. So much of it still resonates. Downs argued that growing up gay in a heterosexual world results in the internalisation of shame, a shame gay men may strive to obscure with material success, creativity, beauty or more severe forms of escapist gratification like substance abuse.The chemsex phenomenon, when people take drugs that enhance sex and make them feel uninhibited, has become a prominent subculture within the LGBT community, which has led to the UK’s criminal and health bodies formulating policy. From personal experience I struggled with my LGBT identity and my role within a greater society.Asifa Lahore: ‘I struggled with my intersectionality as a gay, British, Asian, Muslim’ (Christine Hayter)Being of south Asian heritage and effeminate prevented me from being taken seriously. Fresh out of\u0026nbspthe Brit school, these loaded labels were a burden and affected my emotional wellbeing. After years of suppressing my creativity and personal growth, in a career that satisfied my traditional parents,\u0026nbspI created my drag alter ego Asifa Lahore –\u0026nbspmy decision to deviate from the rigid gender norm and toxic masculinity\u0026nbspI had been subjected to,\u0026nbspconsciously and subconsciously.Through Asifa Lahore,\u0026nbspI was able to express myself creatively in a physical form that better fitted society’s understanding of what was expected of an effeminate gay man. Through Asifa Lahore the drag queen, I found an art form that allowed me to subvert societal norms. But in a perverted way I was giving in to my critics, who expected that of me\u0026nbspas an effeminate gay man that\u0026nbspputting on a dress and wig would make more sense.The second time I came out, this time as a transgender woman, I felt freedom like I have never experienced before. Even as I became fully aware of my loss of male privilege and the benefits that come attached to that I felt emblazoned to live as open and authentically as I couldPerforming at cabaret venues and events throughout Britain, I would be heartbroken by the lack of POC faces in the audience, not because they don’t exist but primarily because they don’t feel they belong in these primarily gay, white spaces. The LGBT scene has become more erse but it is still very whitewashed and, arguably, has\u0026nbspracist undertones. Many POC LGBT people complain\u0026nbspof being turned away from prominent gay clubs for not looking or sounding “gay”\u0026nbspenough.I struggled with my intersectionality as a gay, British, Asian, Muslim. I\u0026nbspcouldn’t find a way to allow all these identities to co-exist. One of my first forays into the gay clubbing scene in the early Noughties resulted in a memorable conversation with a fellow clubber, a young white gay man who felt propelled to ask how I,\u0026nbspas a gay, brown Muslim man, could be dancing to Kylie. It was this and many other confrontations like these that led me to delve into my identity.Chutney queens is\u0026nbspan affectionate umbrella term used to describe drag queens who adhere to a Bollywood inspired, culturally south Asian aesthetic. Surrounded by these gregarious clubbers I felt accounted for. I belonged. Such safe spaces exist out of necessity, the need to feel represented.\u0026nbspI have opened my own club night, ‘Disco Rani’, which is a monthly Bollywood and Banghra club night that functions as a safe space for a wide cross-section of Gaysians.Similarly, we have seen a growth in BAME\u0026nbspPrides and events that commemorate our differences, supported by Stonewall but frowned upon by the old guard that question its necessity and the\u0026nbspfragmentation of the LGBT community. The harsh reality is that more work needs to be done to increase visibility and representation of all the peoples that make up the LGBT community and until then these Prides are needed.The second time I came out, this time as a transgender woman, I felt freedom like I have never experienced before. Even as I became fully aware of my loss of male privilege and the benefits that come attached to that I felt emblazoned to live as open and authentically as I could.LGBT activists\u0026nbspdemonstrate against the Supreme Court’s reinstatement of\u0026nbspSection 377, which bans gay sex in a law dating from India’s colonial era (AFPGetty)As annual Pride celebrations begin in earnest I reflect on the importance of such events. Prides are an essential part of our celebration as LGBTQ+ people and now more than ever we must continue to show up and not forget our history. Rights that are long fought for can as quickly be taken away.Visibility must continue, especially in the current climate of the Parkfield school protests and the debate of LGBT education. Such a debate highlights the fact that –\u0026nbspfor all the legal rights and privileges the LGBT community has acquired – more needs to be done. Same sex relationships deserve acknowledgement on equal footing to heteronormative relationships. Visibility is one way to ensure our presence. As Marsha P Johnson did and as Peter Tatchell and Janet Mock continue to do, so we must stand up and make ourselves heard.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time.

So allow me to make it here, because it’s actually a very good idea.Those concerns about overcrowded, creaking commuter trains are real: but they cannot be solved without HS2, or something extremely similar. The problem is that explaining why is quite complicated, so politicians haven’t really tried.Some people seem to think HS2 is about “knocking 35 minutes off London to Birmingham”. It isn’t. Yes, it will dramatically reduce journey times: the whole project will cut London-Manchester from\u0026nbsptwo\u0026nbsphours to one it takes around an hour off the journey to Scotland Birmingham to Newcastle is cut from three\u0026nbsphours 15 minutes down to two hours. Birmingham to Nottingham, which currently takes over an hour, falls to an almost ridiculous 19 minutes. One misconception is that these will be special “high-speed”\u0026nbsppremium services with higher ticket prices for rich passengers. That isn’t true – these will be the ordinary journey times between those cities, integrated into the existing network.Created with Sketch.Extinction Rebellion: Climate change protests cause chaos in London Show all 46Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester gives a thumbs up as he stalls a DLR train at Canary Wharf station in London246 City of LondonProtesters hold up traffic on Upper Thames Street in the City of LondonProtesters hold a banner as they hold up a DLR train at Canary Wharf station in LondonOfficers remove plants that were placed in the occupation of Waterloo BridgePolice officers arrive at Oxford Circus as they prepare to remove protesters during the fifth day of a coordinated protest by the Extinction Rebellion group, April 19An activist waters the plants at the occupation on Waterloo BridgeUndeterred by over 400 arrests, climate change activists continued their demonstration into a fifth day in London with a small protest at the country\u0027s main Heathrow Airport, along with the ongoing protest camps at other iconic locations around the British capitalProtesters with the words \u0027glued on\u0027 written on their hands hold hands as police officers arrive at Oxford CircusOfficers circle the lorry that serves as the central stage to the Waterloo Bridge occupation, repeating their tactic from a earlier at the Oxford Circus occupationOxford Circus reopens after being closed for days due to occupationOfficers prepare to move in on the occupation of Waterloo BridgeActivists relax on a sofa at the occupation on Waterloo BridgeBritish actress Emma Thompson talks to members of the media from atop the pink boat after police officers surrounded the boat being used as a stage as climate change activists occupy the road junction at Oxford Circus  in central London during the fifth day of environmental protesst by the Extinction Rebellion groupAn Extinction Rebellion demonstrator is carried away by police on Waterloo BridgeActivists on Waterloo Bridge have made a garden for their occupation site, April 20Demonstrators began blocking off a bridge and major central road junctions on April 15 at the start of a civil disobedience campaign calling for governments to declare an ecological emergency over climate change, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2025, halt bioersity loss and be led by new citizens\u0027 assemblies on climate and ecological justiceEmma Thompson joins the Extinction Rebellion protest at Oxford Circus.

The objective is capacity, and not just capacity for fast intercity services, either, but for those local regional and commuter services between small towns that have been so neglected. The complicated bit is explaining why that is.Britain’s railways were largely built in the Victorian era, for a different kind of travel. Today, the same lines carry a mix of express intercity trains – the kind which HS2 will take – and stopping local and commuter services, the kind people use to get to work, or pop to a neighbouring town.The colossal HS2 bill could cost the north its much-needed railwayThis mix is a very inefficient way to run a railway, for a reason that is quite obvious if you think about it: trains cannot overtake each other on the same set of tracks. They would bang into the back of one another if they tried. Not good. To get around this, local stopping trains need a large gap behind them in the timetable, so the express trains behind them do not catch up. That reduces the number of trains you can have per hour on a line, dramatically reducing its capacity for every type of service – local and express.The engineering thinking behind HS2 is to take those express services off the older mainlines, leaving them for stopping local and commuter services. When trains are all travelling at roughly the same speed on a line, you can fit a lot more in, because the gaps needed between them are smaller.HS2 will take express trains off the West Coast Main Line that links London with Birmingham and the cities of the northwest the Midland Main Line that links London with the East Midlands and Sheffield and to an extent the East Coast Main Line that goes up to Leeds and Newcastle. That frees up capacity across a huge swathe of the country for local services, and it’s the whole rationale behind the project. That the government hasn’t been explaining this ad nauseum is inexcusable.So if the plan is to improve commuter services, why not build a new commuter line instead of a new one for expresses? It wouldn’t make sense: these existing lines are already good for slow trains, and they go into the centres of towns and cities, which have since expanded around them. A new high-speed line for expresses can make use of engineering advances since the 19th century to speed up journeys, and doesn’t have to go into as many built up areas as a local line would, where the need for tunnelling and demolitions would make it more expensive and disruptive. And making a line high-speed doesn’t actually cost that much more, either, if you’re building one anyway. But the key point is that local services benefit, despite the new line being for express trains.HS2 will also bring other direct benefits to cities and towns that aren’t London. Northern Powerhouse Rail (stupid name) is the government’s plan to connect up the cities of the north of England with high-speed rail. It’s currently in development, but the plan, as put together by northern councils, relies on vast sections of HS2 track. Liverpool to Manchester Sheffield to Leeds and towards York and Newcastle – these bits of NPR will use parts of HS2.The government arguably made a huge mistake by starting planning on the NPR scheme so late, leaving people wondering why they were prioritising journeys to London – but with Labour and the Conservatives both committed to the project, it is likely to happen. HS2 and better connections between non-London cities aren’t an eitheror: the two projects are intrinsically linked. If HS2 is scrapped, who knows when a government will next be brave enough to try a major rail project again.In the meantime, the West Coast Main Line is filling up, and can’t wait. The reason ticket prices are a rip-off from\u0026nbspLondon to Manchester (£175 for a walk-up, one-way, anytime ticket is absurd no matter what cheap advance fares are available – sometimes you just have to travel) is because the trains are running completely full and Virgin can charge what they like and still have a passenger in every seat – and sometimes the floor. The number of passengers using the route doubled between 1997 and 2005, and it is well on its way to doubling again. The huge capacity increase that HS2 brings is a response to that.It’s understandable that people are sceptical of a project that has been badly explained, when it isn’t obvious why it deals with the biggest problems they see with the railways. That said, some criticisms are red herrings. Take the environmental impact: over the 140 miles of HS2 line, 29 hectares of ancient woodland will be felled. Sounds bad? But for comparison, a single 2.5-mile road scheme, widening the A21 in Kent and Sussex (not even a new road!), will take down nine hectares, around a third of HS2’s phase 1 total. Extinction Rebellion are barking up the wrong tree on this one far more road schemes will be needed if we can’t shift traffic to more efficient rail, and that means building more capacity. High-speed rail has also proven the greenest way to get people off short-haul flights, dominating routes like London-Paris or Madrid-Barcelona, where polluting planes would otherwise be king. Long term, it’s good for the environment. And new trees are being planted elsewhere to replace the ones cut down.Why does Britain keep making a mess of its biggest projects?Lords report recommends HS2 rethink as costs spiral ‘out of control’HS2 accused of poor planning and ‘unacceptable’ damage to wildlifeExtinction Rebellion activists camp out in trees to protest HS2‘Thousands’ of trees die on HS2 route for lack of waterAny large project will be disruptive, but compared to the other options, HS2 is actually pretty good. Consider one much-touted alternative: upgrading the West Coast Main Line with an extra pair of tracks for more capacity. There are several thousands houses built facing onto the line, and you’re going to need to knock them down to put a railway there. And it won’t be high-speed, it’ll be more expensive to do it, and it’ll be massively disruptive – not just for people losing their homes, but passengers who would face about a decade of closures and replacement buses. The more general problem with suggestions that existing lines should simply be “upgraded” (a rather vague proposal) is that there are simply diminishing returns to what you can do with 150-year old infrastructure. The West Coast Main Line already benefited from a major upgrade programme ending in 2005 it took a decade of disruption and cost over £10bn in today’s money, provided only a fraction of the benefits of HS2, and is already full. Plans to upgrade it further were abandoned because they weren’t seen as practical, and planning for a new line that became HS2 is a direct result of that process.Will HS2 suffer from cost overruns? Probably. Delays? You bet. Infrastructure projects are rarely delivered on time anywhere in the world, not least in western democracies with little things like rule of law and environmental regulation. But once they are finally delivered, nobody cares: you probably don’t even remember that the Channel Tunnel or Jubilee Line extension were fiascos in their time nobody would get rid of them now. HS2 will be the same. It won’t solve every problem with the UK’s rail network, but it is a necessary part of solving a hell of a lot of them. If it gets scrapped, in 10 years’ time people will be talking about building something very similar, and moaning that we didn’t get on with it when we had the chance.

If we are on the cusp of a good deal and we are 95 per cent of the way there on 31 October, would it really make sense to junk that progress and say we are leaving without a deal.”He said it was an “irresponsible risk” for any leadership contender to make\u0026nbspit an absolute commitment to leave by the end of October, deal or no deal, as this was likely to\u0026nbspprecipitatie a no-confidence vote in the Commons and a general election which would be won by Jeremy Corbyn.Mr Javid is promising to spend “hundreds of millions of pounds” on a technological solution to the problem of the Irish border in order to be able to quit Europe with a deal based on Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement.Despite widespread doubts that the technology exists to police millions of movement across hundreds of border crossings between Northern Ireland and the Republic, Mr Javid insisted that a system could be introduced “within a couple of years” if both sides were willing to work together.He said that a successful withdrawal agreement would create a “mini economic boom in this country” which would pay for the equipment required.Sajid Javid says UK should pay Ireland hundreds of millions of pounds to solve Brexit border deadlock (Reuters)Mr Javid, who has won the endorsement of the Tory leader in Scotland Ruth Davidson for his leadership bid, is planning to slow down the rate at which the UK pays down its deficit if he becomes PM.He said this could free up £15-£25 billion a year to spend on priorities like schools, local government and crime.Mr Javid said be believed Britain was ready for a Muslim prime minister, and said it would be an advantage to the Conservatives to select a new leader who was seen as an “outsider”, not only because of his racial background but also his working-class upbringing.He said he was “privileged” to be the first member of an ethnic minority to serve in one of the “great offices of state”.Asked if his party was ready for a Muslim PM, he said: “I think the country – not just the Conservative Party – is ready for leaders in politics from all sorts of backgrounds.“When I compare Britain to so many other countries, there is no doubt in my mind that we are the most successful multi-racial democracy in the world.”Mr Javid said he had experienced racism as a child and young man, but not since entering Parliament.“As a child, sadly, many times – these are things you don’t forget, being called ‘Paki’, being attacked by National Front skinheads, and punching back a few times,” he said.He added: “Sometimes, I do think of myself as a bit of an outsider, not just because of race but my working-class background and the schools I went to.“Sometimes there’s a strong case to have an outsider as leader because it shakes people up … One of the best ways to get your message out there is to do something different, pick a bit of an outsider.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s why we support a Final Say on BrexitAnd they challenged the invocation of wartime patriotism by the Leave camp, pointing out that it was Sir Winston Churchill who called for the creation of a “European family” to prevent another descent into bloodshed.Churchill’s words helped inspire the creation of the Common Market, which evolved into the European Union with “one main purpose - to create lasting peace by entwining our economies and societies together on a continent once ravaged by war,” they said.“Nato does not keep the peace in Europe – it keeps peace for Europe.

should be taken for granted.“We should be proud to lead in Europe, proud that our friends respect us and can rely on us.

With concern mounting that the crowded field – which at one point reached 13 contenders – would mean a long and unwieldy election period, Committee officials last week announced a new format designed to cull no-hopers early in the process.Candidates now require the nominations of eight other MPs to stand, rather than the proposer and seconder demanded in previous contests.In a first ballot of Conservative MPs on 13 June, candidates with fewer than 17 votes will be eliminated.\u0026nbspIf all receive 17 or more votes, the least popular goes\u0026nbspout. If there is a tie for last place, officials will speak to the two candidates involved to see whether both should drop out or the ballot be re-run.A second ballot will be held on 18 June, with candidates needing 33 votes or more to survive. Again, if all pass the threshold, the one at the bottom of the list will be removed.By this point, the field should have been considerably narrowed, and further rounds of voting will take place on the following days in the hope of producing a final two by Thursday 20 JuneBetween each ballot, intensive horse-trading can be expected in Westminster as the surviving candidates seek to poach one another’s supporters and hoover up the backers of eliminated candidates.The final two contenders will go through to a postal ballot of an estimated 160,000 party members around the country in July, with the result currently expected in the week of 22 July.It emerged on Thursday that there is no guarantee the new leader’s name will be announced before parliament breaks up for its summer recess, potentially denying the opposition an opportunity to test whether he or she can command a majority in the House of Commons as prime minister.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average selling price of a property across the UK in May was £237,837 after a 0.5 per cent month-to-month rise.Experts cautioned that Halifax’s index had been an “outlier” in recent months and that other house price measures have consistently pointed to a slowdown, particularly in London and the southeast of England.\u0026nbspNationwide reported that house prices fell 0.2 per cent between April and May and\u0026nbsprose\u0026nbspjust 0.6 per cent over the year.Created with Sketch.

The replacement for Jean-Claude Juncker will have to be approved by both member states and the European parliament.While one of the names being talked about will be familiar to those following Brexit, the three other front runners are less well-known in Britain:The inspiration for a TV dramaMargrethe Vestager\u0026nbsphas an impressive CV for the role (AP)Margrethe Vestager was the inspiration for the main character in Danish TV political drama Borgen – so there’s no doubt she would bring a bit of star power to the role. She’s the liberals’ candidate for the presidency, with the backing of Guy Verhofstadt – with Emmanuel Macron also naming her a possible rider.There’s never been a woman EU commission president, so Vestager would be the first – a former leader of the Danish Social Liberal party, an economy minister, and a competition commissioner, she has an impressive CV for the role.With the Danish social liberal party out of government, she may not be able to enjoy the fulsome backing from her home state that some other candidates can enjoy – sometimes a key fact at European Council meetings. But don’t rule her out.AFP)Michel Barnier is the best known in Britain as the chief Brexit negotiator of the European Commission. But he’s also been spending a lot of time recently effectively campaigning for the top job.\u0026nbspAs a Frenchman who hails in Angela Merkel’s political group, Barnier could be the compromise candidate to end the Franco-German tiff. He also has a high profile because of Brexit.He has government experience, and knows the ropes in Brussels: a former agriculture minister and EU Commissioner for the internal market. \u0026nbspWith the EU insistent that it’ll never reopen Brexit negotiations on the withdrawal agreement, Barnier’s job is basically done and he’s looking for a new challenge. Could that be leading the Commission?In March last year Manfred Weber voted against banning gay conversion therapy, unlike most of the MEPs in his party. But it clearly wasn’t a major issue for the European centre-right, because they made him their lead candidate going into the elections.Weber’s party won the European elections, so according to some people he should be the automatic next Commission president. He has Angela Merkel’s public backingBut he’s provoked opposition on the basis that he’s never held a government position he’s instead been in Brussels and Strasbourg serving as a senior MEP.\u0026nbspThe fact he is so close to Germany’s ruling party (he is a member) could also be an issue, in a union that is constantly wary of German domination. His chief critic is Emmanuel Macron, who publicly suggested he might not have the skills to be Commission president.\u0026nbspFrans Timmermans was once a conscript in the Dutch army charged with interrogating Russian prisoners of war – today he’s the centre-left’s candidate for the Commission presidency.\u0026nbspHis group didn’t top last month’s poll, but with no party having an overall majority, a ‘progressive alliance’ could give him a chance in the European parliament leg of the contest.Out of all the candidates, he has the most developed and distinctive programme: he wants an EU minimum wage, for instance, and a more developed social Europe.Currently Juncker’s deputy as first vice president, Timmermans knows the Commission inside-out, but he also has government experience: he was a foreign minister for the Netherlands’. Still stands a chance.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it hasn’t stopped since then: buoyed by the momentum of their new MEPs, ecologists are making further gains.In Germany, the latest poll shows the country’s Greens practically neck-and-neck with Angela Merkel’s conservatives, who have dominated the country’s politics for well over a decade. With the governing coalition facing a rough patch, there’s even talk that fresh early elections could put the ecologists in charge at the head of a centre-left alliance.Other countries are also seeing ecologists get in on power. In Finland, the Greens are a key part of the new governing coalition, formed on Thursday, and have even taken over the country’s foreign ministry. There are gains in places like Ireland, France and Belgium too. In Britain, they are doing as well as they have ever done in the polls for Westminster, fresh from doubling their MEPs last month.It’s worth a note of caution: public opinion can be fickle, and Green parties have surged before. Back in the 1989 European elections, Greens won 14 per cent of the vote in the UK. They didn’t quite get established as a major political force, but much of their policy and rhetoric was integrated into the big parties’ programmes out of fear they might be displaced.But there are good reasons to think that their politics will stick\u0026nbsparound this time, and that climate change might be getting the focus in our politics that it deserves – despite rows about Brexit dominating media coverage over the last few years.\u0026nbspGreens poised to overtake Angela Merkel’s conservatives in pollsThe German Greens will shape the future of all EuropeHow European newspapers reacted to the EU election resultsIn a way, the idea that “we don’t pay enough attention to climate change”\u0026nbsphas become a powerful political idea in itself – it is self evidently true, and a powerful recruiting tool for ecologist movements and green parties, who give the issue the time it deserves. \u0026nbspThe recent Extinction Rebellion protests\u0026nbspand associated climate change school strikes, which have sprung up across Europe – and play off this very idea – have massively raised public consciousness of environmental issues to never-before-seen levels.\u0026nbspA YouGov poll series of UK voters’ unprompted political concerns shows those mentioning the environment as an issue rising slowly and steadily from 2016 onwards, and then spiking after the Extinction Rebellion protests started in 2019 to 27 per cent. The spike surpassed a previous short-lived spike to 24 per cent during serious winter flooding and storms in 2014.If there are two things we can expect more of, it’s extreme weather and climate protests. If those things drive concern about the environment, that’s fertile soil for ecologist politics.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A participant dances while holding a large rainbow flag during the Athens Gay Pride.

Internationally, he is doing well. We have no real need to find a new home,” he concluded.Elections aside, tensions between secular and religious communities have flared over the last few years and will continue to do so as the community expands, analysts predict.Haredi\u0026nbspJews during a demonstration against Israeli army conscription in Bnei Brak, near Tel Aviv, in\u0026nbspNovember\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)The Haredim, according to the Israel Democracy Institute’s (IDI)\u0026nbsplatest report, make up 12 per cent of the country, but by 2065 will account for a third of Israel’s overall population.Just last month clashes between the Haredim and the security forces erupted in Jerusalem because the Eurovision finals were held on a Saturday, which violates the Sabbath.Haredi protesters regularly come to blows with the police over shops, shopping malls and car parks being open on a Saturday. \u0026nbspThis has sparked rival clashes between the police and angry secular people\u0026nbspwho have held their own rallies in Ashkelon and Ashdod, against the closure of shops for religious reasons over the weekend. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspUnderscoring these tensions is the accusation by critics that the ultra-Orthodox are a massive burden on the state.They say the ultra-Orthodox have large impoverished families that often rely on state stipends, while contributing less to the labour force and so paying less taxes.Shaarim neighbourhood in\u0026nbspMarch\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)Around half of Haredi men of working age are unemployed, according to the IDI, as many choose to opt for full-time study of the Torah instead. Only 10 per cent of non-Orthodox men of working age are jobless.Although the Haredi employment rate is steadily increasing, those that do work often have low-paid part-time jobs. Nearly 50 per cent of the ultra-Orthodox live in poverty.The other sticking point is the draft. Since Israel’s founding, members of the ultra-Orthodox who are in full-time religious study are allowed to defer and then ultimately secure lifelong exemption from military conscription.Orthodox leaders fear full integration into the military, where men and women mix, will undermine a religious lifestyle.In recent years there has been around a 50 per cent increase in numbers of young\u0026nbspHaredi\u0026nbspmen signing up. There are\u0026nbspmore than 7,000 Haredi soldiers currently enlisted in the army, according to a Knesset Research and Information Centre\u0026nbsp(RIC) report from last year.Shachar Kachol\u0026nbspultra-Orthodox Jewish unit prays at a synagogue\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)But many believe it is unfair that the Haredi are not punished for avoiding military service.\u0026nbspOver the last few years there have been fierce battles over changes to the conscription law, including the introduction of Haredi enlistment quotas and sanctions for a failure to meet them.That battle over that wording came to a head as Netanyahu was building his coalition.According to Lieberman\u0026nbspthe Haredi parties, who hold a total of 16 seats, would not budge on his demand that quotas be increased.But Haredi members of the Israeli’s parliament the Knesset (MKs) say this is not the case, and Lieberman’s position was not an ideological one but a personal one.“There was no real negotiation with us\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspit wasn’t a case of he said no, and we said yes, it was a game,” Mr\u0026nbspPindrus told The Independent.“I don’t think it has anything to do with the ultra-Orthodox parties, this was an argument between Mr Lieberman and Mr Netanyahu, who he hates.”Yisrael Beiteino party leader Avigdor Lieberman last month\u0026nbsp(Getty)A senior source with Shas, another main ultra-Orthodox party, echoed his words.“MK Avigdor Lieberman wanted to bring down Netanyahu,” the source said.“Shas members are convinced that the draft law is not the reason for the elections, but rather purely personal reasons were behind Lieberman not joining the Netanyahu government.”Both parties also denied\u0026nbspthat they were interested in imposing ultra-conservative values on Israel but rather their aim in the upcoming elections was to “keep the status quo”.It is noticeable that a recent call for the country to be run by religious law was not made by ultra-Orthodox politicians but by the United Right, an alliance of far-right parties.As Rabbi Pfeffer pointed out, the Haredim would not “touch such an explosive subject”.No one can make a right-wing coalition without the\u0026nbspHaredimThat said, with a powerful number of seats, the ultra-Orthodox will likely be kingmakers in the coming elections.“No one can make a right-wing coalition without the Haredim,” Rabbi Pfeffer concluded.“It is difficult to see a coalition that won’t have them as a tipping point.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Does Jeremy Corbyn know nothing of the British people Millions find it mind-boggling that he can happily break bread with Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA but refuses to share a state dinner with the President of the United States.Corbyn has spent so long in the self-loathing sewer of the hard Left that he has lost sight of a simple truth — most British people have a deep and profound love for this country.This week was a reminder that we have so much to be proud of. A nation looked at that dwindling band of brothers who stormed the beaches of Normandy and felt nothing but gratitude for their sacrice.There is an instinctive patriotism in our people that Corbyn and his Marxist muppets simply do not understand or share. Labour may have clung on to their seat in Peterborough by the skin of Corbyn’s dentures, but the virtue-signalling old booby never looked less like a potential Prime Minister.The oldest student in town does not look ready to form a government. He looks ready for a care home. The compulsive halo-polishing goes down a storm on social media, Mr Corbyn. It just doesn’t work in the real world.If the day ever comes when Corbyn is drooling on the doorstep of  Downing Street, is he only going to do business with people he approves of  How lonely he will be!GEORGE MICHAEL was the most generous of men. When we wrote his autobiography together, we innocently shook hands on splitting the profits -. But a ghost writer does not usually get the same payday as the global superstar with his name on the front cover.When we wrote our book, George was coming off the back of his first solo album, Faith, and was possibly the biggest star in the world. His American managers confidently assured my agent that our - deal was never going to happen. But it did – because George Michael insisted on it.He had given his word and we had shaken hands. George didn’t care about money. He cared about friendship.  So it was interesting to see how George’s last will and testimony ided his £.million fortune.Among those included are George’s -year-old dad, Kyriacos, his sisters Melanie and Yioda, and his friends Shirlie Kemp and David Austin. Those who didn’t make the cut included his lovers Kenny Goss and Fadi Fawaz, and his old Wham! buddy, Andrew Ridgeley.But Kenny and Fadi enjoyed the good le at George’s side for many years while Andrew has a joint songwriting credit on Careless Whisper, which has been worth around £million in royalties. Not bad, as Andrew was never particularly known for his songwriting genius.George probably felt he had taken good care of Kenny, Fadi and Andrew in le. George could be stubborn, self-destructive and self-obsessed. But he was a beautul man. And he had the biggest heart in the world.THEY are all queuing up to kick Anthony Joshua while he is down. Tyson Fury initially made sympathetic noises when Joshua got battered on his American debut by roly-poly Andy Ruiz Jr, a - underdog who resembles Homer Simpson’s body double.But now the Gypsy King has joined the sadistic joy in Joshua’s humiliation and recommends AJ, “never shows his face in public again”. Madison Square Garden was a catastrophe for Joshua.He was beaten up by a chubby chops who was such a late booking that his name did not even appear on the tickets.  But Ruiz was always more than a Snickers addict. Before Joshua, he had fought  times and only lost once. Ruiz was never going to be a walkover for Joshua.But AJ should have found a way to beat him. And such is the brutal nature of boxing that Joshua now needs to win a rematch with Ruiz Jrhe is to salvage his career.Joshua seemed strangely off in New York, distracted and uncertain, absent-mindedly pushing out his gum shield during the ring walk, weirdly smiley after the ref waved off the fight.  But Joshua has been a great advertisement for British boxing.And there is no shame in losing a boxing match. Muhammad Ali lost five times. Floyd Mayweather never lost. Now you tell me – who is the greater man SIOBAHN PRIGENT is the woman seen screaming “Nazi scum!” at a lone Trump supporter, then cackling with sadistic delight when the mob splatters the POTUS fan with a milkshake.Some social media users say that it is wrong to mention Prigent’s generous girth when commenting on her repulsive behaviour. Fat-shaming, they call it.  That’s rich!It was the protesters who made a great show of flying their big-bellied, fat- bottomed balloon.Sothere is fat-shaming being done, Siobhan Prigent’s side started it.IN a week of heroes, the bravery of one little girl shone brightest.Harmonie-Rose Allen lost her arms and legs to meningitis one month before her first birthday.It was my honour to know quite a few war veterans.They have all gone now, but every one of them would have saluted the courage of this incredible little girl.MILEY CYRUS protests abortion bans in some US states by posing with grapefruits over her bare breasts.“Don’t f*** with my freedom!” warns Miley.I HAVE my doubts about the remake of Worzel Gummidge with Mackenzie Crook playing the lead scarecrow.Jon Pertwee’s Worzel had a kind of raggedy, grandfatherly charm.This new Worzel looks like one of the undead coming to get you in Pirates Of The Caribbean.Who would have thought that Worzel Gummidge would ever lose his looks Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She had been trying to die for a long time. Euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal in the Netherlands.Noa asked the Levenseinde end-of-le clinic in The Hague two years agoshe could be considered for euthanasia or assisted suicide but they — rightly — refused.She told De Gelderlander newspaper in December: “They consider that I am too young to die. They think I should finish my trauma treatment and that my brain must first be fully grown.That lasts until your st birthday. It’s broken me, because I can’t wait that long.” No one, surely, could read those words without agreeing that yes, she was too young to die. Right Most of us have enough le experience to know that, no matter how bad things are, or seem to be, dark clouds can hang around — but they do sht.Things change. Hopelessness gives way to hope. And dark often eventually becomes light. But Noa didn’t believe it.There is no doubt at all that her young le had been incredibly dficult. She’d had extensive treatment for depression and anorexia, and had tried to kill herself several times.She had been sexually assaulted at the age of  and raped at . She was so traumatised she didn’t want to live any more and, after repeated hospital stays, decided to stop treatment earlier this year.In what she referred to as a “sorrowful last post” on Instagram, Noa said she had “stopped eating and drinking for a while now, and after many discussions and evaluations, it has been decided to let me go, because my suffering is unbearable”.A hospital bed was set up in her parents’ home and last week she refused all food and fluids after her parents and doctors reportedly agreed not to force-feed her.It is pretty much impossible for most of us to understand quite how desperate, resigned, despairing this woman’s parents must have been to have facilitated their daughter’s voluntary death.They must all have felt sure that there was no alternative. But it’s also hard to resist the urge to challenge that notion.There are so many examples of people — from Maya Angelou to Malala Yousafzai to JK Rowling — who have overcome adversity to make a huge success of their lives.I know many people who have overcome very dficult, challenging and dark times as teenagers who have gone on to create fulfilling and happy relationships and live rewarding and successful lives.I think it’s fair to say that, as a teenager, it’s impossible to imagine the future. It’s all too easy to be so mired in the dficulties of the present that you feel you will be stuck there for ever.Without in any way diminishing Noa’s suffering, I do know there were things that felt to me like a crisis at  that I barely now recall.I would take the view that it’s possible to get over even the most dficult challenges — evenit involves temporary defeat, sometimes total failure, it is how you react that sets your path.The big question that this story raises is, should we be allowed to choose to die  Ultimately, I think the answer to that is yes, we should. But does anyone know enough about living at the age of  to choose to die  I don’t think so.IT IS striking that this week a new Lancet study confirmed what many of us already know: Self-harm among young women and girls is rising at an “alarming” rate.What on earth is happening to our young people  Our young women in particular. What is the cause of this epidemic of self-loathing, self-harm, self-destruction When I was a teenager I had problems, sure, but nothing that would have driven me to harm myself.But so many parents now have to deal with their children hurting themselves as a daily reality – and my heart goes out to them. I don’t have the solution. But I do have a few theories about how to help kids thrive.Sport is really, really good for kids. It builds self-esteem and gives them another focus than themselves, their bodies, and whether they measure up to the people they follow on Instagram.Social media can be a force for good. But it can make young people feel really bad too. Help your kids to find other outlets, hobbies and passions.Talk to your kids about everything. And listen. Be un-shockable. My daughter – for better or worse! – still tells me everything. No subjects are taboo and they never have been or will be.If you accept your child for who they are, you will help them to be their authentic selves, rather than trying to be someone they are not. That is one of the greatest gts you can give them.I CONFESS to a tear in my eye watching the moment when Nicolas Mahut’s son rushed on court to console his father about losing to Leonardo Mayer at the French Open.Their hug was so heartfelt, and incredibly sweet and touching.It was a great reminder that relationships matter so much more than winning ever will.DID you hear the one about the woman who sold her husband’s £, football memorabilia for a fiver after seeing him cheating Shelly Cohen, , from Warrington, Cheshire, was sick of husband Paul putting his love of the beautul game before their relationship.When a friend texted her to say she’d seen her husband at a Manchester City match with another woman, that was it.She gathered together his prized memorabilia collection, which dates back  years, and listed it for sale on her husband’s OnBuy account.Then she flogged his £, memorabilia collection for a fiver. All I can say is: OUCH!SEEING all the state banquets this week has reminded me about my own visits to Buckingham Palace.I’ve been to white-tie events there as well as an intimate lunch with the Queen.I’ve also had dinner at Winfield House, which belongs to the American ambassador, in the same room that Trump had dinner.And they really are momentous occasions. I mean, just getting ready is fairly momentous.Although for most of them, despite the best-laid plans, I ended up rushing home from work and throwing something on.Some things I remember, in no particular order – after dinner, I really wanted to go to the toilet. But no one is allowed to leave until the Queen does, so I had to just hold on, and on, and on.I practised my curtsey before I went. That’s because when I was given my CBE by Prince William I was given so many instructions about how many steps to take to the left, right, and backwards that when the time came to curtsey I ended up doing a SQUAT!So I thought a YouTube tutorial might be a good idea. When our last course arrived – a plate with a bowl plus a cloth – I didn’t know what it was.Luckily, I was sitting next to the delightful Lord Chamberlain, Earl William Peel, who told me that the bowl was to wash fruit and the cloth was to dry it.Lastly, the Queen really is the world’s most professional conversationalist.She knew about the Olympic Stadium and football, and talked about both of them as though she was really interested.Despite all the pomp and ceremony, I was made to feel absolutely comfortable. But I definitely had more than a moment of thinking, “Pinch me, I’m at Buckingham Palace!”There is no doubt that Donald Trump’s trip was a great success. But my main take home from everything I saw was, what I wouldn’t give to have Melania’s wardrobe! Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s time we all acknowledged their hard work and their sacrice.That’s why I’m announcing today that, under my leadership, the Conservative Party will offer over four million public sector workers a pay guarantee.My Public Sector Pay Guarantee will raise their pay in line with inflation or their pay review body’s recommendation, whichever is higher, and is for all public sector workers earning up to £,. It will ensure that we both live within our means as a country, but that we don’t balance our books on the backs of public sector workers, especially those on low and average incomes.And by reducing the amount of money we’re spending on overseas aid, we can turbo-charge our Police and our schools with £ billion a year. This will enable police officers to keep us safer on our streets and means we will be providing the funding teachers are asking for so that we deliver a world-class education for our children.We have some of the best public servants in the world. It’s time to treat them with the respect they deserve so they can continue to provide the services for which we are all so grateful.It would ensure that wages rise at least in line with inflation or the recommendation of the relevant pay review body - whichever is higher - for everybody earning under £,.Last year, police got a two per cent rise, but the review body had recommended three per cent. Under the guarantee, they would have received the extra one per cent, worth up to £ a year extra for constables.Ms McVey wants to appeal to millions more voters with her brand of “Blue Collar Conservatism” - which focuses on hard-working communities.Extra cash will be pumped into schools and police by slashing £billion from the overseas aid budget.Cops would get an extra £billion, an increase of almost  per cent on currending funding.A further £billion would go into education - £billion for schools budgets, £billion for special educational needs and disability and £billion for further education.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wouldn’t wish the emotional distraught this has cause me on my worst enemy.”Mengert believes that the agents violated her constitutional rights when they allegedly strip-searched her.Her lawsuit states that she suffered emotional distress: “In particular, during the incident, Mengert experienced racing heart, shortness of breath, uncontrollable shaking, nausea and panic.”She wants, “injunctive relief requiring the [TSA] to direct its employees that they may not strip search passengers to clear apparent feminine hygiene products without the further heightened suspicion required by law.”Civil rights lawyer Jonathan Corbett, representing Mengert, explained that she had “hugged her grandchildren goodby after a Mother’s Day visit in Tulsa… and given that she is a frequent flyer for work and has PreCheck status, expected an uneventful security search.“Instead, two screeners at Tulsa airport decided to humiliate her.

He is one of a number of candidates in the Tory leadership race insisting they could somehow succeed where Theresa May failed in striking a better Brexit deal with Brussels.The European Union has repeatedly said it would not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, but Michael Gove - seeking to get his campaign back on course after revelations over his past cocaine use - said changing the prime minister changes everything. Boris Johnson would use the £ billion orce bill to secure a better deal, refusing to hand over the cash unless improved terms were on offer. And Sajid Javid said he would offer to spend hundreds of millions on a technological solution to the Irish border question. While hard Brexiteer Esther McVey followed Dominic Raab in saying she would prorogue Parliament to leave the EU without a dealshe became Prime Minister. She accused MPs trying to prevent Brexit of tearing up  years of history. The former work and pensions secretary said it would not be her priority to suspend sittings in the House of Commons in the run-up to the October  deadline, but said she would be willing to use all the tools at our disposalshe won the race to replace Theresa May.  Brusselsapos chief negotiator Michel Barnier has stressed that the deal struck with Mrs May remained the only one on the table and a new prime minister will not change the problem.    But Mr Gove told the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show he would have a smart negotiating team led by myself and other politicians, rather than officials, explaining to the European Union what needs to change in order to make sure we honour the referendum result. We would have a full stop to the backstop, we would also have a clear approach to making sure that we have a Canada-style free trade agreement. He added: Changing the prime minister changes everything. We can get a better deal. Mr Gove confirmed that he would be prepared to delay Brexit beyond the October  deadline for days or weeksa deal was within reach. Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt claimed the German Chancellor told him Brussels would look at any solutions the UK puts forward to solve the Northern Irish border issue. Asked on Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge On Sunday whether he was confident of renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement, he said: If youaposre asking me as someone who has done deals all their le aposis there a deal here apos, yes, there is. Finding that deal is going to mean approaching the EU with the right kind of person. If we go in with an ultra hardline approach, we will get an ultra hardline response. Mr Javid said offering to pay for changes at the border would secure co-operation from Dublin and Brussels. You donapost need a magic solution for this, the solution exists. Weaposve done the homework on this, the Home Secretary, who has ministerial responsibility for the UKaposs borders, told Sky News. Mr Johnson said he would scrap the backstop - something the EU has so far refused to do - and would settle the Irish border issue only when Brussels is ready to agree to a future relationship. The £ billion settlement would only be paid when there is greater clarity about the way forward, he told the Sunday Times. I always thought it was extraordinary that we should agree to write the entire cheque before having a final deal, he said. In getting a good deal, money is a great solvent and a great lubricant.   In his first major interview of the campaign, the bookmakersapos favourite said only he could defeat the twin threat posed by the leaders of the Brexit Party and Labour - comparing them to the sea monsters from Greek mythology which troubled Odysseus.I truly believe only I can steer the country between the Scylla and Charybdis of Corbyn and Farage and on to calmer water. This can only be achieved by delivering Brexit as promised on October  and delivering a One Nation Tory agenda. Rory Stewart said Mr Johnsonaposs comments on the money and the Irish border were undignied and irresponsible. The former foreign secretary has picked up support from James Cleverly, who pulled out of the leadership race and from prominent Brexiteer Steve Baker who had been considering his own run for the post. He also picked up endorsements from Cabinet ministers James Brokenshire, Chris Grayling and Alun Cairns, and former international development secretary Priti Patel. Mr Javid received a boost with an endorsement from Ruth Davidson, the popular leader of the Scottish Conservatives.

Yet it’s stomach-churning to discover that so many law-breaking Tory law- makers smoked dope and snfed illegal white powder and then piously declared war on less lucky folk doing the same. Police stopping and searching Tory candidates for PM would arrest a rich haul of self-righteous frauds.    Every single one of them at the  election stood on a manesto vowing tougher sentences, including curfews, on drug offenders while boasting about naval vessels to fight the “vile trade” their cash financed.

The low wages, insecure work, lost manufacturing jobs and public services squeezed by pitiless Tory austerity. The hardworking, proud grafters driven to despair by Tory Universal Credit cuts so cruel that their families are forced to rely on foodbank charity to eat.    You would have to be out of your mind on drugs to believe it is legitimate to subcontract who will be Prime Minister to a cartel of reactionaries behaving asthis was the contest for the new chair of a conservative golf club. Tory rivals stabbing each other in the back as they hallucinate over Brexit unicorns and peddle the usual imaginary tax-cut fixes is a failed politics. Under the influence of mind-bending substances or not, these Conservatives kning their way to No are ideologically incapable of delivering social justice. Whether it’s the stain of nearly five million Britons struggling below the breadline, the grabbing of TV licences from lauded D-Day veterans or the Herculean task of piloting Britain’s future as a European power, the Tories are off their heads. Illegal drugs aren’t the primary or even in my top  reasons why this unruly mob are incapable of dealing with the nation’s problems any more than past behaviour rendered David Cameron and George Osborne unsuitable for high office.

Mariyka’s amazing story did not feature in the recent TV hype over the Soviet atomic power station, but she is said to be a symbol of Chernobyl renaissance following the disastrous explosion. She hit the headlines  years ago when she became the first and only baby to be born and brought up living close to blitzed reactor number four. But she has not been seen in the media for years.  Now a -year- old student at a leading higher education institution in Ukraine’s capital Kiev, she was tracked down by the Sunday Express and said: “I am doing well, I am working. “I’m providing for myself. This is it.” When she was born in , the Ukrainian authorities sought to hide the “embarrassment” of her arrival to a family of Chernobyl workers living illegally in the -mile exclusion zone.    Her parents refused to leave the zone because the authorities offered them no alternative housing. But they were harassed and accused of “murdering” their daughter. She swam in a river where fish - which her father Mikhail caught to feed the family - sent Geiger counters bleeping wildly, says the newspaper. She drank milk from a cow fed on Chernobyl pastures irradiated by the nuclear explosion.  Her mother Lydia Sovenko was forced to deny rumours over her daughter’s health. If people think she is a mutant, or has two heads, they are quite wrong,” she said in one interview. She is a lovely child who is absolutely healthy as far as we can see.” Today Mariyka does not wish to highlight her past as she funds her studies working at a fashionable bar. She really doesnapost care about being unique through being born in Chernobyl, said a friend.  In fact, knowing that she is the only child who was born here after the explosion, and who grew up in Chernobyl, is rather painful for her. “She sees it as a stigma. Her health and success - confirmed by her mother and friends - comes as the nature of Chernobyl is fighting back against the appalling nuclear decimation it suffered  years ago. Wildle is teeming in the area with elk, deer, wild boar and wolves thriving as well as rare wild birds and flowers, some of them from the Red Book. As her mother, now , has said: People here believe that Mariyka is a symbol of Chernobylaposs renaissance, a sign from God which they interpret as a blessing to live here, and that le is coming back to this blighted place.” "},{"url":null,"title":"builders leave mans home a","story":"NewsBuilders leave mans home a wreck with gaping holes after ripping ceiling offHomeowner Dominic Gauden spent money from his mothers will on the restoration of his home in Moseley, BirminghamShareCommentsByMike LockleyKaisha Langton:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsDominic with the mess he says has been left by builders \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA historic home has been left in a state of utter carnage by aposcowboyapos builders despite the homeowner spending nearly £,. Dominic Gauden spent every last penny that he was left in his motheraposs will on the restoration of his Victorian house in Moseley, Birmingham.  Now, he cannot even afford the new headstone planned for her grave, Birmingham Live reports. Shockingly, Dominic said that he only wanted a leak fixed, but that the men he employed took the roof off of his -year-old home instead. He added that scaffolding had been erected around the property and had remained in situ for three-and-a-half years - despite the work taking less than a month to complete.    He paid £, on the renovation but claims he has been left with a gaping hole where the back bay window once was, no garage doors, interior walls stripped of plaster and flooding so severe the fire brigade had to be called. The flood is the result of failing to install guttering according to Dominic. He says that this caused a ceiling to collapse and debris to damage a piano and valuable rugs, as well as plaster to fall from the walls. The condition of his home has left its mark on Dominic, who has been signed off work with depression for  months.    Dominic added that he is broke, surrounded by rubble and disarray and tortured by the idea that his mother, acclaimed animal artist Wendy Gauden, who died five years ago at the age of , would be let down. He claims that his judgement was clouded by grief over his motheraposs death and the depression medication when he decided to broker the deal for the work with a pub acquaintance. He is unsure of the real identity of the master builder who executed the work and was not given a business card or address.  Dominic even gave cash in hand payments without asking for receipts. The railway museum volunteer said: “I have spent all that my mum left me in her will. “All the money my mum saved up and it’s just gone. I’m in a daze. “I feel ashamed and embarrassed about the whole thing. I blame myself for being talked into it. “Mum would be turning in her grave. She would never have allowed this to happen – she was assertive and strong-minded. I feel I have let her down. “There are no light thoughts, only dark ones. I’ve tried to block it out with anti-depressants. Iaposm gutted.” Dominic belatedly contacted West Midlands Police and Action Fraud, a public body set up to probe allegations of malpractice, but the -year-old admits he should have put his foot down much, much sooner.    When it came to the workers, Dominic was remarkably compliant. “They got me to go to the pub all the time, he said. “Really awful pubs in places you’d never see me drinking in. “Once they said they’d got tickets to an ’s weekend in Butlins. I really didn’t want to go, but I did. It was like a horror story – they spent all the time in the bookies. “I trusted him. He was quite reserved. He went in the attic, looked up and said he could see light. The roof was off in a week.” During those few weeks the cowboy builders were at his home, a number of problems were detected and the work undertaken grew and grew, costing Dominic more and more.    He was told that the property needed underpinning, something which has since been disputed by the council - but work building a large trench began. The garage doors were removed and gaping holes in the property where the doors once sat remain. The worst of it all for Dominic was when the water-logging ceiling fell on his prize piano in .

The staff member noted his BMW registration plate which was traced to his home address, where he was arrested less than three hours after the offence. He denied the offence during police interviews and refused to answer any questions, but later admitted to the act at Birmingham Crown Court. Waltho has been jailed for  months for indecent exposure.  West Midlands Police Detective Sergeant Mark Hickman from the Child Abuse Investigation Team, said: The young victim was clearly distraught at what happened: she ran to her mum and eventually managed to explain what had happened. Thanks to the alert staff member, and prompt investigation by local officers, Waltho was arrested a short time later the same day. I’d also like to salute the girl’s bravery in disclosing the offence and providing a video interview. Waltho has a history of similar offences and can expect to spend much of his time locked away from society unless he accepts support to address his behaviour and offending.

The former actress, writer, humanitarian - and by her own admission pretty good cook - is, what many believe, redefining what it means to be a royal. Before she was thrust into the spotlight as -year-old Harryaposs future we, she had already forged her own identity as one of the stars of the TV series, Suits. The -year-old regularly documented her le with her now-defunct blog, The Tig, as well as her Instagram account where she shared snaps of her travels and gave fans a glimpse inside her impeccably designed home.    The former orcee, who welcomed her first baby with Harry on May , doesnapost have an aristocracy-laden family tree either. She enjoyed a fairly typical upbringing having been born and raised in Los Angeles by a free-spirited yoga-loving clinical therapist for a mum - who nicknamed her aposFlowerapos - and hardworking television lighting director for a father. Here are some of the ways the Duchess of Sussex has redefined what it means to be a royal and put her own stamp on Royal Family protocol - from her clothing to behaviour.  Upbringing Meghan was born Rachel Meghan Markle on August  in  at Canoga Park in Los Angeles, Calornia in the US. Her mother, Doria Ragland, and father, Thomas Markle, met in the late s on the set of a soap opera where Thomas was a lighting director and Doria was a temp. I like to think he was drawn to her sweet eyes and her Afro, plus their shared love of antiques, Meghan previously said. Whatever it was, they married and had me. They moved into a house in The Valley in LA, to a neighbourhood that was leafy and affordable.    Meghan admitted that as a Calornia girl she lived by the ethos that most things can be cured with either yoga, the beach, or a few avocados. As a youngster, the importance of goodwill and appreciation were also instilled in her. Dad Thomas, now , grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania where Christmas stockings were stuffed with oranges, and dinners consisted of tins of Spam and potatoes. And as Meghan grew up, he taught her the importance of kindness and they would buy turkeys for homeless shelters at Thanksgiving. They would deliver meals to patients in hospice care, donate spare change to those asking for it, as well as offering a simple hug, smile or pat on the back to those who needed it.  And when Thomas won ,on the lottery in , Thomas used part of it to pay for Meghanaposs private school fees so she would have the best education. Her upbringing was in stark contrast to that of other members of the Royal Family, including Princess Diana who was born into one of the UKaposs many noble families - the Spencers. A number of iniduals across multiple generations have gone on to become knights, dukes, earls and barons. Dianaaposs father John Spencer was known as Viscount Althorp until he was honoured with the title th Earl Spencer following the death of his father in . He was also a member of the House of Lords. Dianaaposs mother Frances Shand Kydd was the daughter of Maurice Roche, th Baron Fermoy and a close friend of King George VI. Kate Middleton was also born into a wealthy family with ties to the British aristocracy. Sheaposs a orcee Meghan was previously married to Hollywood producer Trevor Engelson. The pair tied the knot in  in Jamaica but split two years later, citing irreconcilable dferences. Royal correspondent Ashley Pierson said in an interview: They were together for seven years, married for two. The problem with the marriage was the distance.    As soon as they married she got the gig on Suits and she was in Toronto and he was in LA. The relationship just didn’t last. The last orcee to marry into royalty was Wallis Simpson, the twice-married American actress who stole King Edwardaposs heart and prompted him to abdicate so he could be with her. There was also controversy in the Royal Family when Princess Margaret, the Queen’s sister, wanted to marry orced Peter Townsend. She later decided not to pursue the relationship. Public displays of affection with Harry Meghan and husband Harry are frequently photographed showing their affection for each other while out and about during public engagements. The pair are not shy about kissing, holding hands, touching each otheraposs knees or putting an arm around the other - just like a normal loved-up couple. Whereas Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince William are more reserved and are rarely seen wrapping their arms around each other.  They refrain from touching and while there is no official rule restricting PDA, royal etiquette expert Myka Meier believes this is because theyaposre working as representatives of the British monarchy. Myka told People: Technically, the couple are working representatives of the British Monarchy. The couple are likely to show very little PDA,any, to remain professional during their designated roles abroad. However Harry and Meghan canapost seem to keep their hands off each other. Meanwhile, embracing royals is usually off-limits for both security reasons and out of respect for their positions, but kind Meghan has been spotted dishing out hugs to fans. Clothing When Meghan and Harry stepped out for the official photocall after announcing their engagement, the Duchess chose an elegant white belted wrap coat and bottle-green dress. But she bared her legs and decided to go sans-tights, something which is said to be a big no-no. Members of Britainaposs most famous family are expected to wear nude stockings with skirts and dresses, according to royal expert Victoria Arbiter.    You never see a royal without their nude stockings. Meghan, from what I can see from the engagement photographs, it doesnapost look like she was wearing tights or stockings, Arbiter told INSIDER. I would say thataposs really the only hard, steadfast rule in terms of what the Queen requires. Meghan later posed in a gorgeous black Ralph  Russo gown, reported to cost £,, which featured sheer fabric - something the Queen is also claimed not to approve of as it is considered a bit risque. The Duchess also has a very modern dress sense and opts for dark nail polish, despite the Queen rumoured to prefer royals to sport nude shades on their nails. Her heritage Meghan is a proud biracial woman and has always embraced her roots, despite being queried over aposwhat she isapos. She was born to an African-American mum and Caucasian dad. She previously said: Being ‘ethnically ambiguous’, as I was pegged in the [acting] industry, meant I could audition for virtually any role. Morphing from Latina when I was dressed in red, to African American when in mustard yellow my closet filled with fashionable frocks to make me look as racially ied as an Eighties Benetton poster.  Sadly, it didn’t matter: I wasn’t black enough for the black roles and I wasn’t white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn’t book a job. She added: While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identication, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I’m from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman. Meghan and Harryaposs son Archie, seventh in line to the throne, is the first biracial half-American and half-British member of the Royal Family. He is the third biracial member of the Royal Family. His heritage has been described as monumental” by Tessy Ojo, chief executive of the Diana Award, the charity established in honor of Princess Diana. She told PEOPLE magazine: “Like Harry and Meghan’s wedding, it changes the landscape in terms of bringing visibility around race and inclusion. Opinionated Meghan has made no secret of the fact she is a feminist and is not afraid to speak her mind. She was  when she was so outraged by a sexist TV advert she was moved to write letters to movers and shakers to make a change. It marked the beginning of her campaigning. She previously revealed: “I was in my classroom at Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse and a commercial came on for a popular dish washing liquid. The tagline of the campaign said, ‘Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans’. The boys in my classroom yelled out, ‘Yeah, that’s where women belong. In the kitchen’.  My little freckled face became red with anger. I went home and wrote letters to powerhouse feminist attorney Gloria Allred to a host of a kids’ news programmes to the soup manufacturer and to Hillary Clinton . “With the exception of the soap manufacturer, they all pledged support – and within a few months, the commercial was changed to, ‘People all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans’.” Meghan has also been described as a royal not afraid to embrace full-on feminism. The Duchess has spoken of how itaposs important for men aposto understand they can be feminists as wellapos and be part of the conversation, adding my husband certainly is. She is also a passionate charity campaigner and been a United Nations Women’s Advocate. Sheaposs made numerous trips to poverty-stricken countries to offer her support. Self-made Meghanaposs big break came when she landed the role of Rachel Zane on the popular legal drama, Suits. Before that, Meghan had a stint as a case holder in the game show Deal or No Deal, as well as several small film roles, including in Get Him to the Greek, and Horrible Bosses. She also had guest spots in television shows such as CSI: NY, Without a Trace, and The War at Home. Meghan played a nurse in daytime soap opera, General Hospital too. Walked down the aisle on her own Traditionally, the bride’s father gives his daughter away to her husband-to-be as they walk down the aisle. However, Meghanaposs father Thomas was forced to miss the lavish nuptials at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor Castle as he needed heart surgery. Prince Charles did, however, walk Meghan halfway down the aisle. “The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms. Markle to The Royal Family in this way,” Kensington Palace’s statement read. Didnapost have maid of honour Conventionally brides always have a maid of honour. Kate chose sister Pippa as hers and Princess Eugenie chose her sister Beatrice. However, weeks before Meghan and Harry were due to get married, Kensington Palace announced Meghan would not be having a maid of honour - or any adult bridesmaids. A Palace spokesman said she simply couldnapost decide which of her friends to pick adding: She has a very close knit group of friends and did not want to choose one over the other. Snapped signing autographs Technically, members of the Royal Family are not allowed to sign autographs, with the exception being guestbooks. They have to politely declineasked by fans. The long-standing rule has been in place for all royals because of the risk of the signature being forged.  Meghanaposs father-in-law, Prince Charles, is said to turn down such requests with the response: Sorry, they donapost allow me to do that. But it didnapost stop Meghan kindly giving one -year-old fan her autograph during a trip to Cardf in Wales with Harry in January . However the former actress is no doubt used to the request and probably signed hundreds of autographs in the past.    Christmas with the Queen Meghan became the first royal fiancée to spend the Christmas holidays with the Queen at Sandringham. It is understood Harry asked his grandmother to make an exception for Meghan to attend in , despite her not being an official member of the family. Kate was not invited to spend Christmas at the Queenaposs Sandringham estate in Norfolk, East Anglia, after her engagement to Prince William in November . She instead joined her parents at their home in Berkshire. Closed her own car door On her first solo engagement as the Duchess of Sussex at London’s Royal Academy, Meghan closed her own door after getting out of the car. Few royals have ever done this before. People on social media obsessed with the fact that Meghan did something so aposnormalapos and many praised her for being so down to earth.    One person said: A princess who still takes the time to shut her car door. Well done Meghan! Another commented: First time Iaposve seen an on-duty princess shut her own car door... A third wrote: I had to smile - Meghan is closing the door of that car herself - you know sheaposs still used to doing that... Baby Archie Meghan and Harry were determined to dance to their own tune regarding how they handled the announcements surrounding the birth of their first child. Weeks before her due date, it was announced the pair would not be holding a huge photocall on the steps outside the hospital after the baby had been born. Meghan reportedly believed it was archaic. However, it is something Kate and Prince William had done with all three of their children, and Princess Diana and Prince Charles before them. Harry and Meghan had also previously refused to reveal where the Duchess would give birth, sparking speculation she had opted to have a homebirth. It was later revealed that son Archie was born at The Portland Hospital in London. Instagram In a royal first - Harry and Meghan used their Instagram account to break the news they had welcomed a son. The image featured the white intertwining H and M logo, bearing the words aposItaposs a BOY!apos. While underneath it said: aposTheir ROYAL HIGHNESSES the DUKE and DUCHESS of SUSSEX are OVERJOYED to announce the BIRTH of their CHILDapos. Meghan was very social media savvy before she became engaged to Harry and had to delete her accounts. She is also said to use it to post comments on other accounts, including the Kensington Palace one to wish Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis happy birthday. Not shy about gushing over Harry In October , Meghan gave a tell-all interview with Vanity Fair. She revealed some details of her relationship with her then-boyfriend, Harry. She gushed: Weaposre two people who are really happy and in love. We were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news. She added that le as she knew it didnapost change much by entering into the royal relationship, nor did her personality. According to royal historian Carolyn Harris, itaposs surprising that a potential member of the royal family would speak so honestly of their relationship. Carolyn said: In the past, when royal girlfriends did speak to the press, generally that didnapost bode well for the relationship.

She even attended the Royal wedding with him last year, pitching up arm-in-arm, where she had the honour of being seated on the second row on the brideaposs side - putting her in front of Oprah and even Serena Williams.  Before royal le, Meghan frequently posted photos of hersel enjoying downtime with her close female friends, among which she counts Priyanka Chopra and Jessica Mulroney. But according to the Mail, the extent of how close Meghan and Izzy have become has not emerged - until now. Part of Izzyaposs appeal, it is reported, is that she doesnapost engage with social media and refuses to use her royal connections to her advantage.  A source told the Mail: Izzy is one of Meghan’s dearest and closest friends and she values her friendship so very much. Izzy keeps their relationship really quiet and very much under the radar. The time they spend together is private. She helped Meghan adjust to le in London when she moved here from Canada.Meghan relied on her a lot. They are just like any two young female friends. They totally support one another and enjoy lots of social activities together.  In , Izzy moved into the role of head of communications at Burberry, moving last year to David Beckhamaposs company, DB Ventures, where a key part of her role is helping him launch a football team in Miami. Despite her connections, Izzy is said to be determined to not be dragged down in the sort of cashing-in controversies which other people in Meghanaposs le have found themselves in.

Jodie Gaskellaposs first pregnancy experience involved a ruptured membrane which put her at risk of miscarriage, an induced labour, a large hemorrhage during labour and then a post-delivery infection that forced her into isolation. The mum, from Rainhill in Merseyside, said that in the days and weeks after the birth of her daughter, she became so traumatised that she was plunged into post-natal depression and diagnosed with PTSD related to the delivery, the Liverpool Echo reported. Only three years after this traumatic experience, Jodie lost an unborn baby boy. The miscarriage once again pushed the mother-of-one into depression.     Her daughter Sophia was born in  and in the days and weeks following her birth Jodie became so traumatised by the experience she was plunged into post-natal depression and diagnosed with post traumatic stress related to the delivery. She said: There was a fear I would lose the baby, they had to ensure the fluid around Sophia, basically that I wasnapost losing fluid. Luckily, unusually, what I ruptured healed itself and they got me to a safe period in my pregnancy where I was induced four weeks early. I didnapost take well to the gel when induced and my contractions came on straight away. Her heartbeat was dangerously high and I was rushed to delivery and given injections to stop my contractions. When she arrived she was taken straight to special care for heartbeat problems and issues with nerves in her arm. She was really jaundiced.  I only got to hold her for a little while. Following the hemorrhage I suffered an infection and was placed in isolation. For two days I couldnapost see anyone.    After daughter Sophia was born, Jodie was put under more strain when husband James was sent back on active duty with the Royal Navy. She continued: With depression you have guilt and shame and itaposs dficult to express those emotions, you feel like you need to suppress it and the more your mental health deteriorates you canapost get past it. Thataposs the position I was in when I was finally able to speak to my husband. He was working away at the time, I said aposI canapost do this anymoreapos. Jodie managed to get her mental health back on track with counselling, meditation and reigniting her old passion of netball. She joined the Phoenix Netball team and credits them with helping her regain her confidence and learn to cope with the depression she felt. She said: In  I had a late miscarriage,  I lost the baby at  weeks. It was a dferent feeling, a feeling of grief and aposwhy me, why again apos Itaposs a new experience itaposs dficult to explain unless youaposve been through it, we are grieving, itaposs dficult to express the grief, itaposs not a baby you hold in your arms but itaposs still a baby to you. It happens that often but people deals with it in dferent ways. I had to give birth to the baby and had a funeral it was really traumatic. I quickly started suffering from depression and anxiety. I think when it happened to me the only way to deal with it was to express all the feelings I wanted to . I knew with experience after SophiaI didnapost talk about it and express feelings it can do more harm than good in the long run. But talking about it can help. Jodie is now encouraging other people experiencing mental health problems to explore recovery options they hadnapost even considered, such as reigniting to old passions and activities they once loved.

But how about the one in our skies  Airline passengers ­generated over . million tons – an average of .kg per passenger – of cabin waste in , a figure set to double within  yearsno action is taken. Toilet waste is included in that statistic. But so are ­miniature wine bottles, half-eaten lunch trays, unused toothbrushes, plastic cups, water bottles, wrapping and other hallmarks of air travel. Most of this is unrecyclable and destined for landfill or incineration.  The aviation industry has taken flak for its growing greenhouse gas emissions as passenger numbers rise. But its massive waste footprint could be reduced by introducing some simple changes. America’s United Airlines has switched to compostable paper cups and now donates unused amenity kits to homeless and women’s shelters. Virgin, meanwhile, has set up a system for recycling all parts of headsets, including ear sponges, which are used as flooring for equestrian centres. Despite actions like these, mountains of airline waste continue to grow. While we are getting the hang of taking our water bottles for refills while on the go from coffee shops and at work, our airports have a long way to go. For more than a decade, passengers have been unable to take in excess of ml of liquid past airport security.But the Civil Aviation Authority says passengers trying to cut down on their plastic footprint – and avoid costs of up to £ a bottle – can bring empties to be filled airside. But I’ve found two-thirds of UK airports do not provide any drinking fountains in departure lounges. While many of the bigger airports, including Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester and Stansted do, Glasgow Prestwick, ­Cornwall Newquay, Norwich, Leeds ­Bradford, Bournemouth, London City, Durham Tees Valley, Doncaster Sheffield, Belfast International, Newcastle, London Southend and City of Derry don’t. Heathrow came top with  water fountains spread across four terminals easily found with an online map. Approximately  billion plastic bottles are used each year in the UK. Only . billion are recycled.Simply adding more water fountains in airports and other public areas is one way to stop this.

Itaposs true, we are together, Emanuel said at a party last week, according to the Daily Mail. Itaposs not a case of going gay as such but now that I am with David, he helps me with business things and we are a couple. Welsh fashion designer David was previously married to Elizabeth Emanuel, , with whom he jointly created Dianaaposs ivory silk taffeta and antique lace gown for her wedding to Prince Charles in .    The dress, which made them household names, also featured , pearls and sequins, and had a ft train. The pair have two children together -  Oliver, , and Eloise,  - and separated in  before orcing. David, who came runner-up to Westleaposs Kian Egan on Iaposm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in , said he aposdidnapost knowaposElizabeth knew of his new romance. And I donapost care, he added. He currently presents TLCaposs Say Yes to the Dress.  David, who previously beat prostate cancer, has also dressed some of the world’s most famous women including Dame Shirley Bassey, Joan Collins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Madonna and Elizabeth Taylor. Yet surprisingly fashion was not the only love of this working-class Welsh boy who grew up with nine brothers and one sister. He sang with the Glamorgan Youth Choir at eisteddfods and also proved to be a gted pianist and violinist. He previously said that it was only fate that chose fashion as his future. “There were two things I cared about at school – music and art. I applied to both music school and art college and the envelope for art college came through first,” he told thein November .  It was at the Harrow School of Art where he met Elizabeth Weiner, the American designer who became his we in  and with whom he went on to study at the Royal College of Art – the only husband and we team ever to be accepted. It was soon after college that Lady Diana Spencer, as she then was, commissioned the relatively unknown Emanuel team to make That Dress. “Elizabeth’s father, supermarket tycoon Buddy Weiner, had faith in his daughter and so while other art graduates struggled she and her husband were given a Mayfair salon,” author Compton Miller, who wrote Who’s Really Who, previously said. “Bianca Jagger became their first celebrity client and some would say success came too quickly for this twinkly little couple who always insisted that they would have become famous even without Diana.”  There was no chance to test the truth of this because after the royal wedding David’s career soared. He and Elizabeth became household names and were accorded the privilege of having their portrait hung in the National Portrait Gallery. However the pressures of working together around the clock in such a creative and competitive industry overwhelmed them. They separated in  despite attempting to remain together for the sake of their children.

Capturing a a mum moments after giving birth, by herself in bed, Alex adds an explanation: I saw you, mama. I saw the pain in your eyes and in your face and in your body.  Because this is now a new season called postpartum. We tend to forget our mamas when babies are around. We ask how baby is, what does baby need, can we hold the baby, can we buy this for the baby but ... what about mama  Postpartum care for a mum is of paramount importance to both her and baby, and extends for weeks after giving birth. But it shouldnapost just just encompass the medical or physiological side of things.    As Alex points out, what also helps are: Meals dropped off, someone to watch baby so they can shower, solid child care for her other children, house cleaners to stop by and help out. Heating pads and coffee and comfy PJs. Maybe fast food. Or a friend to fold laundry. Maybe a new movie to watch or your Netflix login. Thereaposs few things as miraculous as new le, but itaposs important to take care of people behind that bundle of joy.

A clinic in Novosibirsk fitted the new bionic paws using sophisticated computer tomography and D modelling.    Vet Sergey Gorshkov boasted: “He is definitely the first cat in the world who experienced such surgeries. “The limbs have fully connected with the skin and bone. “The part of the limb that goes inside the body is spongy, the bone tissue grows inside it. He added: “We achieved a good result.  Ryzhik - meaning redhead or ginger in Russian - is not trying to remove the limbs, indicating he is content with his new mobility. Gorshkov’s clinic is pioneering new methods of helping animals in distress, including the patenting of a technique for attaching articial limbs to birds.

Murtaja Quereiris was arrested three years later over his part in a bicycle protest during the aposs Arab Spring uprisings. Now , he is facing execution and is believed to be the youngest known political prisoner in the Gulf kingdom, reports CNN . As a boy he was reportedly filmed taking part in the bike protest in the kingdomaposs Eastern Province. He was captured grinning, wearing jeans and flip-flops and smiling at the camera, before shouting through a megaphone: The people demand human rights! He was also featured in clips with his father, said to be named Abdullah, with neither of the pair wearing masks or face-scarves unlike many other activists in the footage captured years ago.    Three years after the protest he was detained at the border as he tried to travel with his family to Bahrain. He has reportedly been held in pre-trial detention ever since. Now  , a charge sheet recommending the death penalty for the teen cites charges including allegations of violence committed during protests – including helping to construct Molotov cocktails — shooting at security forces and marching at his brother’s funeral in . His brother died taking part in the protests when Murtaja was , and CNN says footage shows anti-government slogans being chanted by mourners during the procession.    The charge sheet also reportedly lists the death penalty, which can include crucixion or dismemberment after execution, in the strictest possible punishment available to Saudi Arabia under its authoritiesapos strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law. The prosecution has accused the teen of the sowing of sedition over his alleged activities as a boy during the Arab Spring, which will reportedly see him tried in a terror court. He denies all the charges, and said confessions were obtained under duress. The kingdom, which is criticised by human rights watchdogs as carrying out among the highest rates of executions in the world, announced the execution of  men in April.This year already executed three prisoners over crimes allegedly committed before they turned . Human rights groups claimed the men were mostly from Saudia Arabiaaposs Shia minority.    The age at which children can be prosecuted in the kingdom is unclear, but Human Rights Watch says it is believed to have been raised to  for boys, but remains boundless for girls. Its guidance states: Children under age  may also be subject to arrest and prosecution because new standards announced in  raising the age of criminal responsibility from seven to  for boys do not appear to be well publicised or enforced. Regulations governing girls in conflict with the law do not set any minimum age of criminal responsibility.    It says Saudi religious enforcers routinely stop children in the street and detain them for offences as vague as swapping phone numbers with a member of the opposite sex, or,girls are found alone with a male who is not a family member. While Saudi Arabia did not comment on the latest reports, the United Nations Working Group for Arbitrary Detentionhad in  highlighted the case of an unnamed jailed Saudi minor matching Murtajaaposs case, according to CNN. The UN working group described the demonstrations as likely to have been peaceful demonstrations calling for justice for protesters who had been killed.    The group, which did not comment on the latest revelations, had in  described the unnamed minoraposs confessions as extracted and arrest arbitrary, with the detention violating international norms. The death penalty is only able to be enforced in the kingdom by order of King Salman or a representative. His powerful son, the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been touted as heralding more progressive social reforms in the kingdom. But he has nonetheless been involved in the detention of influential Saudis including activists and womenaposs rights defenders.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

All it took was a request and the work was done in time for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day on June .Geordie Rhodick, chairman, LAFDSirFor the past two years, since he was elected to Argyll and Bute Council by the skin of his teeth, Councillor Alastair Redman has bombarded local newspapers with a constant stream of drivel attacking the Scottish Government.In his latest diatribe, he alleges that #the SNP has completely misjudged the mood of voters up and down the country#.I know it will be extremely painful for him, buthe can bring himself to review last week’s European Election results in Scotland, he’ll see the complete fallacy of this statement, andhe wants to look even closer to home, he’ll see that the SNP polled , votes in Argyll and Bute – , votes ahead of the Tories who came a distant fourth.Hardly a sign of his mythical assertion that Ruth Davidson is poised to be the next First Minister of Scotland.Robert Macintyre, Serpentine Road, RothesayDear PaulI write on behalf of constituents in Tarbert regarding the application for the Inveraray to Crossaig kV overhead line, which is with the [Scottish Government] Energy Consents Unit.A very large number of constituents have contacted me regarding this matter and almost  have signed a petition.They believe the proposal will have a major deleterious effect on the village and will be a huge and ugly blot on the landscape which, given the very attractive and scenic nature of the area, will be a big disincentive to tourism and will spoil the enjoyment of the area for residents as well.I have met with SSE to discuss this issue and have made it clear to them that the community wishes the company to come forward with alternative proposals, which must include undergrounding the cableno route can be found which does not spoil the visual amenity of the village.I know that the new line is needed for entirely understandable and positive reasons, and I have had only a few complaints from other parts of the area which will be affected.The opposition in Tarbert is virtually unanimous and there is also concern being expressed from those who know and value the area but do not live there.I hope that any consideration of consent will ensure that this issue is dealt with in accordance with the views of local people and I would be grateful to hear from you what the timescale is for that decision .Michael RussellSir,Newly-elected UK MEPs will take their seats in the European Parliament in July and it is crucial they recognise their signicant role in shaping the policies that impact on farming businesses. This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have. We are also inviting them to meet with us in person in Brussels and with our permanent staff in our Brussels office, the British Agriculture Bureau.Andrew McCornickMinette BattersJohn Daviesand Ivor Ferguson "},{"url":null,"title":"show us your mojo","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDon#t miss out on your chance to play on MOJO#s unique live stage on October  in Ardfern.Bands have only three weeks left to enter their demo on to MOJO organisers, so don#t delay to be part of this exclusive night of original live music.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle.

Loch Fyne likes to mix it up a bit so the fleets ventured out into more sedate conditions than those forecast. But as the weather built, race officers shortened the traditional round Inchmarnock passage race.Sunday prizes featured an additional prize for the best performer in each fleet. Glenn Porter started proceedings with a special award for #assisting mark layers# to the competitor who got tangled up in one of the race marks. In IRC Class  it was El Gran Senor and Forty Licks shining through. The Makars Mash RC class saw Hijacker leading the prize haul. In IRC Class it was Mata taking the #extra# prize.

Finally, the CYCA restricted sail fleet saw Celtic Spirit take first place.The  event saw the marquee remain open for the Sunday evening as part of additional shoreside activities supported by Event Scotland.An earlier start on Monday was greeted with sunshine and no wind. This time the challenge was just too much for race officers who had to abandon racing for the day.

Eventually they evolved into the largest creatures ever known # the titanosaurs, including the aptly named Dreadnoughtus #  metres long and weighing more than ,kg –  times heavier than an African elephant.Like most youngsters, dinosaurs fascinated me in primary school, but I never thought to ask how they sustained their enormous bulk. As Brusatte describes in his brilliant book*, the answer is their unique body plan.Adult titanosaurs needed to eat around kg of foliage daily, a feat accomplished by the addition, and enlarging, of vertebrae to extend their distinctive necks. So, by just standing still and swinging their heads, they could consume all plants within a -metre-diameter circle, while expending very little energy.But how did they manage to move around when just lting their heads and feet appears to defy gravity  Everything is explained by adaptations to their respiratory system, which combined an energy-generating machine and an air-con system, which also helped movement.Titanosaur lungs were connected to numerous air sacs that filled body cavities, even burrowing extensively into bones. Air sacs stored oxygen-rich air that passed through the lungs in one direction only, allowing for super-efficient oxygen extraction. What’s more, the air sacs# huge surface area dissipated heat, so averting heat stress. And finally, by creating a honey-comb effect in bones, air sacs lightened without weakening the skeleton, thereby allowing animals to move around with ease.If only we could have met these giants. But at least theirclose relatives are around today. Birds are dinosaurs. And with the same efficient respiration and light-weight bones they can fly far and high, even over Mount Everest.*Steve Brusatte, Author of The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-herald-launches-free-online-access-to-students","story":"Accessto fact-based truth in society is a more pressing need than ever, Scotlandrsquos Minister for Public Finance and Digital Economy has insisted.Kate Forbes MSPsaid that at a time when debate within society is becoming increasingly polarised, the ability to read reliable information would be vital.Her comments came as The Herald launched a new initiative to provide free access to heraldscotland across all colleges and universities in Scotland.It means any student or staff member who logs on to heraldscotland while connected to their campus wi can read its content free of charge.ldquoAccess to information, knowledge, fact and truth is more pressing than ever before, she said, ldquoand with The Heraldrsquos initiative they can provide that access to students and employees, which will hopefully set good habits for years to come.\"She added: ldquoThe Herald understands that easy access is critical.The new open access project issponsored by CGI, a technology consultancy group, and made possible by IT company JISC, who provide digital solutions for the UK education and research sector.The Herald has a long and strong relationship with Scotlandrsquos leading educational establishments.

\"Currently, UNESCO estimates that one in ten African adolescent girls do not attend school while they have their period and that their full engagement in school activities is negatively

By this time all ranks of the Battalion had been briefed on maps with bogus name and map references - but everyone was fully in the lsquopicturersquo as to the plan for the invasion of the continent . The time in A was spent testing weapons and lsquoteeingrsquo up all the last details for the lsquobig dayrsquo.In the early morning of June , the Battalion embussed in TCVs and moved to the final Assembly area at Victoria Barracks, Plymouth. At am we were informed that owing to bad weather the operation had been postponed  hours.On June  we again moved to Victoria Barracks and at  hours started embarking on LSIs , although there was a fairly heavy sea running. The Battalion was on board by .. We sat at anchor until . when we set sail for the big adventure for which most of us had been waiting four years. It was an amazing sight, all around as far as the eye could see, there were ships of all shapes and sizes bobbing up and down on the water with their ensigns flying bravely in the summer breeze. As we passed the flag ship, with our Divisional Commander, Major-General Rennie and Admiral Vian on board, all ranks turned out on deck and saluted while the pipers played our Regimental march ldquoBlue Bonnets orsquoer the Border.The sea journey was one of the worst we had experienced, there was a heavy swell running and most of the Battalion felt very ill. After midnight maps were issued and from these, we saw we were scheduled to lsquotouch downrsquo at Lion-Sur-Mer about three miles west of Ouistreham.About . on June  we could see faintly the coast of Normandy on the horizon, all around us were battleships, cruisers and destroyers firing at the enemy, while overhead there was a continual stream of bombers and fighters. As we drew nearer the shore, we could see LCAs, DUKWs, etc ferrying stores from larger ships to shore.At . we were ordered to lsquostand byrsquo to disembark. Each man carried his normal equipment and personal weapon plus to extra bandoliers of ammunition, two -hour ration packs and an airborne bicycle. We had expected a wet landing but when we touched down, dead on time at ., we stepped off the LCI on to the shore. The Navy had certainly put up a terric show and now it was up to us.It took only a few minutes for the Battalion to disembark and then we moved off to our Assembly area north of Hermanville-Sur-Mer , this move was carried out without incident except for a few heavy shells from the coastal guns at Le Havre.At . the Battalion were ordered to move to St Aubin drsquoArquenay and ordered to lsquodig inrsquo. At . we witnessed what must be one of the most spectacular sights of the war - the landing of the Reserve Brigade of the th Airborne Division. It was certainly heartening for us, as up to then we had the feeling that we were all alone on the continent. Several prisoners were brought in during the night.Early on June  we prepared to attack the village of Gazelle. We moved on bicycles through Periers-Sur-le-Dan preparatory to the attack. At midday patrols reported Gazelle clear of the enemy and led by lsquoCrsquo Companythe Battalion moved through Gazelle to the woods north of Le Mesnil.We stayed until the morning of the th when we were relieved by the S Lancs while the Royal Ulster Rlesattacked Cambes Wood. At . the Battalion was ordered to pass through the RUR who had reached their objectives but were pinned down by heavy machine Gun, and Mortar Fire. The Battalion attacked after passing through the RUR and were met by machine gun fire and heavy mortar fire, but all Coys successfully reached their objectives. The Battalion suffered several casualties mainly from mortar fire.From June  to  the Battalion remained in Cambes Wood, where we were continually shelled and mortared and suffered fairly heavy casualties.Enemy mortar and artillery was very active ndash Battalion HQ receiving most attention. lsquoArsquo Coy HQ unfortunately came in for a very heavy lsquostonkrsquo and lost five killed and seven wounded.

A large formation of Allied bombers raided Caen in the early evening.On July  the Battalion again moved forward, this time to the area of Lebissey. There was some enemy mortar and artillery fire, but few casualties were suffered.On July  in conjunction with the RUR and Canadians, the Battalion attacked Caen. The Battalion was ordered to attack from the West with the RUR on our right. The Battalion moved to the Forming Up Pointon the outskirts of Caen. We were continually shelled from the Eastern side of the River Orne. It was a very unpleasant approach march to the FUP as the ground was completely open and overlooked from the high ground on the far side of the river. Led by lsquoCrsquo and lsquoDrsquo Coys the Battalion advanced into Caen and proceeded to winkle out the enemy. This proved a very slow job, the town had been heavily bombed and the roads crated or blocked by rubble, giving ideal cover from snipers and Spandau posts.

The civilians gave everyone a terric welcome and produced wine, fruit and bouquets of flowers.On July  the Battalion continued to lsquomop uprsquo the town. There was slight enemy shelling during the day.On the morning of July , the Battalion were relieved by Canadians and moved to a rest area at Plumeto where the time was spent cleaning up, kit inspections and parades.

This was the worst approach march the Battalion had ever experienced. It was a hot summerrsquos day and having to follow the same route as an armoured Div and we were completely overlooked by the enemy.

comfortable.At TweedLoversquos annual event the GO e-bike Family Ride, supported by Frog Bikes, all participants will be provided with a Do The Ride Thing bike bell.This aims to encourage the message of good cycling manners on the path and negate the problem of cyclists approaching other users at speed with no warning.A small gesture which will hopefully have a huge benefit to the users of the multi-use path.Hillside Outside created TweedLove to encourages cycling as a mode of transport, on any sort of bike, and showcases the ease of using the Tweed Valley Railway Path.Harley Lothian, Hillside Outside, said: ldquoIt is well-known that adopting cycling as a mode of transport provides many benefits from improved physical and mental health to positive environmental impacts, and it has recently become much easier with the introduction of electric bikes.ldquoTweeddale benefits from its own GO e-bike hub based in Innerleithen to provide the local community access to electric bikes for personal use.ldquoAnd electric cargo bikes for the business community, making it easier to adopt cycling as a transport method in the Tweed Valley.ldquoDo The Ride Thing will continue to promote these

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area.

It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

brother as part of a Preston Athletic Youth FC group that had travelled to the park in Yorkshire for a weekend football tournament.However, as reported in last weekrsquos Courier, the entire group of  people were asked to leave a day early after several incidents involving adults and young players.Flamingo Land took the decision to evict the group after a couplersquos domestic altercation at the bar resulted in security being called and, in a separate incident, police were called to the park to arrest a young woman on suspicion of assault.Sophiersquos dad Michael Carruthers, a coach for the

morning totally unaware of the events of the previous evening which resulted in the group not allowed to remain at the park, where they were due to stay another night, after their football tournament at nearby sports pitches ended.ldquoIt was all very upsetting, he said.ldquoWe didnrsquot really know what was going on. To kick everyone out after a few incidents seems to me really unfair.ldquoThere were young kids there who were very upset and humiliated.ldquoAs I understand it, the people responsible for what happened had offered to leave so that the rest of us could stay.

My daughter had her walker with her instead of her chair and was already struggling at how far she had had to travel there was no way they could ask her to walk another fair distance to the buses.ldquoIt was after what felt like ages, and I had kicked up a bit of a fuss, they finally let the buses come down to us to collect us.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The school, which is at the heart of more than  new homes at Letham Mains, is being funded entirely through developersrsquo contributions.Morrison Construction, which is also behind the development of the nearby East Lothian Community Hospital, was appointed to build the primary school, which will have  classrooms suitable for pre-school and primary teaching, a dining hall, social space and a two-court PE hall with retractable seating for performance and community use.Now the foundations and concrete base have been completed and the steel frame is being put in place.As part of the projectrsquos

Tranentrsquos eastern edge, despite the land being earmarked solely for economic development.Developers insisted that the only way to bring businesses onto the site was by generating funds from the sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos Planning Committee, and of course in respect of our adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan , which is now the basis of all planning considerations in East Lothian and provides clear guidance on

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-labour-backs-confirmatory-vote-on-any-brexit-deal","story":"Labourrsquos Scottish Executive Committeebacked shting the partyrsquos Brexit policy to one of unequivocal support for a confirmatory vote on the terms of leaving the European Union.Richard Leonard, who announced his backing for a clearer stance on Brexit following ldquoan incredibly bad result in the European election, pledged to ldquowholeheartedly campaign for a Remain victory.Read more:Scottish Labour to decide on support for referendum on Brexit dealFollowing the decision, Mr Leonard said: ldquoI am pleased that Scottish Labourrsquos Executive Committee has endorsed my call for the party to back a confirmatory vote on any Brexit deal, with Remain as an option on the ballot paper.ldquoScottish Labour will wholeheartedly campaign for a Remain victory in such a vote.ldquoOnly Scottish Labour is building a radical  for investment in people and communities, our industries and our public services.I am pleased that @ScottishLabourrsquos Executive Committee has endorsed my call for the party to back a confirmatory vote on any Brexit deal with Remain as an option on the ballot paper.Scottish Labour will wholeheartedly campaign for a Remain victory in such a vote.mdash Richard LeonardJune , A statement from Scottish Labour said that ldquothere have been signicant developments in the Brexit process since their previous position was decided at the partyrsquos conference in Dundee in March, adding: ldquoTheresa Mayrsquos deal is dead.ldquoScottish Labour will therefore campaign for any Brexit deal to be automatically put to the people in a confirmatory vote.Letters: Labour refuses to learn from its past mistakesldquoWe will campaign for that vote to have a clear option to Remain.ldquoScottish Labour will campaign in the confirmatory vote to Remain in the European Union,the statement added.Approximately % of Scottish voters backed remain-supporting parties in the European election, won in Scotland by the SNP, which secured .%.The SEC decision to officially support a referendum on any Brexit deal, and campaign to remain in the EU, was made during a meeting in Glasgow on Saturday in response to the loss of both MEPs in Mayrsquos election, when they slumped to fth place with .% of the vote.On the day after the results were announced, Neil Findlay MSP, an ally of Mr Leonard, announced he was stepping down as Labourrsquos Brexit spokesman due to party infighting.He was followed by justice spokesman Daniel Johnson, who resigned blaming ldquothe current direction and leadership of the party.Read more:Row in Scottish Labour as complaints lodged against senior figuresCommenting on the announcement of support for a confirmatory vote,Ian Murray, the peoplersquos vote-supporting Labour MP for Edinburgh South, said: ldquoThis is a very welcome decision by the SEC.ldquoI applaud Richard Leonard for listening to voters and acting so swtly to change party policy.ldquoThese words must now be turned into action and we must get out there and campaign vocerously for a final say on Brexit and for the UK to remain in the EU."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9963599.jpg?type=article-full","title":"how-we-can-make-tourism-work-in-scotland","story":"Tourism is a success story in Scotland but therersquos a growing mood that visitors cause more trouble than they are worth. As the holiday season begins, Writer at Large Neil Mackay, discovers how we can make tourism work better for all of Scotland.SUCCESS brings its own problems. Just ask Malcolm Roughead, the man who runs VisitScotland. Hersquos sold Scotland to the world and made the country outperform the rest of the UK, year after year, when it comes to attracting visitors from overseas. Apart from London, Edinburgh is the leading UK destination. Scotland regularly appears in lsquoTop Fiversquo lists internationally as a world class holiday spot.Itrsquos little wonder, really. Think of the nationrsquos landscape, history, shopping, sports, food and drink, and culture. Itrsquos a great all-round package for a traveller. Tourism is now the third most important pillar of the Scottish economy after financial services and energy. Therersquos , tourism businesses in the country employing , people, thatrsquos one in  jobs - making the sector worth pound. billion.But back to those problems. When tourism takes off in a country, itrsquos not long until folk living in the hot spots get a little peeved. That problem even has a name lsquoDoxeyrsquos Irritation Indexrsquo - a term academics use to explain the four stages towns and cities go through when tourists start to arrive. First therersquos euphoria - itrsquos great to be noticed after all then comes apathy - tourists get boring then irritation - why is my morning train filled with foreigners and finally, antagonism - I hate tourists.Streets get crowded, roads get jammed, properties get bought over for tourist lets skewing the housing market. Look at whatrsquos happening in Edinburgh and Skye right now - the two parts of the country really feeling the pressure of being beloved by tourists. This summer Skye will be teeming with visitors, roads will all but come to a standstill. Itrsquoll drive locals crazy. In Edinburgh, Airbnb is squeezing locals out of the property market - turning residential homes into tourists lets and jacking house prices and rents. No wonder some call it Unfairbnb. Airbnb has doubled in Edinburgh since , and therersquos now one Airbnb let in the city for every  residents - London has one for every  citizens. Only a few days ago, the head of the Fringe Shona McCarthy, warned of Edinburgh becoming lsquoseriously in danger of being anti-touristrsquo. Edinburgh and Skye may not be Barcelona where graffiti has been sprayed on walls telling tourists to go home, but therersquos a growing animosity to the way the success of being a great travel destination has affected the lives of ordinary people.As the summer holiday season starts to get underway, some of the nationrsquos leading industry experts have spoken of the need to remodel how we lsquodorsquo tourism in Scotland - in order to stop visitors antagonising locals. Tourism needs to be fair and to bring added value to the communities which feel disrupted. It looks like government will have to get involved - in an industry which traditionally has seen the state pretty hands-off. Money needs spent to offset the disruption tourism brings, and thatrsquos going to cause a headache in Holyrood. Therersquos other big ideas out there too when it comes to changing the face of Scottish tourism. lsquoWellnessrsquo - the whole mind, body, spirit trend - is the next big thing, along with lsquoGreen Tourismrsquo. What country is better placed to exploit those trends than Scotland, with towering mountains, beautul lochs and rugged coasts. But will even greater tourism success just bring more headaches as lsquoundiscoveredrsquo parts of the country begin to attract more visitors Here, we look at some of the big ideas being discussed to change the face of Scottish tourism for the better. SHARE THE LOVEThe trick that needs pulled off in Scottish tourism is dispersal. How do you get travellers out of places like Edinburgh, Glasgow, Skye and Inverness and into parts of the nation untouched by tourism  Dr Andrew Martin runs the Scottish Centre for Tourism, operating out of Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen. He wants to see lsquotourism refresh the parts of Scotland other industries cannot reach - like Scotland beyond the Central Belt - which struggle as theyrsquore remote and donrsquot have other big industriesrsquo.Our rural communities often have a depopulation problem, and Martin says growing tourism will create jobs and see people staying rather than leaving. He also thinks the parts of Scotland which are tourist success stories need to lsquotake less people - but get them to spend more hellip bank where we are now and grow the spend per head which will take the pressure off the infrastructure and deliver greater economic benefit per touristrsquo. That means more high quality hotels in our hot spots, not cheap tourist traps.That could start pushing visitors out to other parts of the country where tourists travel less - like Martinrsquos own patch in Aberdeen and the north east. Tourism in Scotland is patchy, he says. KEEP THE LOCALS HAPPYGlenfinnan is currently experiencing the Harry Potter effect. Like many parts of Scotland, film and TV have drawn visitors to the Highland village. Outlander had a similar effect on places like Doune Castle. The Glenfinnan viaduct appears on screen as the Hogwarts Express chugs across it. Crowds are gathering to take pictures and soak up the scenery - but the village has only  residents and a very small carpark. Itrsquos getting a little unmanageable.The Scottish governmentrsquos relatively small Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund handed out poundm in its first round of grants to  projects across the country. Money was set aside for more parking at Glenfinnan. But really, thatrsquos just going to make tourists lives better - rather than the lives of locals. Dr Marjory Brewster, who lecturers in tourism at Queen Margaret University, says: lsquoThe infrastructure fund seems to focus on the tourists and it seems to overlook the communities and the impact that tourism might have on them.rsquoGovernment needs to help local communities lsquobenefit directly from tourismrsquo - one way of doing that, says Brewster, is to help small business set up. If people are making money and getting jobs from tourism, theyrsquore unlikely to see it as disruptive and negative. FLOG THE HIGHLAND GAMESBrewsterrsquos real field of expertise is Scotlandrsquos highland games. In fact, shersquos something of a world authority on this traditional part of our national culture. So, shersquos a little bemused why more isnrsquot made of the -plus highland games across the country when it comes to tourism.Authenticity is the buzz word in business these days - but nowhere is it more important than in tourism. Travellers want to feel asthey have experienced the real Scotland. lsquoHighland games are not promoted for tourists,rsquo Brewster says, lsquobut these are the kind of events that are traditional and have been there for hundreds of years. Itrsquos an honest authentic experience.rsquoAgain, pushing travellers out to rural communities where games go on, would see money cascade further afield and ease pressure on existing hot spots struggling to cope with visitor numbers. AVOID THE FATE OF SKYEAT the moment, Skye is a laboratory for tourism experts studying what happens when an area takes off internationally. Marina Martinolli set up the Skye Project - otherwise known as the Skye Tourism Economic Impact Study - from her base at Glasgow Caledonian University.Idyllic Instagram images going viral online, Outlander - the Skye Boat Song features as the seriesrsquo title music - as well as the opening of the Skye bridge to the mainland, and the removal of tolls, turbocharged tourism on the island. The economy has boomed, but infrastructure is creaking, particularly when it comes to roads and housing.In June , there were  Airbnb rentals on Skye, as of June last year there were . lsquoAirbnb has exploded and itrsquos a huge issue,rsquo she says. Therersquos been estimates that one in eight properties on Skye is an Airbnb.lsquoFor locals who want to buy properties, value has increased and they can no longer afford the same housing they used to,rsquo she says. Housing is also in short supply, and there are fewer properties to rent. Young people are leaving. Seasonal hospitality workers sometimes have to camp. lsquoTherersquos resentment in certain areas,rsquo says Martinolli.lsquoThe practical way to address it is to invest in the island, invest in the infrastructure so it can support the number of visitors coming to the island.rsquo Martinolli says the rural tourism infrastructure fund has projects on Skye for improved visitor parking at the Old Man of Storr and the Fairy Pools. Yet therersquos a homelessness problem on the island. lsquoThere are families waiting to be housed on Skye,rsquo says Martinolli, lsquoand thatrsquos a huge issue. Therersquos a lack of funding.rsquoTherersquos calls for a serious discussion about a tourism tax in the area, charging visitors to Skye, and the reintroduction of a levy on the bridge for non-residents - and that any such money should stay on the island. Current taxes raised on the island go to central government and so arenrsquot directly spent on Skyersquos needs when it comes to tourism.There is so much potential for Skye,rsquo Martinolli says. lsquoThe worry is that it just becomes a tourist attraction and nothing . We donrsquot want to go down that road. There are real people and communities and they have to be supported - they have to get benefits from tourism, not just the negative impact. If investment goes back into the island then itrsquos a win-win for everyone.rsquo At the moment, though, she says, the big winners lsquoare the Airbnbs of this worldrsquo. Success needs to tickle down. MARKETING UNDISCOVERED SCOTLANDlsquoWhy do we continue to market Edinburgh rsquo asks Professor John Lennon, founder of the Moffat Centre for Travel and Tourism at Glasgow Caledonian University. Lennon is seen as Scotlandrsquos number one authority on tourism. He was instrumental in the creation of the North Coast  - known as Scotlandrsquos Route .People will come to Edinburgh no matter what - itrsquos like London, New York or Paris. lsquoWhy donrsquot we move that marketing budget, that development budget, out to other parts of Scotland where tourism could have a real impact,rsquo Lennon says.lsquoWe really need to rebalance the impacts of tourism, and where we get over-demand and all the impact that goes with that, like litter and traffic. Think about what imaginative marketing could do with undiscovered Scotland,rsquo he says.Lennon points to Italian tourism - where visitors can enjoy the hustle and bustle of big cities like Rome, or wile away the days in sleepy villages enjoying local food and wine. Thatrsquos a model Scotland could follow.Lennon does though caution against lsquothe Scottish disease of bashing successrsquo. His North Coast  project - which has dispersed tourists to parts of Scotland rarely visited - has come in for criticism over busier roads. lsquoIrsquom scratching my head and wondering what I was supposed to achieve there by developing a route,rsquo he says. If the roads werenrsquot busier then the project would have been a failure, he says. Other countries, like Ireland he says, would lsquodance a jigrsquo over any tourist success story. WELLNESS TOURISMItrsquos everywhere these days. The lsquowellnessrsquo trend has taken over just about every aspect of le from work to play to food and travel. Dr Marjory Brewster says lsquotherersquos a wealth of opportunityrsquo for Scotland to exploit the new trend. lsquoSensory tourism, being outdoors, feeling the wind, smelling the sea - many of these trendy aspects of tourism are associated with the rural environment,rsquo she says.Wildle and a wild landscape are what wellness-tourists are seeking - Scotland with its scenery fits the bill perfectly. Again, this could all help spread tourism around the country rather than leaving it concentrated in a few hot spots and cities.Chris Greenwood, head of research with VisitScotland, says wellness lsquois the big growth area. Itrsquos indicative of the way society globally is going, people feel more stressedrsquo. Successful tourism follows the lestyles people aspire to. This wellness trend can also help with another problem when it comes to the balance of Scottish tourism - that wersquore not a lsquoyear roundrsquo destination as yet - wersquore still dependent on those vital summer months.Wellness could transform something like Scotlandrsquos Dark Skies tourism - which sees travellers star-gazing in places like Dumfries and Galloway - from a niche activity to an all year round staple of the industry. GREEN TOURISMlsquoVisitors want to enrich their lives and this is expressed through concerns about the environment,rsquo says Greenwood. lsquoThey want to be seen as travellers, not tourists - they want to meet local people and see the real country.rsquo Green tourism is yet another driver of widening tourist destinations across the country.Greenwoodrsquos boss, Malcolm Roughead, chief executive of VisitScotland, says lsquosustainabilityrsquo is one of the big buzz words in tourism today. lsquoHow good would it bewe were the first country in the world to come out with an energy efficient way of getting round the North Coast  rsquo Roughead asks. lsquoOrwe could link up charging points and electric vehicles with rail travel rsquoThe idea of using green transport in Scotland as a way of lsquomitigating carbon emissions as a kind of paybackrsquo for visitors who have made longhaul flights to holiday in Scotland, would be attractive to consumers in our increasingly green world, says Roughead.Scotlandrsquos wild weather even adds to the appeal when it comes to green tourism. It feels rugged, it accentuates nature. lsquoOur location just adds to our attraction,rsquo says Greenwood. THE HAND OF THE STATEHigh VAT and the cost of non-domestic rates are hurting tourist businesses, says Dr Andrew Martin of the Scottish Centre for Tourism. lsquoTherersquos good money to be made in the industry, however currently the winners are the government and the country as we are delivering jobs and money into the economy, but the operators could do with help,rsquo he says.Martin feels lsquoanti-businessrsquo policies need addressed. Some tourist companies need relief to stay in business, he says. Dr Majory Brewster says: lsquoMost of the businesses involved in tourism are micro and small organisations, but they bring in substantial amounts of money for the country.rsquo They need support, she says. lsquoThings can be quite challenging. Therersquos a high percentage which donrsquot last more than two years.rsquo BREXITEveryone in Scottish tourism fears Brexit. The industry depends on foreign workers. lsquoBrexit creates a shadow,rsquo says Professor John Lennon. Both tourists and foreign workers worry lsquowill I get inrsquo, he says. lsquoTourism is quite fragile,rsquo Lennon adds. lsquoIf people think there is any uncertainty about visiting a destination they will chose not to go. Itrsquos an emotional industry, it is not based on logic.rsquoBrexit is affecting investment. If the pound tanks foreign workers wonrsquot just leave because of the unwelcome atmosphere in the UK, theyrsquoll leave because they can earn more money in another country. Food prices could rocket in the event of Brexit as well. Costs will be passed on to consumers like tourists.lsquoWe need to make very clear to the international market that at least Scotland,not the UK, is open for business,rsquo says Prof Lennon. lsquoLetrsquos stand above this narrow-minded parochial nonsense that is Brexit.rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"funding-boost-for-childrens-social-media-advice-service","story":"The Scottish Youth Parliament and the Childrenrsquos Parliament are developing the national resource produced by and for children and young people.It is part of a package of measures to improve the mental health of young people, funded by the Scottish Government.Mental Health Minister Clare Haughey said:ldquoSocial media does have the potential to be used in a hugely positive way, but we want to ensure young people are properly informed on how social media promotes unrealistic expectations.ldquoWe also want young people to know what the healthy use of social media s looks like.

The experiment left the writer feeling ldquonauseous, ldquoshaky and ldquogrim ndash and Dr David Katz, founding director of the Yale-Grfin Prevention Research Centre, condemned what he called ldquosilly and irresponsible reporting.The new caffeine study ndash by Queen Mary University of Londonndash had, after all, only claimed that drinking large quantities of coffee does not, as previously believed, put pressure on the heart by stfening the arteries. And as Katz pointed out, that doesnrsquot make it safe, with insomnia, high blood pressure and heart rate all possible effects of ldquoextreme coffee consumption.The British Heart Foundationndash which co-funded the QMUL research ndash also seemed annoyed by what it called ldquomisleading reports and released a statement pointing out its study had never suggested ldquounlimited coffee has no effect on cardiovascular health.Having read QMULrsquos initial press release, however, it doesnt come as a surprise that the reports were so dramatic, because it stated ldquodrinking coffee, including in people who drink up to  cups a day, is not associated with having stfer arteries. The explanation for this statistic, which came further down the release, was more nuanced.The ,-person study had been ided into three groups: ldquoThose who drink less than one cup a day, those who drink between one and three cups a day and those who drink more than three, explained the release. ldquoPeople who consumed more than  cups of coffee a day were excluded, but no increased stfening of arteries was associated with those who drank up to this high limit when compared with those who drank less than one cup a day. Even the higher-drinking group averaged only five cups a day.The aim of the research, BHF medical director Professor Metin Avkiran said later, was to better understand coffeersquos impact on the heart and circulatory system. ldquoThere are several conflicting studies, he added, ldquoand it can be dficult to filter what we should believe and what we shouldnrsquot.Hersquos right about that. The advice on caffeine is that around mgis a recommended safe level. Last weekrsquos dramatic headlines may have gladdened the hearts of the nationrsquos baristas, but they also provoked grumbles over yet another apparent reversal of received scientic wisdom.ldquoWersquove lsquobeanrsquo had! chortled the Daily Mail, above a column asking why, oh why, do the ldquohealth nannies get it so wrong  In previous eras, complained columnist Rose Price, butter and eggs have been subjected to ldquowitch-hunts by the ldquoheart health police only for advice to be ldquospectacularly overturned.She has a point. Dozens of foods, from eggs, butter and full-fat milk to wine, chocolate and turmeric, have been condemned, rehabilitated and damned again ndash sometimes repeatedly. Nor is Price alone in being irritated by all these apparent U-turns. Professor Michael Lean, chair of human nutrition at Glasgow University, describes yo-yoing food messages as ldquoa constant bugbear and ldquoa major obstacle to improving health.So why does it happen  Partly, he suggests, itrsquos because our ldquoobsession with health and diet means wersquore ever ready to blame ailments on our food ndash and while the boring truth is ldquotherersquos no drama attached to nutrition and the improvements that can be made are quite small, we are hungry for evidence that consuming more of one product or less of another will have radical effects.And there is no shortage of research scientists happy to oblige. ldquoThere are people in certain universities, especially in America, who crave publicity because thatrsquos how they get their research funds, says Lean, adding that the press is also ldquovery keen to amply anything that seems contentious.More humdrum research confirming what scientists already know is less likely to get reported. As a result, we only see reports that seem to conflict with what we were previously told.Caffeine seems particularly prone to this, partly, says Lean, because itrsquos ldquothe most valuable cash crop in America after oil ... And the minute you put something in about coffee, somebody will say the opposite.Studies that log eating habits against incidence of disease are notoriously unreliable, he says, quoting an old adage that ldquojust because % of people die within an hour of drinking a cup of tea doesnrsquot mean the tea has killed you.Likewise, people who drink more coffee may seem to suffer more from certain complaints. ldquoBut people who drink more coffee tend to smoke more ndash or at least, they did in the past. So thatrsquos a clear confounding factor. There are all sorts of reasons why survey data has to be interpreted with great caution.Even scientic journals arenrsquot always balanced ndash particularly on the emotive subject of sugar, says Lean. Research by his department showed a study linking sugar with disease is ldquomore likely to get publication in a good journal than one which shows therersquos no effect. ldquoTherersquos bias that runs right through the [scientic] journals, he adds.What, then, can a confused member of the public believe  Lean reminds us that official healthy eating guidelines have generally been produced by generations of scientists assessing ldquothe totality of research evidence.Dramatic studies suggesting shortbread will shorten your le or lettuce will let you live forever should be taken with a pinch of salt ndash a small one though, as scientists canrsquot agree over how much sodium is too much.Shaky groundsIn the s, coffee was blamed for causing sexual promiscuity but it was later hailed as a health food said to aid digestion, relieve coughs and prevent everything from gout to miscarriage. In , the Womenrsquos Petition Against Coffee claimed it caused impotence but by the s it was being promoted as a stimulant that helped people work longer. In subsequent centuries the drink was iously accused of causing blindness, stunting growth and hampering academic study.In the s, high coffee intakewas linked to heart attacks and high blood pressure but more recently itrsquos been claimed caffeine consumption can reduce the risk of everything from melanoma to Alzheimerrsquos disease. Last year, a review of scientic literature published in the British Medical Journal concluded that drinking three or four cups of black coffee a day provided health benefits but it also linked large quantities consumed during pregnancy to low birth-weight babies and stillbirths.The latest research, by QMUL, suggests coffee does not, as previously believed, put pressure on the heart by stfening the arteries. Butyou want to toast that news, dont do it with  espressos.Judged spreadsAlthough butter was long considered healthy, in the late th century concern about saturated fats impact on cholesterol levels led to a switch to margarines marketed as ldquohigh in polyunsaturates.Butter has since enjoyed a renaissance and as Glasgow Universityrsquos Michael Lean explains, the saturated fats in dairy produce dfer from those found in meats and donrsquot have the same effect on cholesterol. Healthy eating guidelines ldquoglossed over that distinction, and while Lean understands the need to simply complex nutritional physiology, he says scientists ldquogot it wrong basically by lumping all saturated fats together.Margarine itself fell from grace a few years ago over the potential harmful effects of trans-fatty acids and while commercial spreads have since been modied, sales have plummeted. Meanwhile, the butter vs margarine debate continues.Yolk and mirrorsDuring the s and s, The Egg Marketing Boardrsquos ldquogo to work on an egg slogan promoted this compact, natural foodstuff as a healthy breakfast for hard-working people.Eggs were later vilied for their supposedly high cholesterol content and people were advised to eat no more than two or three a week. Then in , junior health minister Edwina Currie said that ldquomost of the egg production in this country is affected with salmonella ndash and sales nose-ed. Consumer confidence has since been restored and the NHS website now says there is no recommended weekly consumption limit, describing eggs as good sources of protein, vitamins and minerals.The story of EDuring the late th century, health-conscious consumers were obsessed with ldquoE numbers, which referred to the classication of the  preservatives, flavour enhancers and other food additives approved for use in the EU. The system was meant to regulate additives and remove toxins from foods and many of the substances listed on products were harmless .Consumers were suspicious, however, and the flavour enhancer monosodium glutamate or MSGwas one of the biggest bogies, blamed for causing headaches, nausea and numbness: symptoms collectively dubbed ldquoChinese restaurant syndrome because the seasoning was commonly used in those establishments.Washington University researchers conducted experiments that produced stunted growth and sterility in mice and monkeys ndash but subsequent studies, including on humans, failed to repeat the results and today the Food and Drug Administration says the substance is ldquogenerally recognised as safe."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-labour-leader-i-support-self-id-for-trans-people","story":"Leonard said he is broadly relaxed about the proposals for ldquoself-identication, which would scrap the requirement for iniduals to obtain a medical diagnosis from a doctor.However, his stance puts him at odds with some of his left-wing supporters, and his MSPs may get a free vote when it comes to Parliament.Under legislation from , a man or woman is required to obtain a Gender Recognition Certicate before making the change.A certicate can be granteda diagnosis of gender dysphoria has been provided, as well as evidence that a person has lived in their acquired gender for two years.Scottish Government plans would scrap the current system by allowing trans people to self-declare - otherwise known as \"self-id\" - as another gender.Critics of the status quo believe the present system is humiliating and Amnesty have stated: ldquoThe current process by which trans people have their gender legally recognised is dehumanising, long and costly.However, the proposals have angered critics who believe that the rights of women and girls are threatened by a system of self-id.They fear that women-only spaces, such as toilets, and single sex services could be used by men pretending to be trans women.Although First Minister Nicola Sturgeon backs the changes, the SNP is deeply split on the issue.Leonard, whose party is also ided on trans rights, has now echoed the First Ministerrsquos support.On whether he supports the principle of self-identication for trans people, he told this newspaper: ldquoYes, I do.Asked about the concerns expressed by womenrsquos rights campaigners, he said: ldquoThe concern that I have had about the debate is that there has been an attempt to shut down the debate.

They captured a countryrsquos heart with a display of grit, determination and class not always achieved by their male counterparts. Womenrsquos football had arrived north of the border.: The Scotland game as it happenedldquoScotland did us proud tonight, declared super-fan and team patron Nicola Sturgeon from the stadium. ldquoGreat second half performance in particular. I know they will be disappointed not to take a point but so many positives to build on for the next match. Well done and good luck on Friday.]Tfw @ScotlandNT score their first goal in a World Cup!! @brennajessie_#OurGirlsOurGame #SCO pic ULLvnRHPWHThe First Minister was talking about a clash with Japan later this week in the Breton capital of Rennes. After that, a showdown with Argentina. Manager Shelley Kerr - newly recognised by the Queen with an MBE in another symbol of womenrsquos footballrsquos new status - was also looking forward, not back. And she thinks ldquoOur Lassies have to win just one of those games to do what Scottish boys have never done: qualy out of the group stages of the World Cup.Ms Kerr was having none of the post-match remonstration of the menrsquos game, evena penalty, granted using VAR video technology, had made the dference between her side and England.ldquoIrsquove watched the penalty three times and I thought it was a bit harsh, but the rules are the rules, Kerr said. ldquoWhat I want to do now is applaud the players for the second-half display.Shelley KerrThe Scotland coach praised her opponents. ldquoThey are ranked third in the world for a reason and there is no doubt they are a formidable team, she said. ldquoThe penalty probably dented our confidence a wee bit, but all credit to the players, they regrouped after half time and thatrsquos what theyrsquove done throughout the campaign.Fans like this style. And quickly contrasted it to the tone struck by the unhappy England manager, a man, Phil Neville, who turned up for the game in a waistcoat like the one sported by coach Gareth Southgate at last yearrsquos male World Cup.Supporter Susan Stewart tweeted: ldquoAnd isnrsquot Shelley Kerr a class act! Acknowledges officials have a dficult job, refuses to criticise VAR, congratulates England and clearly focused on next game. Contrast with Phil Neville...MENSGAME:Steve Clarke praises his players for battling back from the brink of a Euro  exitSundayrsquos match had come after unprecedented build-up for womenrsquos football. Newspapers and TV have celebrated the teamrsquos stars. Women denied caps for past appearances have been recognised. It has been a slog. Herald columnist and football fan Kevin McKenna summed it up this weekend. ldquoThere remains a residual animosity to the concept of womenrsquos football as mainstream, he wrote. ldquoIt follows a depressingly predictable narrative which dictates that women, no matter how skilful, lack the sheer brute strength to propel a football at speed or to remain physically robust for  minutes in the modern game. This isnrsquot sexist just stupid.FULL TIME | England - Scotland.Claire Emslie scored a second half consolation, but it is a narrow defeat for #SWNT in our opening match.Up next, Rennes as we take on Japan on Friday ##ENGSCO pic WRrOKUPzETimes change. Now the national womenrsquos team plays at Hampden, securing a record crowd for their last home game. There are murals across the country of the teams stars.

Prior to setting sail on the MV Boudicca to Bayeux with Poppyscotland today, he posed for a stunning portrait to highlight his own personal story of that fafetful day,  years ago.John said: “My most vivid memory was the Armada of ships lying off-shore. They stretched for as far as the eye could see. “We waited for what seemed like an interminable amount of time before we could go on shore. We felt like easy targets for the Luftwaffe. \u2028“A couple of ships were hit and we just hoped and prayed that ours would not be one of the next ones. “For some reason, I remember that I did not even get my feet wet when we eventually came on shore as we were on landing craft vehicles.”Johns most vivid memory of June , , was the Armada of ships lying off-shore.

According to these three parties, the new power supply system — known as #cold ironing# — will reduce the overnight carbon footprint from the vessel’s diesel generators and engines. It is believed that this will lower the ferry#s fuel consumption by at least  tonnes a year and resulting in a signicant reduction in carbon dioxide. It is also hoped that this will make a contribution towards further reducing nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and noise.According to the organisations behind these plans, it will be £, cheaper to service MV Hamnavoe each year, as a result of the project. £, of funding was secured for the scheme from the European Regional Development Fund in August last year, with additional funding coming from OIC#s Miscellaneous Piers and Harbours fund and HITRANS.The scheme is expected to fully pay for itself in three years’ time through efficiencies and cost savings.Organisations behind the project say that other benefits will include the installation of an electric bus charger at the ferry terminal to open up opportunities for an electric vehicle to be used on the Stromness to Kirkwall route. There are also plans for the installation of electric vehicle charging points, as well as  electric bicycles for use by members of the public.For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For several minutes she spins and twists, her long hair touching the floor as she tips upside down. Some of the men look on goggle-eyed, others barely glance in her direction. But Melinda’s performance is strangely self-contained detached from the attention or inattention of others .Tucked away in Mitchell Lane, Diamond Dolls announces itself brashly with a vertical neon sign in which the two “Os” are jewels. A doorman explains the rules to newbies: “£ entry. No touching the girls. No propositioning the girls.” Then he ushers us in.We climb a flight of stairs. On the wall are two framed T-shirts. One – with a picture of a penis – reads: “Another satisfied customer” the other bears the legend: “Diamond Dolls Showbar: Stag Party HQ.” The club itself is neither particularly glamorous nor particularly sleazy. The bar – which today is offering cheap beer at £. a bottle and shots for £. – is back-lit in neon pink while retro mirror balls cast flecks of light across the ceiling and walls.The clientele is mixed. A group of noisy young lads has commandeered one alcove the remainder is mainly small groups of three or four. One man, who appears to have wandered off the set of The Inbetweeners, has come alone. The girls are a mixed bunch too. I count  of them altogether. Most are Scottish and could be students, but there are also a couple of Eastern Europeans.When they are not dancing, the girls mingle. The men buy them drinks, chat, then slip into a side booth or behind a curtain for a private dance after which the girls move on. It’s a complicated mating ritual, with no hope of consummation. I find myself gazing at a woman’s splayed buttocks because – thanks to new legislation – “Lap Dancing: a source of empowerment or a form of oppression ” is once again a hot topic for debate. Diamond Dolls is just one of many lap dancing clubs in Scotland. Glasgow has three more: Forbidden, Platinum Lace and Seventh Heaven Edinburgh, of course, has the “Pubic Triangle” at the intersection between Bread Street and Lauriston Street, where Burke and Hare, Baby Dolls No  Showbar and the Western Bar all compete for business. Dundee has Private Eyes. At present, such clubs are largely unregulated. Because they require only alcohol licences, local authorities are unable to attach conditions to the lap dancing side of the businesses. This was tested after Glasgow City Council rejected a licence application from Spearmint Rhino – then running a venue on Drury Street – on the grounds that two of the women had removed their bikini bottoms and that there had been considerable contact with customers, both of which breached the licensing board’s code of conduct.But in  the Court of Session ruled the code of conduct had no statutory basis and that issues around the regulation of lap dancing had nothing to do with the sale of alcohol. In the wake of this, the Scottish Government re-examined existing legislation. It believes that – like prostitution, pornography and human trafficking – lap dancing is a form of violence against women. In , it introduced the Air Weapons and LicensingAct which allowscouncils to introduce Sexual Entertainment Venuelicences and to cap the number of licences allowed in their authority area. Putatively the cap could be set at zero. Cosla and several women’s groups support a ban, though any move to close existing premises would most likely be challenged through the courts. The Act came into force earlier this year, with guidance published on  April. Last week, Glasgow City Council became the first council to launch a public consultation into its lap dancing clubs. It is seeking views on whether to introduce SEVs and,so, what conditions should be attached. It also wants to know how many –any – lap dancing clubs should be allowed, and what issues should be taken into account in considering where they should be sited.The consultation is to last  weeks in the hopes of gathering as wide a range of views as possible. The council appears to be treading carefully because it knows the issue is likely to prove contentious. The Scottish Government is by no means alone in its view of lap dancing clubs as inherently exploitative. In , Iceland became the first country in the world to ban lap dancing and strip clubs for feminist rather than religious reasons. Under prime minister Johanna Sigurdardottir, it became illegal for any business to profit from the nudity of its employees. Such views are prevalent in Scotland too. When a lap dancing club called Sin was given the go-ahead to open in Kirkcaldy last year, former SNP councillor Marie Penman formed the group Women Together Fe to fight it.Penman believes lap dancing fosters the sexually-entitled attitudes of some men, including those who regularly cat-call her -year-old daughter.“I had strong opinions on this anyway, but then the local MSP [David Torrance] saidit brought jobs to the local area he thought it was a good thing,” she says. “It really riled me he thought being a lap dancer was a decent job with no contract, no fixed pay, no pension – it seemed outrageous.”Not everyone agrees, however. There are plenty of women, including lap dancers, who see it as a positive way to express their sexuality and earn a living they believe a ban would be an erosion of personal choice.Mandy Rose Jones first started lap dancing in Glasgow in , came away from it for six years, then went back for a year between  and . The first time round, she kept her job a secret, but, now the consultation is under way, she feels it is important to be forthright about her opposition to a ban.“I started because I was a student and wanted to earn a bit of extra money,” she says. “I found it a positive working environment, there’s a sisterhood among the girls, and I was working a lot less hours than my friends.“People seem to think it’s a massively misogynistic environment and that is not my experience.”She says a ban on lap dancing clubs would leave many of those who work there on the poverty line. “Those women could end up in precarious situations because they have lost their jobs,” she says.This is how most lap dancing clubs work: the women pay a nightly fee to work in the club then they dance round the pole for free to entice customers. They receive only the money spent on private dances: usually £ or £ a shot.Everyone agrees that on a good night, lap dancers can make good money. But on a very bad night they can go home with nothing. The evening I was in Diamond Dolls, there seemed too few customers for  girls. The club can’t lose. If it charges each dancer £ a nightthen it has guaranteed takings of £. All the risk is on the girls.As far as contact with the customers is concerned, the dancers I spoke to were adamant the rules are strictly enforced and that there was no cross-over from lap dancing to prostitution. There are cameras in every booth, they said, and in any case,the girls were willing to be escorts, then why would they bother with lap dancing But health workers I spoke to weren’t so sure. They said the cubicles for private dances were so small touching was almost inevitable and that they have encountered women who have worked as both lap dancers and escorts.Elizabeth Row, , is a student at the Glasgow School of Art creating work around cultural concepts of femininity and the male gaze but for around a decade, she worked in lap dancing bars in Edinburgh.“I came from a nice, middle-class background, so I suppose it was that element of being constrained in a traditional and conservative household,” she says. “We never talked about sexuality. I always knew my sexuality and my body wasn’t wrong because obviously it existed for me as a biological fact, but I didn’t like that it felt wrong so I was intrigued by the prospect of being in an environment that seemed to me quite liberating. An environment where I wouldn’t be judged and where I could earn the money I needed.”So did it prove as liberating as she’d hoped  Well yes. And No. “I consented to being objectied in the context of the lap dancing clubs – and I enjoyed it,” she says. “I think maybe the reason I enjoyed it is because there are so few examples of women being unashamed of their body, and confident in their sexuality, so it felt novel. When I am giving a guy a lap dance, it’s almost like he is just a prop for my self expression. I’m not necessarily aroused by the situation, but I enjoy being naked and the moving of my body to the music. And I suppose, as I dance, I am a prop for him too.”Yet the potential for female self-expression is undermined by the way the clubs are run and by culturally-embedded misogyny which shapes the way the women who work there are perceived.“In lap dancing clubs, you are technically self-employed, yet you are still treated like an employee,” Row says.“You can be fined for being late, forced to work extra shts, and they can suddenly change the amount they want to charge you because they feel like it’s been a profitable night – although it may not have been profitable for everyone.“It is easy for things like this to be brushed under the carpet because “who cares about the sluts ” and no one complains because we feel like it is just the way it goes.“The management will say: ‘You make so much money why would you care about having to pay a bit of extra now and again ’ but the issue is not how much money you are making but the fact you are being taken advantage of by a mainly male establishment which quite frankly wouldn’t have a businessit weren’t for you.”Row says, in her experience, the clubs are mostly safe. “There are bouncers whose job it is to look after you,” she says, “but it depends on which club you are in. Sometimes bouncers are quite attached to the club and,you are a dancer who is going to kick up too much fuss, you are less inclined to get the protection you need even though you are in the right. Ora customer is a big spender they might not be removed from the club eventhey have physically or verbally assaulted you, but again you can’t complain about it no-one cares.“Most of the time you are safe, though, because the other women will always have your back. A very deep bond develops between you, even though you might not be friends in other circumstances, because you all understand what it’s like to work in this industry.”Row – who went back into education at  – says deep-seated sexism leads men to see women who are strippers as “damaged” and outside social norms.“But the strip clubs are not the issue. If you try to shut them down all you are going to be doing is putting a plaster over bigger, more pressing issues. Men should not be horrible to women regardless of whether they are strippers or prostitutes they should not be horrible to women full stop. “We should be educating men, not taking away employment and employment opportunities for students and caregivers and women who refuse to work for minimum wage and who, quite frankly, just like having loads of money – and there is nothing wrong with that.”Row was dancing in the now-closed Sapphire Rooms in Edinburgh when photographer Jannica Honey was commissioned to take photographs of the girls who worked there back in . Honey, who is Swedish, spent four months getting to know them and taking pictures of them in the dressing room and while performing.“Whenever people talk about lap dancers, it’s either sad-assed stripper or empowered woman there’s never a middle ground,” she says. “You hear about students at college making shit-loads of money, but I think it is a bit of a myth. I do know someone who made enough to buy a flat in Edinburgh at an early age. But I also remember a woman who had paid to dance and she wasn’t getting any customers. So she got more and more frantic. Then the customers said: ‘Oh, she is desperate’ so they weren’t interested and at the end of the night she was out of pocket.“I’m Swedish. I don’t care about getting naked, but what kind of a job is it where you pay to go to work, you work all those late hours and you still could leave without making anything As for the prospect of cleaning the industry up, Honey is dubious. “One lap dancer said to me that men who go to strip clubs get turned on by the seediness of it, the secret shame-based element,” she says. “I think that’s important. It’s a liminal space where anything can unfold so it can’t just be a regular job. It’s just not within its nature. It’s not what people subconsciously want.”With so much heat in the lap dancing debate and, to be frank, no mounting public clamour for a crackdown, there is a palpable frustration over the Scottish Government’s decision to question its morality, while delegating all the tough judgments to the local authorities.It is the local authorities, not the Government, that will be caught in the cross-fire between those who see the sexual entertainment industry as legitimateand those who see it as an inherent wrong.It is the local authorities that will have to pick their way through the complexities of human sexuality and power dynamics and mull over the philosophical questions of choice, self-expression and exploitation. In the meantime, back at Diamond Dolls, Thursday night has tipped into Friday morning. The lad from The Inbetweeners is chatting intimately with one of the girls. Were it not for her outfit, they could easily be a couple. As they head off for a private dance, I make for the women’s toilets which are used as a changing room by the girls. Beside the basins lies a cluster of toiletries. Hairspray, mouthwash, a few toothbrushes in a tumbler: all quotidian reminders of the ordinary lives behind the vampy personas.By the time I , the private dance is over. The lad is back at the bar.

What you have counted was the Leave without a deal of any type vote  and your figure of  includes voters who may care nothing about the EU but are considering a host of other reasons for casting their vote.LOL The London Liberals’ view of democracy:“Dear plebs, we’re honouring you by asking your advice on which of two options # Leave or Remain # you want us to adopt .” 🙂Alternative description of London Liberals:They made it % clear that they want to withdraw Article  and remain in the EU.They expressed this view in language that was so clear that not a single person could misunderstand them.Millions of London plebs agreed with them and voted Liberal, so they won the election.If you saw anything dferent John, I suspect your moving picture wireless needs re-tuning.Would you say the same about the SNP in Scotland, Malcolm Still thinking about it, Malc Not at all Brian.There’s nothing to think about.I replied to you immediately but I forgot to gentry my working-class language, so it wasn’t published.The Lib Dems in London and the SNP in Scotland had a very similar policy on Article  and EU membership.The SNP had clearly planned their strategy well in advance and provided clear guidance to their supporters who knew exactly what they were voting for.Why did that make you swear Liebe Rosa, you’ve fairly thrown down the gauntlet there!I agree, each translation has issues, but happily help is at hand within Shetland culture. Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst. I think these lines from the closing verse of The Galley Song capture Schiller’s intention perfectly:O’er stre the curtain drawHappy to see Europe inspiring Shetland still!#Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us#Unless of course they#re English eh Peter. You want to separate scotland from the rest of the UK yet come out with the PC BS above. just who are you trying to kid I wondered when the anti- English racist rhetoric would raise its ugly head on here. Rule Britannia was actually written by Thomas Arne a Roman Catholic who was proud to be British. He’d get short shrt on the so called Liberal Shetland Islands.The first  notes of Beethoven#s Fth. Lest we forget how Europe became free.And there is a big world out there we don#t need Europepo founded , napoleon long dead by then. liberals to replace lairds  look at tavish family historyThe original company originates from , with the formation of the Peninsular  Oriental Steam Navigation Company, Napolean not long dead . Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago. Have you someone a little more contemporary to bore us with  Tony Benn had some creative thoughts about Europe, as did Jack Jones. They were real socialists and Democrats, not pretentious windbags. Now carry on spouting, Liebe Rosa, will be most impressed. # made me realise how cushioned from the worst excesses of Tory Lib-Dem austerity we are in Scotland: free prescriptions, no bedroom tax and – of vital important to many state benefit recipients – universal credit payment choices, to name but three. This of course, was reflected in Shetland’s EU election result. My friend is planning on early retirement and swt relocation to pro-Europe Shetland.In that same spirit, and reflecting on Northern Ireland’s and Scotland’s situation, I found myself wondering how someone might feeltheir favourite pub, which offers a decent selection of bar meals, was to be burned down by their dour in-laws who run the bog standard cafe next door, all in order to secure wider access to the market.These words were in the context of his apologising to the Roma people for Catholic discrimination.They sit in contrast to Farage’s racist and isive comments regarding Romanians that some people willingly overlook.

Students have learnt about the aquacultures along the tidal zones of Skye and food practices that can support them.During the summer, three graduates of the course have been awarded a Climavore apprenticeship in restaurants across Skye and Raasay # Edinbane Lodge, Raasay House, and Scorrybreac Restaurant. Working in close collaboration with the chefs and kitchen teams, the apprentices will develop, prepare and serve Climavore dishes to support and develop alternative aquacultures that promote cleaner usage of the tidal zone.The programme will be launched with a celebratory meal on Saturday st June at the oyster table in Portree. Prepared in partnership with the pupils, diners will be treated to a lunch of scallop ceviche, oysters, seaweed soup and carrageen panna cotta, washed down with a Harris Gin and sea buckthorn cocktail.Events on Sunday nd June will include a walk to a rare native Skye oyster habitat, which will be followed by a screening of the recently-released film #Artishal# at the Aros Centre in Portree. Produced by Patagonia, #Artishal# is a film about people, rivers, and the fight for the future of wild fish and the environment that supports them. The film screening will be followed by a discussion led by environmentalist Corin Smith.Alon Schwabe of Cooking Sections explained why he believed this project was so vital. He said: #All across the Scottish isles, the United Kingdom and across the planet we are witnessing a tremendous loss of bioersity and extensive pollution of our air, land, and waterways. In the UK and all around the world, the environments we leave to future generations are in a fragile state.#Climavore questions how we eat as humans changes climate and develops programmes to provide tools to young residents of Skye to transform food practices, ecologies and environments to become better places for humans, plants and animals living along the tidal zone.#Atlas Arts producer Shona Cameron added: #Working with the students and teachers at Portree High School over the last year has been an exciting development for this project. The students have shown real enthusiasm to learn about the local ingredients and engage in conversations that question sustainability.#It has been brilliant to see restaurants across the islands continue to show enthusiasm towards the aims of Climavore and demonstrate a willingness to take on apprentices, working with them to bring Climavore dishes to their menus.

In  its final report included “proposed actions” for Ministers to adopt or pursue in order to lessen theeffects of households having to spend more than  per cent of their incomes onheat and light.Housing minister Kevin Stewart told the Free Press thetask force’s report and recommendations have “helped inform the development ofthe Fuel Poverty Bill and draft strategy”, alongside other signicantstakeholder engagement, including the first ever Islands Communities ImpactAssessment.He added: “Scotland is one of the few countries in theworld to define fuel poverty and set a goal towards eradicating it. By changingthe definition of fuel poverty so it’s more closely aligned to relative incomepoverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and islandcommunities, we are ensuring our support is focused on those who need it most.”A spokeswoman for Mr Stewart also said that “tacklingand prioritising extreme fuel poverty” – where households have to spend over per cent of their income on heat and light – was the first priority of the newBill. New definitions of both fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty arecurrently being worked on.She added: “Our proposals in the Fuel Poverty Billwill align fuel poverty more closely with low income. Scotland is among only ahandful of European countries to define fuel poverty, let alone set targets relatingto its eradication. Our proposal to use the Minimum Income Standard isimportant and innovative and more closely aligns fuel poverty with low income.The UK Minimum Income Standard, used in the new definition of fuel poverty inthe Fuel Poverty Bill, takes account of the additional costs associated withliving in remote and island communities by applying an uplt for remote ruralareas and remote small towns, and, separately for island areas.

The late Peter McCambridge won his Distinguished Conduct Medal on the Longest Day - but he had, in fact, dropped into Normandy in the late evening of June , .Anyone who has seen the film of The Longest Day will remember the scenes featuring Richard Todd and the Glider troops of the Oxs and Bucks Light Infantry attacking Pegasus Bridge.Mr. McCambridge, then an NCO with the thParachute Btn. of the th Airborne Division, was fighting only yards from this famous action in the nearby village of Le Port.In later years, Peter McCambridge was a familiar figure in Ballymena. He lived at Wilson Crescent and was a keen walker. Few,any, would have known that the tall, bespectacled figure who went about his civilian le so quietly and modestly was one of the heroes of D-Day.This is what his citation recorded about the action:-  Unit : B Company, th Parachute Battalion. Service No. : . Awards : Distinguished Conduct Medal‘This NCO was one of the parachute troops who landed behind the German lines in Normandy on the night th th June . During the fighting for Beacutenouville bridge on the th June, McCambridges platoon was responsible for holding the village of Le Port. At one period his section became detached from the platoon and the fighting, which went on for  hours almost without pause, was particularly fierce. McCambridge noticed that one house dominated the scene of the fighting. By skilful use of a smoke grenade and displaying the greatest dash he got his section across a road swept by Machine Gun fire and into the house. He used anti-tank grenades to smash open the garden gate and the door of the house. Once inside the house he was completely cut off from the rest of his company, who actually had withdrawn slightly, but he was in a dominating position and became the target for the enemy who greatly outnumbered his section and were surrounding him. So well did he dispose his men however and so splendid was his leadership that he held this isolated house until the seaborne troops eventually entered the village from the other end, several hours later. At times the enemy were close enough to try and beat down the door by beating it with their rle butts - McCambridge dealt with such attacks by having grenades dropped on them from the upper windows. There is no doubt that the holding of this dominating house seriously weakened the enemy attacks and greatly assisted the battalion to carry out its job of holding the bridge. On the th June at Bois de Bavent during a company attack Sgt McCambridge, together with another NCO, saved the le of his platoon commander, who had been wounded and whose phosphorus bomb was burning in his pouch. Between them they extracted the burning bomb and dragged the officer to cover despite heavy and accurate mortar and Machine Gun fire.McCambridge has shown himself throughout the three weeks continuous fighting to be a truly magnicent NCO. He is calm, cheerful and always reliable.

The Amateurs celebrated reaching the historic milestone by holding a gala sports dinner at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel in Ballynahinch“Sixty years is a long time for a Junior or indeed an Intermediate club to keep going, especially in the modern day when there are so many other attractions,” said Mr Martin.He revealed that the Irish FA was working on a strategy to reverse the nationwide decline in the adult game, and hoped that the Amateurs would themselves benefit from this plan in the near future.Over  members, friends and former players of Dromore Amateurs enjoyed a fantastic evening at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel, Ballynahinch on April  as the club celebrated in fine style its th anniversary.Formed at the beginning of the   season, the Amateurs have maintained football in the Co Down town for six decades.Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, presents a crystal vase to Amateurs chairman Russell WardAs well as the president of the Irish FA, special guests on the night included Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, and Maurice Johnston, vice chairman of the Mid Ulster Football League.Dromore played in the Northern Amateur Football League from  to  and again from  to , before moving to the Mid Ulster Football League where they currently play in the Intermediate B Division.The compere and after-dinner speaker was BBC legend Jackie Fullerton, whose wit and charm throughout the evening brought much fun and laughter.The Ballymena man’s tales about sporting icons George Best, Joey Dunlop and Alex Higgins went down a storm with the audience.Mid Ulster Football League representatives Maurice Johnston, vice chairman, left, and Stephen Magill, honorary secretary, right, make a presentation to Russell Ward, chairman of Dromore AmateursMr Fullerton was the perfect gentleman with all he met, mingling with guests and accommodating every request for a photograph or a selfie with good grace.SpeechesThe Amateurs’ hard-working committee was delighted to secure the attendance of such a prestigious guest as the president of Irish FA.Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even further Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"However, the pleasure was reciprocated because, of course, Mr Martin is an Amateurs old boy himself.Top goalscorer and first team player of the year Matthew Reain, centre, withcoach Keith Halliday and manager Graeme DavisHe spent  years with the club as a player and club treasurer.“I receive many invitations over the course of a year but this is one which gives me so much pleasure in being able to attend,” Mr Martin told the audience. “It was Mountview Park in  when I joined the club.“I was a second team player. Robert Gracey, Sam Vint, Aubrey Davidson, Wyn Crothers, Brendan Maginess, Philip Roy, Bernie Mackin, John Toucher and, of course, so many others, were my teammates.“They were great times, great moments. We weren’t successful, however these guys were fine clubmen.“I was treasurer from  to . We developed the clubhouse and upgraded the pitch and surroundings. We put the club on a sound financial footing before I left in  – this was achieved from a less-than-zero position in .“Suffice to say, this is where I began as a football administrator and I have always been grateful to the club for that.”Commenting on the Amateurs’ exciting plans for a new pitch and clubrooms, Mr Martin said the future was looking bright for his old club. He brought the best wishes of the Irish FA and on their behalf presented a crystal bowl to Dromore chairman Russell Ward to mark the occasion.Indeed, Mr Ward was a busy man on the night.In addition to making two fine speeches himself, the Amateurs chairman was presented with a further two pieces of crystal from Mr Pateman and Mr Johnston. Both league officials made excellent speeches during which they brought the best wishes of their respective organisations and paid generous compliments to Dromore on reaching their th anniversary.AuctionA highlight of the evening was the auction of sporting memorabilia. Hospitality tickets for a Northern Ireland game, signed shirts from Ulster Rugby and Linfield FC, and signed footballs from Rangers FC and Manchester United, all sold for very respectable sums.However, a titanic bidding war took place over a signed Liverpool FC football and the atmosphere in the room was electric as the figure kept getting higher and higher.When the auctioneer, Mr Fullerton, eventually brought the hammer down and declared ‘sold’, it was Amateurs committee member and local businessman Darren McCauley who became the new owner of the prized football.He might have paid an eye-watering amount, but being a lelong Liverpool fan and a great Dromore clubman, Mr McCauley was delighted with his purchase – and with Liverpool having won the Champions League final at the weekend, it now looks like a clever investment.With the formalities over, it was time for the band to take to the stage, and five-piece Klass proved a big hit, packing the dancefloor until the finish.AwardsThe final act of the   season came on Saturday, May  with a charity match between current players and a team of Amateurs “legends”.An entertaining game was played in a friendly but competitive spirit at the Community Centre.The youthful legs of the current players proved too much for the wise old heads of the legends. However, a clever tactical decision to play the last  minutes with  players on the pitch helped the old boys finish the game with a respectable - defeat.It was wonderful to see so many former players come along, pull the boots on and attempt to relive past glories. Special mention goes to Malcolm Hanna, who celebrated his th birthday with a sterling display in midfield.A total of £ was raised for Diabetes UK, with the costs of the day kindly sponsored by Trevor Tate and Son Transport Ltd.Afterwards, the Amateurs held their end-of-season awards presentation in the clubrooms.Chairman Russell Ward expressed his sincere thanks to the coaching staff, players and committee for all their efforts throughout the season.First team player-manager Graeme Davis was praised for guiding the Amateurs to their highest place league finish in many years.Dromore ended the season in fth positionin the Intermediate B Division of the Mid Ulster Football League.Their record was as follows: P W D L Pts .Graeme can be proud of this achievement in his debut season in charge.

The seconds finished eighthin Reserve Division Four.Their record was as follows: P W D L PtsDficult as the season proved, it was still a great learning experience for the younger players. Although there were many ups and downs over the year, the team stuck together and there was a great spirit in the changing room, right up until the last game.The award winners for both teams was dominated by young players – an encouraging sign for the future.The first teams gongs were a family affair, with the Reain brothers, Josh and Matthew, iding up the trophies between them. These two fantastic athletes will be the backbone of the first team for many years to come.Young player of the year was Matthew Briggs, who moved up from youth football and played the entire season in the first team - a tremendous achievement.In the seconds, top goalscorer Jonathan Rodgers only joined midway through the season but he is a great attacking player and is such an exciting prospect. And -year-old Nathan Thompson capped a wonderful season by taking home both the manager’s and players’ player of the year trophies. Nathan is a quiet young man – but on the pitch he makes his presence felt, and is a model defender who rarely makes a mistake.Clubman of the year was the popular Christopher Tate – a committee member and first team coach, Christopher puts his heart and soul into the club.Dromore Amateurs will hold their AGM in the clubrooms on Monday, June  at pm.

If we get Boris Johnson in as Prime Minister, God knows what’s going to happen because that man wants to bring in an amnesty. He will probably call a halt to legacy inquests, so we need to get people out on the streets at the weekend.”She continued: “The inquest won’t answer all of our questions, but at least we’re having it addressed. We had General Mike Jackson in the box who, when my brother and Mr Corr were being thrown into the back of an army vehicle, he stood round the corner saying they had engaged in two-three hour gun battle and had shot dead two gunmen. That has now been exposed – they were unarmed.“We’re  years down the line with our campaign. An inquest is something that every person is entitled to. The right to le is something that people should have in any country.”Mr Laverty’s niece, Mary-Kate Quinn, added: “The Stormont House Agreement was something that people were happy with, but all of the mechanisms are shelved. Sunday is about making sure there is a process for everybody to be involved in and asking for it to be implemented.“The Stormont House Agreement provides people with mechanisms that acknowledge their loved ones. There are people sitting who don’t even know that they have had loved ones murdered – they have no voice.We’re very lucky –you could say that – that we have a process and we’re miles ahead of everybody  because of the inquest.”She continued: “The Ballymurphy campaign and the inquest has given people hope. As a family we would like to think that it gives people hope. When the Bloody Sunday families got the outcome of their investigation it was victory for them, but it was a victory for all of us. I think this march is about hope and about demanding the rights that we’re entitled to.”The Time for Truth March will assemble at pm, Sunday th June at three points, walking to join at Belfast City Hall.

These lines of inquiry do not include the journalists, Mr Birney or Mr McCaffrey, as suspects in the investigation.“At all times, my officers have acted in good faith, within the law and followed due process. The warrant application was originally submitted to and approved by a county court judge. We do, however, accept and respect the decision of the High Court last week.“We plan to produce a final report to the Chief Constable of the PSNI outlining all of our findings.”In response PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said: “In , PSNI became aware of an alleged theft and or unlawful leaking of sensitive documents relating to the Loughinisland investigation from the Office of the Police Ombudsman. To ensure independence and address any conflict of interest I asked Durham Constabulary to conduct the investigation.“I am grateful to Durham Constabulary and to Chief Constable Mike Barton for the work they have conducted on our behalf in this sensitive investigation. I have always accepted the autonomy of Chief Constable Barton’s inquiry and I fully concur with his decision not to progress the investigation into the two journalists Mr Birney and Mr McCaffrey.“Throughout the period of this investigation, the horror of what happened in Loughinisland has never been far from any of our thoughts. The perpetrators of that crime have never been brought to justice and that is a matter of huge regret for policing.“The police investigation into who murdered the six innocent men in the Heights Bar in  remains open but progress is dependent on new information. There are people out there who know what happened. I would appeal to them to come forward and make a statement that will help us finally bring justice to the families of the victims.“I am aware that the investigation over the last year has caused concern for families who have already suffered so much. That is something none of us would ever have wished to do.“However, as a police service, the suspected theft or unlawful leaking of any sensitive documents containing information that may endanger le is a serious matter which we are statutorily obliged to investigate.“Recognising the sensitivities, we asked an independent Police Service to conduct the investigation. The clarity provided by last week’s hearing has now brought a signicant part of that investigation to a conclusion.“I await the final report from Durham on this complex investigation.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tim and jake unveiled as feile comedy leads","story":"NORTH is set to meet West as Belfast’s comedy big hitters come together for Féile an Phobail’s annual comedy night.

I think it reflects well on the school, the pupils and the standards set by staff.\"Mr Skelton said the league table \"shows the success of the grammar school system\" and he added: \"Pastoral care is a massive part of it. We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

It’s fascinating to see where they would like to see money spent – and who would lose out,\" she said.Spend It Like Stormont will air on BBC One Northern Ireland at pm on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"oops sinn fein press advisor accidentally sends mass email asking about redundancy","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Were used to Americans coming over and flattering the Irish with faux praise about how their ancestors built their country. Trump is somewhat dferent, though.Sources say the US President told Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that he always thinks of the Republic as \"a huge country\" because of the impact its people have had. Varadkar happily told him the country has just five million people.It was one of the lighter moments in a meeting that briskly moved from serious topics to sport. Brexit, immigration and all featured, before conversation swayed to The Open. At one point the Irish side found itself explaining how, for some sports, the whole island plays as one team, while for others, there are Republic and Northern Ireland teams. The US President was fascinated. Insiders say the atmosphere was \"warm\", which probably matched the temperature in the makesht meeting room that was dressed up with a few net curtains and colourful flowers. On the American side, Trump had some big hitters, but they didnt throw any punches. There was his Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, National Security Advisor John Bolton and Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin. Varadkars back-up team included his Chief of Staff, Brian Murphy, main Brexit brain John Callinan, US envoy John Deasy and Ambassador Dan Mulhall. Even before the meeting began, it was obvious Trump was in a good mood. He allowed journalists to fire questions at him for eight minutes without trading any insults. He also denied being in Ireland to play golf and promote his hotel but struggled to show that he had done any actual preparation for the meeting. The Taoiseach was brave enough to publicly correct him when he tried to compare the Irish border situation with his plans to build a wall between the US and Mexico. \"His basic knowledge isnt great,\" a source admitted. However, Mr Varadkar insisted afterwards that the purpose of the meeting was to educate the US delegation.Soon, Trump and his we, Melania, were on board a chopper bound for Doonbeg. Irish officials were more than a little relieved. Mr Varadkar went on to defend the cost of providing , unormed and  specialist gardai for the trip. \"The good bilateral relationship between Ireland and America is worth a lot more than €m,\" he said. Trump is unlikely to have taken in much of what was said, but he didnt call anybody, including Michael D Higgins, a stone cold loser. No real damage done, then, which is the best they could have hoped for. There was no mention of wind turbines or fake news. \"I learn from my mistakes,\" the Taoiseach laughed as he left the post-match analysis session.  data-dfpadtargeting and First Lady Melania Trumpdisembark Air Force One upon arrival at Shannon Airport in Shannon, County Clare, Ireland on June , .

I believe we have achieved this outcome with the design incorporating the Mourne mountains, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoI am also pleased that dedicated motorhome bays have been provided in Castle Park and that the spaces are being well used.Cllr Clarke said it was important that the local authority works with motorhome owners as Newcastle and the wider region needed to be a welcoming place for visitors.He added: ldquoIt has to be recognised that displacement of motorhome and camper vans from the Downs Road and Glen River car parks had to be accommodated whereI believe it is essential that

obesity epidemic  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council is aiming to help fight the growing obesity crisis across Northern Ireland.Local politicians are gearing up to declare war on the issue and implement a new policy that will result in high sugar items such as sweets, fizzy drinks and high fat snacks being banned from vending machines in council buildings across the district, including its leisure centres.The high sugar items will be replaced with healthy choice snacks and drinks with local politicians hoping that other organisations across the district, which have vending machines in their buildings, will follow suit.A number of local schools have already banned chocolates and crisps from their vending machines with politicians keen to lead from the front in encouraging people to eat more healthily and exercise regularly.Last year, the local authority launched a new app to make it easier for residents across the district to take part in sport and leisure activities and receive up-to-date information about the local authorityrsquos leisure facilities.Now it wants to go a step further to help improve peoplersquos health.The move to ban high fat and sugary items from vending machines across council buildings, which will be formally discussed later this month, comes after it emerged this week that sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks could soon be sold under cigarette-style plain packaging under plans by a number of leading brands to help combat the obesity epidemic.A recent Department of Health survey revealed that that % of people in Northern Ireland were overweight, with % classed as obese with councillors acutely aware that obesity continues to be one of the most important public health challenges.They recognise that being overweight or obese increases the risk of le threatening disease, with its costs extending far beyond the public sector, affecting iniduals, families, communities, the economy and society as a whole.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority, politicians agreed to debate the possible ban and view the move as an important step towards tacking the obesity issue.They aim to encourage people to opt for healthier food choices and to change their diet as part of the drive to create an environment that supports and promotes a physically active lestyle and healthy diet.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who is spearheading the drive to ban sugary snacks and drinks from council vending machines, said he hopes it will empower people to make healthier choices and reduce the risk of overweight and obesity related diseases.He said tackling childhood obesity was already a public health priority and was keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it could at a time when research suggested that one in four children across the island of Ireland carried excess weight.Cllr Clarke said that without action to reverse current trends, the next generation will be beset with signicant ill-health related issues linked to obesity, most of which are potentially preventable.ldquoI am keen for the local council to introduce a new policy to effectively ban high fat and sugary foods and drinks from vending machines across its facilities and replace them with healthy options, he explained.ldquoI also hope that the local authorityrsquos many partner organisations will follow suit. We do not want to see obesity becoming a social norm and I believe we can help make a dference by exercising greater control over what items are in vending machines in all council buildings.Cllr Clarke said he viewed a ban on sugary snacks and drinks as ldquojust the start of a concerted campaign to help tackle obesity and get people move towards healthier lestyles.ldquoI think it is important that the council takes the lead on an issue which everyone can support. It is essential people signicantly reduce their intake of unhealthy food and drinks, he said.The local councillor also suggested that the local authority should offer politicians healthy options when they arrive for their tea ahead of the monthly council meetings.ldquoHealthy options featuring salads, fruit and vegetables should also be on the menu at council-organised s so people can choose to eat healthily. While I want the council to take the lead on this issue, I hope many other bodies it works alongside will follow suit.ldquoWorking together we can make a dference and help people change their lives. The councilrsquos lead on this issue could have a ripple effect across the district beyond.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThis is not about being a kill joy but encouraging people to be more health conscious when it comes to what they eat and drink and is the first step in a process..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown to DownTime summer festival  ","story":"THE countdown is on for this monthrsquos spectacular DownTime summer festival which has something for everyone.Organisers of the four-day community event mdash which kicks off on June  mdash are promising a sparkling festival of fun which includes two daysrsquo of not-to-be-missed horse racing at the widely acclaimed Downpatrick track.Horse racing first took place at in Downpatrick in  and for almost  years the local track has been constantly improving, boasting great racing, modern facilities, themed race days and a rather unique atmosphere.DownTime summerfest has been organised by a dedicated local team from all sectors of the community whose aim is to get people out and about not just over the four-day festival, but across the summer.Now in its second year, the festival is supported by Newry, Mourne and Down Council and features over  events covering arts, heritage, music, food and, of course, sport.There will be street art, live music, theatre performances, free train rides, a living history Viking encampment at the St Patrick Centre and an artisan market mdash which will be open between am and .pm mdash cradled in the grounds of the Down County Museum.Locals and visitors alike will experience a haven of freshly produced food, bespoke crafts and relaxing surroundings.

Apart from a host of blister complaints, the bulk of real casualties were a handful of people taken to Downe Hospital suffering from heat exhaustion.One woman suffering from exhaustion had to be taken by an RAF helicopter to the Red Cross mobile treatment room and a man, who was knocked unconscious when a small boulder struck him on the head, was also taken to hospital.Despite minor upsets, the whole day was a big success story.

With winter over, during which time many elderly residents were effectively trapped in their homes after dark, the news may not be much consolation for residents.The committee also heard that their plea for a telephone kiosk at Cuan Beach had been refused and that an alternative site has been found for the Toye Kiosk at the New Line.ANNSBOROUGH mdash The youngsters of Annsborough have at last been able to use their new playing fields where a mix-up in the erection of a fence had kept them out for several months. Grazing cattle which have been using the field have been banished to the sidelines behind a new fence.The problem started when Enterprise Ulster erected only one fence at the new playground and forgot about s second fence to keep out nearby cattle.

He started out on his footballing journey as a fresh-faced teenager in the mid s alongside his brother Denis, the McClurgs and Pattersons at Kilmore United, and was an integral part of the embryo that was to become Kilmore Rec.Originally from Inch, just outside Downpatrick, Cyril followed Denis to Killyleagh YCin  and that was the start of a close link with the club that lasted the best part of  years.He spent a decade at The Showgrounds before moving to Drumaness Mills where he again endeared himself to all at Meadowvale with his goals and whole-hearted play.When he hung up his boots in the mid s he bided his time before taking up the role as manager at Drumaness with his pal Paul Gelston mdash he also had managerial spells at Ballynahinch Unitedand Kilmore Rec.However, in  he ed to The Showgrounds to team up with Dee Heron and together they set about building one of the best team sides to play in the Amateur League.They won everything there was to win with the exception of the Intermediate Cup.They lted the Steel  Sons, Border and Clarence Cup with regularity, as well as six Amateur League Premier Section titles in a row.In addition to his time at Killyleagh, Cyril was Heronrsquos assistant with the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team and also teamed up with Nortelrsquos Ricky Beggs as manager of the Amateur League U- youth team for three years.In more recent years Cyril, although he wasnrsquot attached to any club, still followed the highs and lows of all local outfits and loved nothing better than travelling to watch Northern Ireland.Sincere condolences are expressed to his we Betty, daughters Jenner, Pamela and Heather, and extended family circle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Walking along path of history on the Camino pilgrimage  ","story":"THE faint sound of a church bell ringing in the distance, a cockerel crowing under a leafy olive grove at sunrise or the thunderous crash of an Atlantic wave as it beats off a rocky shoreline in northern Portugal became a welcome replacement to the bustle of Downpatrick last month.For  days, my friend Shona and I ventured the -mile trek of the Camino Portuguese from the beautul and vibrant city of Porto to Santiago de Compostela in neighbouring Galicia, in northern Spain.Time stood still as we listened to the rhythmic crunch of sandy gravel underfoot and breathed in the soft pine-scented woodland pathways that led to an ever increasing number of pilgrims making their way up through the captivating beauty of the Camino da Costa mdash just one of many routes leading to the famous cathedral which is the final resting place of St James the Apostle.Our journey began after a seriously hearty breakfast in one of the many fabulous street-side cafes in Porto on Thursday, May . The traditional merchant city is situated on the lsquoRiver of Goldrsquo. It was here in the th century that Portugal took its name. Much of its fine architecture in the old medieval quarter and a mandatory wine tasting session of the world famous ruby-port wine warrant atrip in itself some day.Hugging the coastline, this first stage meanders along a low lying shoreline of boardwalks and sand dunes to Vila do Conde where we took lodging for the night in a guest house as the townrsquos albergue offered only mattresses in a hallway.Day two saw us slowly begin to adapt to the rigours and demands of the Camino. I secretly longed for the day to be over before it began and was relieved that not just a few of us were wondering the same thing. Yet,  miles later, with a one and a half stone weight packed inside our rucksacks and the unwelcome emergence of a cluster of painful blisters forming, we were singing with joy as we arrived at the popular surfing resort of Esposende in the Braga district later that afternoon.Day three began in much the same way, neither of us forgetting the miracle cure that can be derived from a good nightrsquos sleep. We crossed the Rio Nieve to the first of two  foot peaks leading to Viana do Castelo where the majestic Monte Santa Luzia stands atop of a steep hill overlooking yet another captivating beachside town.Half way between Esposende and Viana do Castelo is Igreja Santiago de Castelo do Neiva, where an altar inion relating to St James and dated  AD was found during the reconstruction of the church. This is the oldest consecration to the apostle to be found outside Spain and has put this relatively recent route firmly on the official routes map for pilgrims.Onwards we hiked to Caminha on day four, where more beach board walks, pebbled pathways and sand dunes morphed into woodland trails, offering welcoming shade from the midday sun. Another steady uphill climb helped us reach here before crossing the Spanish-Portuguese border the next day.Farmers still tend their crops by hand in this part of the world, which harks back to a bygone era, leaving it untouched by modern intensive farming methods and giving us a window on the past.The fth leg of our journey began by being ferried across the border in a row boat which had a small motor installed, leaving behind the harbour town of Caminha for the Spanish town of Garda a few short miles round the bay.Further up the coast we trekked, for -and a-half miles until we reached the quaint seaside hamlet of Oia and its famous Cistercian monastery, Real Monasterio de Oia, which dates back to .By this stage our trek was getting easier as we adapted to the distances we were hiking each day. By way of a measuring stick as to how far wersquod come, we got chatting to a couple from Kent who had made their way to a villa they had rented out for a short break.They had driven from Porto in a hired car up the motorway the day before and it took them  minutes. It had taken us five gruelling, but extraordinarily peaceful days to reach the same point and we laughed at how easy it could have been.Each day we handed over our pilgrim passport to be stamped by church sacristans, post office workers, tourist office clerks, cafe and hostel owners, each of them eager to put their mark on our pilgrim way as we followed another hand-painted yellow arrow or scallop shell, dutully painted and maintained by locals proud to be part of a , year-old Christian pilgrimage, which has exploded in popularity in recent years not only with Christians, but also with the unbeliever, the doubter, the atheist and the sceptic mdash all eager to take on its challenges in a bid to escape the rigours and stress of modern day le.Each day too locals seemed to appear out of the midsts, asby magic, beckoning us with a whistle or a car horn to prompt us to turn aroundwe had mistakenly taken a wrong route mdash for which we were very grateful because each step we took seemed to matter a great deal.On day six the town of Moughas gave way to the mountain village Baiona, from where we walked to Ramallosa, famed for its historic sites and narrow medieval streets.Day seven presented a continuous series of spectacular vistas, each imprinted upon our minds until the day we die, such was their beauty, until we reached the large city of Vigo.Between Ramallosa and Vigo we met with a retired local man out walking his dog along the seashore. Silently he studied the two of us slouched exhausted over a park bench at mid morning. We could almost hear the mechanisms at play within his mind.ldquoWhere are you from  he enquired in a fair attempt at English.ldquoNorthern Ireland, we both replied, knowing that he was going to say something witty.ldquoAh, Paddies, he said, aswaiting our next move in a chess game.Ah, you must be Pedro, we retorted, intending no harm.ldquoWhere are you walking to  he enquired.ldquoSantiago de Compostela in Galacia, we both said.It was a trigger. After telling us quite succinctly what, over the last several decades, he had slowly come to realise le was about and how it should be lived, he asked: ldquoWhy are you doing it Neither of us was prepared for his directness but I showed him my rosary beads nonetheless. ldquoItrsquos a sacrice, I said straight out. He paused before he shook his head and said: ldquoYoursquoll never make it.As he watched us stand up he was only too eager though to hold our rucksacks as we reached into them again after our short but thought provoking rest.After wishing us buen Camino, he asked us to remember him when we reached the tomb of St James.Day eight and the noise and bustle of Vigo soon gave way to  feet and a steady climb of mountainous terrain and shady woodland trekking until we reached the refreshingly rural town of Redondela.Quiet country lanes led to  miles of more pebbled rustic pathways and stony gravel lanes on day nine until we reached the city of Pontevedra. As good fortune would have it, Friday, May , was a public holiday across Galacia and every shop, except cafes and wine bars were closed. We did mange to explore the magnicent Roman town though in the evening, but our bank balance didnrsquot suffer too much.Pontevedra paved the way on day ten with more forest trails and waterfalls. Our first climb of the day was to Caldas de Reis, home of the famous volcanic foot spa where for centuries pilgrims have been dipping their sore and weary feet in water of  degrees.Our penultimate day saw us take on the dizzy heights of Mount Corgullion before reaching the famous city of Padron, where we sampled the world famous padron peppers with dinner in the evening.Padron is  miles south of Santiago and is the starting point of St Jamesrsquos ministry in Spain and to where his remains were brought following his martyrdom in Jerusalem. His remains were later taken to the cathedral in Santiago where they lie in a tomb.We gazed in awe at the great Jacobean treasure and the original stone mooring post of Padron, from which the town gets its name.On the twelfth day a final temptation presented itself in the form of a train station that was situated directly opposite our lodgings that evening. Fellow pilgrims laughed at the idea that a train would take us to Santiago in  pain-free minutes,we werenrsquot up to the final trek and the almost , feet climb.I wasnrsquot laughing. I seriously eyed up the possibility, going as far to check train times. It was a stroke of good luck when I learned there was no other half way stop between Padron and Santiago. After what we had endured over the last  days, not to walk the final few miles would have been an obvious regret.And so we reached Santiago on foot shortly after pm on May , overjoyed and in a state of euphoria. The city of Santiago was worth the hike. Itrsquos as beautul and charming as it is captivating.The camaraderie and craic shared among all us pilgrims who made it from Porto to Santiago that day was incomparable to anything I have encountered before. The memories will stay with me until the day I die..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/entertainment/resources/images/9960568.jpg","title":"line up of calves win over judges at calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

There is nothing sacred anymore and no certainties. The DUP which once adhered to a strict moral code seem to have compromised their principles. Yet people continue to vote for them. Is this a case of the blind leading the blind To be fair we don’t have much of a choice because there is no credible unionist opposition. The UUP is just a pale imitation of the DUP.They are each in tow to what is loosely called “The Peace Process.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog To add to the confusion the Protestant churches are equally committedtruth is isive it is watered down or it has to go.Someone once said that “morally and spiritually the country is on a downward spiral and evangelicals are clapping their hands”. They are not reading the signs of the times -they were they would be raising their hands in despair.The nationalist community has no reason to be smug. They continue to vote for parties that have long since abandoned any pretence of promoting Christian values. In doing this they are making an even greater contribution to Ireland’s moral decline.All the parties affirm their commitment to peace but the presentation is so insincere and so inept. It’s a peace built on crumbling foundations at the expense of truth: “Don’t Offend” is the new mantra.We all know this and yet we continue to buy into it. No-one in their right mind wants toto “the troubles,” butwe sacrice truth to the  gods of peace I find that even more frightening. We need to be careful we are not selling our souls for it.Clive Maxwell, Ex-DUP member, BlearyJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":"....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]]]]]]]Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  People   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           People      :\"  Reported On This Day  Years Ago : Royal decree to ban double salaries for double jobbingFrom the News Letter of May   : People,     .Green and White Army daring to dream again after Estonia win#Good times never seemed so good# # as the lyrics of the Northern Ireland fans# anthem proudly proclaim # could not be more appropriate as the momentum under manager Michael O#Neill continues to build.People,  ..Michael OrsquoNeill and Stuart Dallas pay respects to road race legend Joey DunlopNorthern Ireland football fans and playing staff have paid tribute to one of the country#s greatest ever sports heroes while supporting the national team in Estonia at the weekend.People,  ..Belfast Pipe Band Championships: McNeillstown pushed hard to maintain perfect recordThe Civil Service Grounds at Stormont hosted the Belfast Pipe Band Championships on Saturday on what was a dull day with the light rain only coming for the closing stages.People,  ..:\" title\"The Belfast News Letter of May   :\" :\" Reported On This Day  Years Ago : Hopes that France can help end war against the TurksFrom theNews Letter of May   :People,  ..\" title\"The Belfast News Letter of May   \" \" Reported  Years Ago : Published here ndash works of poetry from an ingenious readerFrom the Belfast News Letter of May   :People,  ..\" title\"The front page of the Belfast News Letter of May   \" \" Reported  Years Ago : Violent man among two to die in Armagh jailFrom the Belfast News Letter of May   :People,  ..Police have a deflating experiencePolice got a little more than they bargained for after sharing a humorous post on Facebook about a slow puncture on one of their vehicles.People,  .. and his twin brother Cormac were best buddies.\" title\"Diarmuidand his twin brother Cormac were best buddies.\"  and his twin brother Cormac were best buddies.\" Memory of Lisburn twin killed in crash to live on through school memorialDiarmuid Frazer was just six years old when he was killed in a road accident in Lisburn in March .

The PSNI will not make such a decision in isolation.”Asked what advice police could give to motorists faced with long delays for an appointment, the PSNI said: “Keep checking the online booking portal for cancellations. Carry your appointment letter with you.”Charlene out to strike a gender balance in the music industry\"  \"  Reported On This Day : Murdering Irish peer is pardoned by King George II Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Cousens said: “If not quickly resolved, lawful drivers could be unfairly penalised for an issue outside of their control.“It’s not just the private motorist at risk either, as delivery vans are being caught up in the backlog. As the majority of freight is moved by road, inaction could dent the Northern Irish economy.“In previous periods of delay, Stormont has allowed exemptions to affected vehicles while the backlog is cleared. We hope that this can be repeated again while a long-term solution is sought.”Almost , more tests than normal were made in the first three months of this year.The Department of Infrastructure has said additional staff are being recruited and “urgent consideration” is being given to the possibility of opening testing centres on Sundays for a limited period of time in order to address the current backlog.try catch  TrendingMOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected driversIncreasing concern for N.I. teen who has vanishedSinger Malachi Cush lsquostablersquo in RVH following road collisionN.I.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential.

The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So can the Secretary of State explain what he has done to offset the lost opportunity for Welsh steel producers of the lost Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon and the electrication to Swansea \"What projects has he actually secured to provide procurement opportunities for Welsh steel producers  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

My own view on moving forward is that a final say Peoplersquos Vote on any Brexit deal is the best option.It was a really positive event, and thank you to all constituents who attended. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Glasson cow calved in February and is currently giving  litres of milk per day at .% butterfat and .% protein.“She is a tremendously well-bred animal,” Simon Haffey confirmed.“Our plan is to take embryos from her later in the year.”There was a tremendous turnout of dairy stock, across the board, at this year’s Armagh Show. The same could also be said for the number of visitors coming through the gates of Gosford Forest park, the now traditional venue of the event. Frequent heavy showers failed to dampen the enthusiasm and enjoyment of everyone taking part in what has now become a blue-ribbon event in the Co Armagh calendar. Meanwhile, in the beef cattle rings, the Matchett family, from the Birches in north Co Armagh, were having an equally successful day. Their two-year-old Charolais heer Summervilla Niki won the Beef Inter Breed Championship. She beat off the stf opposition posed by the majestic Limousin bull, shown by the Crawford family from Co Fermanagh.Niki was bred by Co Roscommon breeder Ciaran O’Donnell.“She is confirmed in calf to Allenford Vagabond,” Gail Matchett explained.“He is quite an old bull now but is an extremely easy calving sire. We currently have six pedigree Charolais females in the herd. We plan to grow this number for the future.” This year’s Armagh Show was also marked by the confirmation from the PSNI that rural crime has reduced signicantly across Northern Ireland. Inspector Kieran Quinn, who is based in Armagh city, attended the event. He said: “Rural crime figures have fallen by % over the past number of years.Police have a deflating experience Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“This is a very encouraging figure and reflects the efforts farmers are taking to prevent crimes from taking place in the first place.”He added: “There are  PSNI officers operating in the Banbridge, Armagh, and Craigavon areas. Our primary role is to advise farmers on how to prevent crime taking place in the first instance. The theft of a tractor, for example, is a major blow to any farming business.”try catch  TrendingTraffic warden told she will lsquoroast in hellrsquo during argument at Portadown open air church

All three of these sectors signalled a signicant decline in activity in April.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mannnn.jpg","title":"manufacturing is ni bucking the global slowdown","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Global manufacturing and industry stalwarts such as Germany are feeling the slowdown. So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
