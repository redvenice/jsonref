Although the evidence to suggest my blackouts were becoming problematic was very much there, I thought I didn’t fit society’s image of “alcoholic”, therefore failed to see how much damage my drinking and partying was doing to my life and my mental wellbeing.’Africa now runs an Instagram account dedicated to her sobriety, using hashtags like #sobrietyissexy, #soberaf and #recoveryrocks.She tells us about the process of going sober, how she’s learned to socialise without the booze and the stigma around being a woman of colour struggling with substance abuse:But Africa doesn’t only speak out about sobriety and health another of her projects, The Cherry Revolution, deals with sober sexuality.She says that when she was still drinking, she was having a lot of casual sex and ‘didn’t put any value onto sexual intimacy’.‘I abused sex in the same way as I abused alcohol. I numbed my body with sex I didn’t want.Think running the marathon\u0027s hard?

He is pictured a company after party in Beverly Hills, California on January 8, 2017Harvey Weinstein\u0027s laywers have called on the film studio he used to co-own with his brother to hand over a stash of his work emails, claiming they could help clear his name.In a filing with the US Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, an attorney acting for the disgraced movie mogul said the Weinstein Company has refused to allow him access to e-mails that were relevant to ongoing criminal and civil lawsuits.The 66-year-old was fired by the company after dozens of women including actresses Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek accused him of offences including sexual assault and rape. The film studio filed for bankruptcy in March amid the scandal.Weinstein is the target of federal and state criminal investigations in at least four different jurisdictions, including New York, Los Angeles, and London, which have requested documentation relating to their cases, according to the filing.He is also the subject of at least 11 civil suits, including one brought by British aspiring actress Kadian Noble. Weinstein denies all claims of non-consensual sex. According to his attorney, Scott D. Cousins: \u0027It is critical that Mr. Weinstein be granted access to e-mails relevant to the certain civil proceedings and criminal investigations and that are in the Debtors\u0027 possession, as they were sent or received by his TWC e-mail accounts.  The 66-year-old was fired by the company\u0027s board after dozens of women including actresses Angelina Jolie (left, in London on Feb 18) and Salma Hayek (right, in Beverly Hills on April 14) accused him of sexual offences \u0027The Debtors\u0027 continued refusal to permit Mr. Weinstein to access these emails has significantly impinged his ability to effectively defend himself from these allegations and is a continuing deprivation of his due-process rights.\u0027Weinstein\u0027s lawyers previously filed a suit asking a Delaware state court to force open up access to his work emails on October 8, but that attempt failed.Anthony Bourdain advises Alec Baldwin to \u0027just shut up\u0027...Italian \u0027Harvey Weinstein\u0027 is charged with three counts of...Doors from the Chelsea Hotel sell for $400,000 including the...Share this articleCousins blasted the Weinstein Company\u0027s board, which includes his brother, Bob, saying it was against their interests to deny him access to the emails as doing so exposes them to increased civil liability.\u0027To put it bluntly, TWC, and its counsel, may be knowingly withholding e-mails that may exonerate Mr. Weinstein and, importantly, that would aid in the efficient conclusion of multiple pending criminal investigations and civil litigations, thereby limiting significant potential liability to the Debtors and their estates,\u0027 he argued.          Weinstein is  the subject of at least 11 civil suits, including one brought by British aspiring actress Kadian Noble (pictured in New York on November 28The Weinstein Company itself has been sued by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman over claims it tolerated the \u0027systematic\u0027 sexual abuse of staffCousins said the Weinstein Company had already provided a \u0027handful\u0027 of emails which were already in the hands of investigators.He added that he was confident Weinstein would be able to obtain a \u0027favorable conclusion\u0027 to the cases against him if he is able to view the emails.The Weinstein Company was set up by Harvey Weinstein and his film producer brother Bob in 2005. It filed for bankruptcy after it spent months looking for a buyer or investor.Texas private equity firm Lantern Capital agreed to buy the company out of bankruptcy for $310 million, setting the floor for other bidders in a court-supervised auction scheduled for May 4.While the film studio has produced and distributed critically acclaimed movies as \u0027The King\u0027s Speech\u0027, as well as the televised fashion competition \u0027Project Runway,\u0027 the entertainment industry distanced itself from the studio after the accusations against Harvey Weinstein rocked Hollywood.The women who spoke out against Weinstein spurred a national movement against sexual harassment, with victims sharing their stories on social media and labeling them under the hashtag #MeToo. Dailymail.com has contacted Weinstein\u0027s representative for comment.            The Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy after it spent months looking for a buyer or investor.

Former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown described the MoS’s revelations as ‘horrifying’ and urged Google to pay users an annual fee for plundering their dataIt then uses the information to build an advertisement portfolio of its users’ interests.Businesses pay millions to Google to show their adverts to people whose data has indicated they may be interested in their products.While most realise adverts they receive are often based on their search history, few will be aware of the extent to which the company tracks their every online move.Experts have warned that Google’s huge cache of data may breach new data protection regulations which are due to be introduced next month.Web developer Dylan Curran, 24, requested all the information Google holds on him and was stunned by the results.He said: ‘I work in technology and had no idea Google was harvesting this amount of information.          Businesses pay millions to Google to show their adverts to people whose data has indicated they may be interested in their products‘What was particularly shocking was it had a record of websites I looked at while I was in Google’s private, incognito mode.‘It also had files I had deleted from Google’s cloud service, including an old CV, as well as every photo I had taken on my phone.‘It’s wrong to trust any entity that big with so much information. They’re just trying to make money, and at some point someone is going to make a mistake.’A Mail on Sunday reporter discovered Google had an exhaustive and precise record of his activities for every day since December 2014. The information included times and details of visits to restaurants, shops and bars – and the mode of transport used to get there.The reporter’s movements were tracked with a blue line to indicate each location visited. Google searches he had made at each location were also included.Another reporter’s visit to a cemetery in Macclesfield was archived after he searched on Google’s Maps app for directions to a funeral. It also saved his search for directions to a hospital in Dublin when he visited A\u0026ampE, and later recorded when he was discharged.Lord Ashdown said: ‘I am shocked and horrified that the personal intrusion into our lives is so deep – if this was a communist state we would not be tracked so closely.‘I’m pretty tech-savvy and was not aware of this – it’s unbelievable.

But not many people know that the amount of information Google collects about them is just enormous.          But data experts complain the terms and conditions are confusing and do not state for how long it will hold their data‘It would be entirely possible to provide great services while protecting people’s privacy. But instead, Google harvests and centralises years of information on billions of people around the globe to exploit it for profit.‘Should any company have that much power?

Why would something they searched for a decade ago still be relevant?‘Likewise, why does Google need to know your exact location on a certain date ten years ago?‘The new rules being introduced in May are more draconian than the current regulations and Google may be forced to delete all the data it is storing.‘Under the new rules, data can only be stored if a user made a “clear, affirmative and unambiguous” consented action to have their data harvested – ticking a box with tons of small print will not be enough. They will also be forced to inform users how long they will hold on to their data. At the moment they don’t do that, so they could be made to delete any information they have that was not ascertained under these new rules.’A Google spokesman said people should use its My Account facility to safeguard data.He said: ‘The privacy and security of our users is of the utmost importance, which is why we have spent years making available tools like My Account so people can understand and control their Google data and make the privacy choices that are right for them.‘We encourage everyone to review My Account regularly, and 3.8 million people did in the UK in the last year. \u0027Your data makes things like Google Maps work better and more effectively, by helping to do things like recognising traffic patterns and help you find the quickest way home.’And look what they know about just three hours of our man\u0027s life... four years ago          Looking at my data from December 23, 2014, I saw Google recorded that I left my street in South-East London at 11.31am and, tracking me via GPS, it knew that it took me seven minutes to walk to Lee station11:31 - They know what you want and exactly where you go Looking at my data from December 23, 2014, I saw Google recorded that I left my street in South-East London at 11.31am and, tracking me via GPS, it knew that it took me seven minutes to walk to Lee station.

Davina Katz, right, charges £500 per hour to clients, and represented Kate Winslet. Right is Annabel Scholey from the BBC show who thinks nothing of sleeping with her clientsShe was also involved in the staggering case of Kathleen Wyatt, who demanded £1.9 million from green energy tycoon Dale Vince despite his fortune being made a decade after they split.Thankfully Katz only shares her love of fashion with the character Nina, played by Annabel Scholey (right), who viewers will see thinks nothing of sleeping with her clients.Katz says: ‘I rarely act for clients with wealth below £50 million\u0027.  Devilish detail...  Meticulous planning by show bosses meant spending weeks shadowing real orce lawyers – and observing the extortionate fees they chargeProducer Lucy Dyke says the London firm Stewarts Law bills in six-minute increments.‘The timer starts from the moment the client enters the office.’Away from the clients, the lawyers are not so tidy. At one point producers counted ten pairs of £500 designer shoes shoved under the lawyers’ desks.‘The paralegals have trainers under theirs so they can run to court to file papers before a deadline,’ Lucy says.The design team also had personalised pencils and mints made for The Split after seeing them at every firm. ‘We had to put notices up for the crew saying “don’t eat the props”,’ Lucy says.The programme is even filmed in a real law firm – the former offices of Olswang in London’s Holborn (above) – while the court scenes were filmed at a disused court in Kingston, Surrey.  Battles that go down to the baubles and pet dog   Despite the fictional stories that form the basis of The Split, not much can compare with the drama of real life.Family lawyers have told The Mail on Sunday a series of salacious anecdotes which make the on-screen antics seem pedestrian. Often, it’s the orce lawyers who take the flak.Deborah Jeff, head of family law at Seddons, had her tyres slashed after a long day in court over a £5million orce case.          Stephen Tompkinson and Meera Syal (pictured) play a warring couple in BBC show The Split ‘I took it as a compliment because I’d done an outstanding job,’ Deborah says. Debbie Chism, partner at Stewarts Law, who recently acted for Prince Louis of Luxembourg, has had people shouting ‘It’s MY money’ in her face.‘One client’s other half sent the keys to a property in something a horse might have done,’ Debbie adds.‘I sent it to their lawyer’s office, saying “You can open this”. The keys came back sparkling.’A colleague of Emma Hatley, a partner at Stewarts Law and consultant on The Split, had to hire protection after a disgruntled spouse threatened him during a case.‘He actually attacked the judge outside the court,’ Emma says.Who gets what in a orce, including a collection of Christmas baubles and the family pet, is often battled until the last. ‘I had one case in which no one wanted the poor dog,’ Emma Hatley, a partner at Stewarts Law says. ‘It was really old. We had correspondence back and forth about it. The housekeeper took it in the end.’There was a case where a spouse sowed cress seeds into the Axminster carpet and then watered it, while another wife sawed the legs off the family’s Steinway piano because she didn’t want the husband to have it.A priceless wine collection is destroyed in The Split, a common occurrence, according to Sandra Davis – head of family law at Mishcon de Reya. In one of her cases, wine ‘ended up being poured down the toilet by the people who didn’t own it’.Sandra has also experienced a wrangle over a tea set. ‘The lawyer on the other side dropped one of the cups. That resolved the issue.’Pre-nups are also big business and can be more than illuminating for clients. During pre-nup talks, one of Deborah Jeff’s clients discovered her fiancé had a child that she didn’t know about but she still married him.Deborah adds: ‘I was acting for a retired Army major who was marrying a much, much younger lady. ‘When we declared there wouldn’t be the generous settlement she backed out of the marriage. He was devastated but did phone a couple of months later to say thank you.’  PS...Love CAN blossom  After years spent locked in court together discussing the most intimate parts of their private life, perhaps it’s not surprising.But producers on The Split were told that it wasn’t unusual for clients to fall in love with their lawyers and declare it even if it wasn’t reciprocated.Regardless of any romantic outcome, many friendships are forged from the lawyerclient bond.‘I’ve been to a few weddings but I tend to go to more decree absolute parties,’ says Deborah Jeff of Seddons. ‘I’ve been sent a few invitations to lavish ones in which you have to fly abroad to celebrate.‘Some people seem to have a bigger celebration than they did at the wedding.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/21/22/4B678E9F00000578-0-image-a-13_1524347831591.jpg","title":"Pippa Middleton 34 pregnant child","story":"    Pippa Middleton, the younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge, and her husband James Matthews are said to be expecting their first child          The couple are said to be \u0027overjoyed\u0027 while sister Kate \u0027could not have been more delighted\u0027  Pippa reportedly had a 12-week scan last week and have apparently revealed the news to family and friends          James Matthews and Pippa Middleton married in Surrey in May last year (pictured)      Steal Pippa\u0026#39s bridal style in a high neck wedding dressExplore the couture collection here...Whilst everyone this year may be speculaitng about what Meghan will wear on her big day in a month, this time last year it was all about Pippa!

Vets who feared huge St Bernard...Share this articleThe year-old dog went to live with them on the Isle of Arran, but escaped from their car in September.Since then, they have gone to ever more elaborate lengths to get him home. After basic searching and calling failed, they tried to lure with him treats such as sirloin steak and butcher’s sausages.They also tried enticing him with scent from a bitch in heat and even with unwashed clothes worn by his favourite member of staff from the rescue centre.The Campbells then adopted Drogo’s sister from Bosnia, to see if a family bond would bring him home.Meanwhile, Drogo has roamed the island, living wild, even through the harsh Scottish winter.Although he has evaded capture, the Campbells know he is alive and well. As well as sightings from across Arran he has been seen on a network of wildlife cameras installed by the family.Yesterday they pledged to keep trying to find their missing pet.          Paramedic Emma Campbell, 43, says that they have tried to tempt their pet back with sirloin steak and a bitch in heat but had no luckEmma Campbell, 43, said: ‘He’s a local celebrity. Everyone knows about this dog.’Paramedic Mrs Campbell and her husband Alan, 50, a roughcaster, have two children, Shaila, eight, and Gordon, five. The family, from Lamlash on the east coast of the island, rehomed Drogo as a replacement for their beloved dog, Bubba, who had died.When Drogo arrived, he was extremely nervous. Mr Campbell said: ‘He’s a lovely big dog. He never snarled, never bit anyone. But he was just so nervous.’ Mrs Campbell said: ‘I spoke to a specialist dog trainer, did research on how to settle him in, and stayed in touch with the rescuers in Bosnia. We got him toys, bowls, leads and a harness.’Four weeks later, Drogo bolted on his first proper walk.Mrs Campbell said: ‘He just panicked, knocked the lead out of my hand, and bolted. I did the wrong thing, and ran about trying to catch him. I now know you’re meant to crouch down and be quiet.          The dog is named after Game of Thrones character Khal Drogo, pictured, who is played by Jason Momoa‘We searched for hours. My friend put a post on Facebook and within hours the community rushed to help. \u0027We had 20 or 30 people out with dog treats looking for him in the first few weeks. But we were told he had gone into survival mode, wild mode, and he would just think everyone was a predator.’Drogo has been spotted across the island, which is 20 miles long and ten miles wide. Following expert advice, the family have moved traps and cameras to each new location.Mrs Campbell added: ‘It’s been crazy. After one sighting my friend Janis and I, and her dog, were sitting in Brodick graveyard for nearly an hour. We were going, “What the hell are we doing? We’re sitting in a graveyard with a bag of hot dogs”.’In September, missing dogs charity Harvey’s Army lent the family a cage trap. Baited with sardines, it was also fitted with cameras.In October, Julia Bate-Poxon, who runs the Bosnian shelter, sent a parcel. Mrs Campbell said: ‘Julia wore a couple of T-shirts constantly for three or four days. She sent them over with the scent on them.‘We put them in the traps, but a dog behaviourist said to also tie them in high places so the scent went further. By this time, Harvey’s Army had fundraised for six extra cameras. \u0027Every time there was a sighting we went out and set them up. It took hours. We did it constantly for months.’In December, the family even rehomed Goldie, Drogo’s sister, hoping that would lure their pet back.They know that Drogo has settled in the south of the island but now face a race against time – before lambing season begins in earnest."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/22/00/4B69874300000578-0-image-m-110_1524354970858.jpg","title":"Shock figures half graduates worst universities arent repaying loans","story":"    Bolton University vice-chancellor George Holmes, pictured, is on £220,000 a year, despite his university having the lowest number of graduated earning the loan repayment thresholdUK\u0027s biggest banks are pocketing £1BILLION a year by paying...Pippa Middleton, 34, \u0027expecting her first child\u0027 a year...Share this articleProf Holmes claimed starting salaries for Bolton students are lower because of reduced living costs in the town.He said: ‘Students do not hit the payback threshold as quickly but have a better standard of living with more disposable income.’Top of the league for well-paid jobs is the London School of Economics, where almost nine in ten graduates are earning above the threshold.

Instead of doing courses that are not going to get them graduate jobs, we should put a huge amount of money into degree apprenticeships, so that students earn while they learn and get a job at the end of it.’And Charlie Mullins, founder of the Pimlico Plumbers empire, suggested it was ‘fraud’ for universities to tell prospective students they need degrees to get well-paid jobs.A major report last year calculated that, in the long term, the Government will foot the bill for £5.9 billion a year in unpaid student loans."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/22/01/4B67D1CC00000578-0-image-a-23_1524358069946.jpg","title":"Cubas new President Miguel Diaz Canel meets Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro","story":"    Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel (left) and his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro (right) met on Saturday for Diaz-Canel\u0027s first official act as president           Maduro (left) was the first president to meet Diaz-Canel (right) since he became president Thursday.

I think she is doing the best she can in the public eye\u0027 she told the Sunday Mirror.\u0027I\u0027ve always really looked up to her, like a big sister I never had. She took me shopping for kids books and clothes.\u0027She taught me how important it was to read books. She\u0027s kind, genuine, very thoughtful and warm\u0027 she added.Ms Rasmussen also said she was \u0027embarrassed\u0027 by the way her mother and other relatives had treated Meghan since the news of the engagement broke.   Samantha Grant, who shares a father with half-sister Meghan, said the former Suits actress should have invited several family members \u0027out of respect\u0027.\u0027At issue is not a matter of closeness as more than 1,000 complete strangers are invited,\u0027 she tweeted. \u0027Family is family. I have an uncle I have only seen once by I would never say he is not family because we are not close. Humanitarians move forward with love and kindness especially to family.\u0027  Ms Grant, who uses a wheelchair after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, later changed her profile picture to a snap of her and Meghan together when they were younger.

And all of Harry\u0027s aunts and uncles – Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Princess Anne – will be there.Last night Michael, 78, who had a distinguished 19-year US government career, told The Mail on Sunday how he helped Meghan get a job at the American embassy in Argentina in 2001 when she was just 20 – a position she later boasted about in interviews.\u0027I knew the ambassador and I asked him if he could help, as her application was a little on the late side,\u0027 he said. \u0027That\u0027s why I don\u0027t understand why she has been so indifferent towards me. It\u0027s uncalled for. I helped her out and I didn\u0027t ask for anything in return.\u0027I\u0027m upset and surprised about not being selected but if they don\u0027t want me there, then I don\u0027t want to go.\u0027This whole invitation thing has not been played out very well. I never did anything to embarrass Meghan. It seems to me they handled the arrangements poorly.\u0027It was not well thought-out because no Markles I know are going to the wedding, although you\u0027d expect the bride\u0027s father to be there. I\u0027m disappointed, but I hope she has a good wedding.\u0027Michael\u0027s daughter Trish Gallop, 58, added: \u0027People usually invite their families to weddings, whether they are close or not. I would have loved to have given her my best wishes.

These couples said that after two decades they felt happier and spent more time together doing shared activitiesBut they failed to consider that their \u0027relationship trajectories\u0027 were completely different. Similarly to the sitcom effect literature on marriage also tends to take the stance that happiness levels decline after years of marriage. The researchers argued that an optimistic view of long-lasting marriages is not usually \u0027acknowledged or appreciated\u0027.  Amato and James, from Pennsylvania State and Brigham Young Universities, looked at 20 years of data which observed 2,034 married people.          Some couple\u0027s graphs were pointing in a negative direction from the start if they were heading for orce and showed signs of quarrels, hurt feelings, jealously and cheatingWhen the study, Changes in Spousal Relationships over the Marital Life Course, started a fifth had been married for less than five years, a fifth for more than 15 years and most from five to ten years.   Some couple\u0027s graphs were pointing in a negative direction from the start if they were heading for orce and showed signs of quarrels, hurt feelings, jealously and cheating.However those who were able to move past this stage developed a durability where they could move use their positive traits to settle arguments.This pattern continued despite a couples level of schooling however orce rates are lower for graduates.  The same can also be said for those in long-lasting second marriages with regards to levels of happiness. It was discovered in the study that wives tend to report less marital happiness than men who appear to benefit from marriage more.   Sir Paul Coleridge, chairman of the Marriage Foundation, said that the findings reflected marriages well as the feelings about marriage are often reflected by stereotypes.  He added that research continually finds that people want a rewarding monogamous and lifelong marriage, which according to this research is a reality. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/22/19/4B6FB88800000578-5644465-image-m-35_1524422317322.jpg","title":"London marathon runner proposes girlfriend finish line","story":"In the clip, Colin Harvey from Swindon jumps over the barrier before pulling out a ring from his pocket just seconds from the finish line of the London marathon          Mr Harvey, from Swindon, thought the London marathon would be the \u0027perfect opportunity\u0027 to propose as it would be \u0027full of emotion\u0027 anywayRunning on empty!

She was struggling with depression and I was walking on eggshells, trying to balance her ill health with my working lifeThe key word for me is \u0027love\u0027. I\u0027m a romantic. I want to give and receive true, heartfelt passion. But when I first fell in love, aged 18, I was struggling with a difficult home life: my mum, Sheree, was in a low phase and the fear that she would take her own life always haunted me.This was the early Seventies, and I\u0027d just started working as a pub DJ. People were into drinking and having fun, and when one thing led to another that frequently meant sex.I was doing what came naturally, shall we say, and discovered that I\u0027d fallen in love with two people at the same time — one called Caroline, and one named John.My big concern was that Mum might take it badly. I so wanted to open my heart to her. But she was struggling with depression and I was walking on eggshells, trying to balance her ill health with my working life.Dale Winton ‘died of a broken heart after being dumped by US...The Bond Girl mum who gave me my love of the limelight: DALE...Share this articleReally, she should have guessed long ago, what with my Dusty Springfield obsession. Boys at my school would be into the Stones or the Monkees, but all I cared about was Dusty.Put it this way, my favourite of all my mother\u0027s boyfriends, after she orced my dad, was a man called Aubrey who listened to Dusty singing Son Of A Preacher Man with me, and pronounced it \u0027a very strong song\u0027. That won my approval!The extraordinary thing is that, though I have met so many stars in my career, I only ever spoke once to Dusty. And that was by phone when I was a presenter at Radio Trent in Nottingham. I did see her once at a book signing, but I was too shy to go and say hello.Shortly after she died in 1999, I went to an exhibition of her memorabilia and a woman approached me to introduce herself as \u0027Barbara — Dusty\u0027s secretary\u0027. She told me a story that broke my heart.          My big concern was that Mum might take it badly. I so wanted to open my heart to her. Really, she should have guessed long ago, what with my Dusty Springfield obsessionA couple of years earlier, when Dusty was being driven around Soho by her chauffeur, she spotted me on the pavement and cried out: \u0027Oh look — there\u0027s Dale!\u0027At first, I was astonished at the very idea, then I realised I had mentioned her in just about every interview I had ever done. She probably knew what a huge fan I was.And here\u0027s the saddest part: her driver suggested stopping so she could get out to meet me and she said: \u0027No, I\u0027m too shy.\u0027 Isn\u0027t that awful? I was suddenly overcome with emotion at the thought, and collapsed on a chair, knocked off my feet by an incredible wave of grief.I was luckier with another musical heroine, the wonderful Cilla Black. We\u0027d been friends for years and she was a great fan of Supermarket Sweep — so much so that she invited me to come to push a shopping trolley on a Christmas edition of her top-rated show, Surprise Surprise.I wanted to repay the compliment, and when I was asked to stand in for Lorraine Kelly for a week on GMTV, Cilla was top of my guest wishlist. She couldn\u0027t make it because she and her husband Bobby were at their villa in Marbella. But when I told them I was due in Marbella for a TV shoot, they insisted I visit them.Sitting on their patio, chatting to Bobby while Cilla rustled up the most fantastic lunch, I couldn\u0027t have felt more at home. From that moment, we all became firm friends.After Bobby died in 1999, it would have been easy for her to fall to pieces but, heartbroken though she was, she said: \u0027I may have lost the love of my life, but I haven\u0027t lost my love of life.\u0027 That\u0027s so Cilla.Another of the grandes dames of showbusiness whose company I adore is Barbara Windsor. At her 60th birthday party I had a great time meeting almost the entire cast of EastEnders, before finding myself the centre of attention with some quite different East End characters.          Dale Winton is pictured leaving Scotts restaurant in London on July 26, 2016Tony Lambrianou, an infamous Sixties gangster who had served time for his part in a notorious murder, grabbed me and said in the gruffest of voices: \u0027Hello Dale, I\u0027m taking you to meet the guv\u0027nor.\u0027This was Freddie Foreman, a former associate of the Kray twins and the self-proclaimed \u0027godfather of British crime\u0027. \u0027Don\u0027t forget, Dale,\u0027 Mr Lambrianou growled, \u0027he\u0027s the guv\u0027nor. Show respect!\u0027I wasn\u0027t at all sure what to expect — but I have to speak as I find, and say the two of them could not have been more charming to me. Dusty, Cilla, Bar . . . I suppose I\u0027ve always been drawn to strong women, and that\u0027s my mother\u0027s legacy.My father was much less influential in my life, though I can\u0027t deny his death had an effect.He had always made it clear he felt little responsibility for me. When I was ten and my parents were orcing, he told me: \u0027Your mother will always look after you, Dale, so I\u0027m going to spend all my own money. I\u0027m leaving you nothing.\u0027He was true to his spiteful word — his will amounted to £284.Aged 13 and coming up to my bar mitzvah, the Jewish ceremony that marks a boy\u0027s transition to manhood, I was taken to Westminster Hospital to visit him.Though my mother had warned me he was not expected to live more than another day or two, she tried to keep his spirits up.\u0027You\u0027ll be fine,\u0027 she said to him, \u0027you\u0027re going to get better. You can come and recuperate at the house. We\u0027ll nurse you back to health.\u0027By now, Mum was living with another man (Aubrey, who shared my admiration for Dusty), but her kind words perked up Dad\u0027s morale. He began to make a miraculous recovery.          This was a time when gays were taken for all kinds of treatments, including electric shock aversion therapy, and it was pretty clear from Mum\u0027s words that if I was \u0027that way inclined\u0027, I could be straightened outMum was in a state of panic. \u0027My God, what are we going to do?\u0027 she exclaimed. \u0027I\u0027ve given him a reason to live and he\u0027s getting better by the minute. I\u0027ve made a promise to this man and he could be living with us within a week.\u0027More than that, he was planning to come to my bar mitzvah.I hadn\u0027t attended synagogue on a regular basis, and I was learning the Hebrew words of the ceremony phonetically, memorising the sounds without understanding their precise meaning. Dad would expect me to be word perfect. The big day was two weeks away, and it was all turning into a black farce.Then Dad had a relapse. Plans changed: he wasn\u0027t coming to the synagogue at all. Instead, I would do my bar mitzvah before the rabbi, with all my relatives watching, then take my tallis, capel and book to the hospital and read it to Dad.As I performed the ritual, speaking everything I had been taught, the congregation was in tears.It wasn\u0027t until afterwards that Mum took me to one side, kissed me, congratulated me and then put an arm around my shoulders. \u0027Dale,\u0027 she said, \u0027your father died this morning.\u0027She had to speak to the rabbi about Dad\u0027s funeral, and to deal with all the relatives. Aubrey the boyfriend took me to sit in his car.I asked him for a cigarette, and though I was only 13, he understood that I\u0027d been through enough. He let me sit in the passenger seat, blowing the smoke out of the window.I don\u0027t know what became of Aubrey. After a while, he just wasn\u0027t around any more. Maybe if he had still been there when I reached 18, I could have talked to Mum more easily about my love life. Because she really didn\u0027t want to know.I remember inviting her to look at a second-hand car at a garage on the Edgware Road. This was about 1972, the era of flared trousers and corduroy caps, and guys didn\u0027t have to be gay to carry a shoulder-bag.          I preferred to be ambiguous about my sexuality, but I\u0027m wise enough to realise that if you appear on the telly, there are certain things people think they have the right to knowFeeling very much the dedicated follower of fashion, I flounced into the garage with a bag swinging against my hip.I must have looked like a pastiche of Seventies camp, and Mum burst out laughing. \u0027Dale, if you could just see yourself,\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027re such a character. I wouldn\u0027t have you any other way.\u0027That wasn\u0027t really true. Soon after, I fell in love with John who was unmistakeably gay, and in the way of Seventies teens we used to natter for hours on the phone.One day, while we were chatting, Mum burst out of her bedroom in a rage. \u0027Are you talking to John again? You know he\u0027s gay, don\u0027t you? And if that doesn\u0027t bother you and you\u0027re hanging around with him, that probably means . . . you\u0027re going to be gay yourself!\u0027This tirade came out of the blue, and it got worse. \u0027I\u0027ve worked with gay people in the theatre and the movies,\u0027 Mum told me. \u0027They\u0027re great fun, but being gay makes for a very lonely old age.\u0027You don\u0027t have to be gay, Dale. There is an alternative. We can get help. This doesn\u0027t have to be the way for you.\u0027Shocked, I walked out . . . though I came back a week later.I\u0027ve never blamed Mum. It was the way most parents thought then. She wanted what she thought was best for me: marriage, a family — and grandchildren for herself.This was a time when gays were taken for all kinds of treatments, including electric shock aversion therapy, and it was pretty clear from Mum\u0027s words that if I was \u0027that way inclined\u0027, I could be straightened out. Perhaps that\u0027s part of the reason why, when journalists asked if I was \u0027one of those\u0027, I preferred to say nothing.I never forgot that afternoon. I was stunned and filled with guilt at having caused Mum such terrible distress when she was already depressed. I loved my mother with all my heart and I didn\u0027t want to disappoint or offend her. But I knew I could never be the person she wanted me to be.Until the day she died, I was never able to tell her: \u0027Mum, I\u0027m gay — and I honestly think that\u0027s OK.\u0027Adapted from My Story by Dale Winton (Arrow Books, £9.99).

Former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown described the MoS’s revelations as ‘horrifying’ and urged Google to pay users an annual fee for plundering their dataIt then uses the information to build an advertisement portfolio of its users’ interests.Businesses pay millions to Google to show their adverts to people whose data has indicated they may be interested in their products.While most realise adverts they receive are often based on their search history, few will be aware of the extent to which the company tracks their every online move.Experts have warned that Google’s huge cache of data may breach new data protection regulations which are due to be introduced next month.Web developer Dylan Curran, 24, requested all the information Google holds on him and was stunned by the results.He said: ‘I work in technology and had no idea Google was harvesting this amount of information.          Businesses pay millions to Google to show their adverts to people whose data has indicated they may be interested in their products‘What was particularly shocking was it had a record of websites I looked at while I was in Google’s private, incognito mode.‘It also had files I had deleted from Google’s cloud service, including an old CV, as well as every photo I had taken on my phone.‘It’s wrong to trust any entity that big with so much information. They’re just trying to make money, and at some point someone is going to make a mistake.’A Mail on Sunday reporter discovered Google had an exhaustive and precise record of his activities for every day since December 2014. The information included times and details of visits to restaurants, shops and bars – and the mode of transport used to get there.The reporter’s movements were tracked with a blue line to indicate each location visited. Google searches he had made at each location were also included.Another reporter’s visit to a cemetery in Macclesfield was archived after he searched on Google’s Maps app for directions to a funeral. It also saved his search for directions to a hospital in Dublin when he visited A\u0026ampE, and later recorded when he was discharged.Lord Ashdown said: ‘I am shocked and horrified that the personal intrusion into our lives is so deep – if this was a communist state we would not be tracked so closely.‘I’m pretty tech-savvy and was not aware of this – it’s unbelievable. This Mail on Sunday investigation has revealed, in an extremely powerful way, just how intrusive and personal this is.Facebook under fire for selling ads on pages of wildlife...Share this article‘At the moment it is a Wild West and we’ve let it happen because we benefit from Google and don’t mind it making a bit of money.

But not many people know that the amount of information Google collects about them is just enormous.          But data experts complain the terms and conditions are confusing and do not state for how long it will hold their data‘It would be entirely possible to provide great services while protecting people’s privacy. But instead, Google harvests and centralises years of information on billions of people around the globe to exploit it for profit.‘Should any company have that much power?

Ayesha Vardag, left, is nicknamed the \u0027Diva of Divorce\u0027 and could easily pass for Hannah Stern, portrayed by Nicola Walker in the BBC drama (right)Vardag, a mother-of-three, became a lawyer after her own orce and charges an eye-watering £845 per hour to represent everyone from a Qatari prince to the Marchioness of Northampton.In a landmark case, she won £64million for Pauline Chai in her orce from Laura Ashley chairman, Khoo Kay Peng.She says: ‘A separating couple will often genuinely race to get to me to represent them and not the other side.’The fab fashionista    Davina Katz (left), known in legal circles as the ‘soignée head of family law\u0027, dresses to impress– mostly in Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen.Charging £500 per hour, Katz, head of family law at Schillings, represented Kate Winslet in her orce from film director Sam Mendes and a number of European royals.

Right is Annabel Scholey from the BBC show who thinks nothing of sleeping with her clientsShe was also involved in the staggering case of Kathleen Wyatt, who demanded £1.9 million from green energy tycoon Dale Vince despite his fortune being made a decade after they split.Thankfully Katz only shares her love of fashion with the character Nina, played by Annabel Scholey (right), who viewers will see thinks nothing of sleeping with her clients.Katz says: ‘I rarely act for clients with wealth below £50 million\u0027.  Devilish detail...  Meticulous planning by show bosses meant spending weeks shadowing real orce lawyers – and observing the extortionate fees they chargeProducer Lucy Dyke says the London firm Stewarts Law bills in six-minute increments.‘The timer starts from the moment the client enters the office.’Away from the clients, the lawyers are not so tidy. At one point producers counted ten pairs of £500 designer shoes shoved under the lawyers’ desks.‘The paralegals have trainers under theirs so they can run to court to file papers before a deadline,’ Lucy says.The design team also had personalised pencils and mints made for The Split after seeing them at every firm. ‘We had to put notices up for the crew saying “don’t eat the props”,’ Lucy says.The programme is even filmed in a real law firm – the former offices of Olswang in London’s Holborn (above) – while the court scenes were filmed at a disused court in Kingston, Surrey.  Battles that go down to the baubles and pet dog   Despite the fictional stories that form the basis of The Split, not much can compare with the drama of real life.Family lawyers have told The Mail on Sunday a series of salacious anecdotes which make the on-screen antics seem pedestrian. Often, it’s the orce lawyers who take the flak.Deborah Jeff, head of family law at Seddons, had her tyres slashed after a long day in court over a £5million orce case.          Stephen Tompkinson and Meera Syal (pictured) play a warring couple in BBC show The Split ‘I took it as a compliment because I’d done an outstanding job,’ Deborah says. Debbie Chism, partner at Stewarts Law, who recently acted for Prince Louis of Luxembourg, has had people shouting ‘It’s MY money’ in her face.‘One client’s other half sent the keys to a property in something a horse might have done,’ Debbie adds.‘I sent it to their lawyer’s office, saying “You can open this”. The keys came back sparkling.’A colleague of Emma Hatley, a partner at Stewarts Law and consultant on The Split, had to hire protection after a disgruntled spouse threatened him during a case.‘He actually attacked the judge outside the court,’ Emma says.Who gets what in a orce, including a collection of Christmas baubles and the family pet, is often battled until the last. ‘I had one case in which no one wanted the poor dog,’ Emma Hatley, a partner at Stewarts Law says. ‘It was really old. We had correspondence back and forth about it. The housekeeper took it in the end.’There was a case where a spouse sowed cress seeds into the Axminster carpet and then watered it, while another wife sawed the legs off the family’s Steinway piano because she didn’t want the husband to have it.A priceless wine collection is destroyed in The Split, a common occurrence, according to Sandra Davis – head of family law at Mishcon de Reya. In one of her cases, wine ‘ended up being poured down the toilet by the people who didn’t own it’.Sandra has also experienced a wrangle over a tea set. ‘The lawyer on the other side dropped one of the cups. That resolved the issue.’Pre-nups are also big business and can be more than illuminating for clients. During pre-nup talks, one of Deborah Jeff’s clients discovered her fiancé had a child that she didn’t know about but she still married him.Deborah adds: ‘I was acting for a retired Army major who was marrying a much, much younger lady. ‘When we declared there wouldn’t be the generous settlement she backed out of the marriage. He was devastated but did phone a couple of months later to say thank you.’  PS...Love CAN blossom  After years spent locked in court together discussing the most intimate parts of their private life, perhaps it’s not surprising.But producers on The Split were told that it wasn’t unusual for clients to fall in love with their lawyers and declare it even if it wasn’t reciprocated.Regardless of any romantic outcome, many friendships are forged from the lawyerclient bond.‘I’ve been to a few weddings but I tend to go to more decree absolute parties,’ says Deborah Jeff of Seddons. ‘I’ve been sent a few invitations to lavish ones in which you have to fly abroad to celebrate.‘Some people seem to have a bigger celebration than they did at the wedding.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/22/01/4B6996B200000578-0-image-m-123_1524356383621.jpg","title":"George Michaels ex Fadi Fawaz handed 250 000 singers family spent Australia holiday","story":"    George Michael\u0027s family gave his lover Fadi Fawaz (pair pictured together) £250,000 to live on after the star\u0027s death despite his claims he was left brokeDale Winton ‘died of a broken heart after being dumped by US...Share this articleBut after taking to social media to slam Michael\u0027s inner circle, it has now emerged his family gave his former partner a substantial living allowance, reports the Sunday Mirror. Sources have told the paper Fawaz was far from penniless and spent some of his £250,000 allowance on visiting his family in Brisbane, Australia.A family insider told the Mirror: \u0027I feel that what has happened is so wrong to everyone.

And until now researchers have generally agreed that marriages start well but thereafter drift into terminal decline. Only it\u0027s a complete myth.\u0027However the researchers for this study realised that couples heading for orce had been lumped together as had those with surviving marriages.          These couples said that after two decades they felt happier and spent more time together doing shared activitiesBut they failed to consider that their \u0027relationship trajectories\u0027 were completely different. Similarly to the sitcom effect literature on marriage also tends to take the stance that happiness levels decline after years of marriage. The researchers argued that an optimistic view of long-lasting marriages is not usually \u0027acknowledged or appreciated\u0027.  Amato and James, from Pennsylvania State and Brigham Young Universities, looked at 20 years of data which observed 2,034 married people.          Some couple\u0027s graphs were pointing in a negative direction from the start if they were heading for orce and showed signs of quarrels, hurt feelings, jealously and cheatingWhen the study, Changes in Spousal Relationships over the Marital Life Course, started a fifth had been married for less than five years, a fifth for more than 15 years and most from five to ten years.   Some couple\u0027s graphs were pointing in a negative direction from the start if they were heading for orce and showed signs of quarrels, hurt feelings, jealously and cheating.However those who were able to move past this stage developed a durability where they could move use their positive traits to settle arguments.This pattern continued despite a couples level of schooling however orce rates are lower for graduates.  The same can also be said for those in long-lasting second marriages with regards to levels of happiness. It was discovered in the study that wives tend to report less marital happiness than men who appear to benefit from marriage more.   Sir Paul Coleridge, chairman of the Marriage Foundation, said that the findings reflected marriages well as the feelings about marriage are often reflected by stereotypes.  He added that research continually finds that people want a rewarding monogamous and lifelong marriage, which according to this research is a reality. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/22/19/4B6FB88800000578-5644465-image-m-35_1524422317322.jpg","title":"London marathon runner proposes girlfriend finish line","story":"In the clip, Colin Harvey from Swindon jumps over the barrier before pulling out a ring from his pocket just seconds from the finish line of the London marathon          Mr Harvey, from Swindon, thought the London marathon would be the \u0027perfect opportunity\u0027 to propose as it would be \u0027full of emotion\u0027 anywayRunning on empty!

Seventy artists – including several stars of the country’s emerging art scene – clubbed together and 168 pictures were sent to the UK for exhibition and sale.The pictures were duly shipped, but it took some high-level arm-twisting to persuade the Royal Academy to exhibit them. “It is amusing to read that the RA turned us down on the grounds that they didn’t like the pictures!” wrote one exasperated British Council staffer. “Neither do we: but that was not the point.”The show finally opened in November 1944, and went on to tour the country – though not without some eye-popping condescension, even from the critic who wrote the catalogue prologue. Sacheverell Sitwell drew parallels between Villa-Lobos, “who has written too much music”, and Diego Rivera, “who has over-painted”. He loftily concluded: “The progress of painting has been fast on this prolific soil, so fast that we may hope it will become slower and more serious.”So blinkered was the British art establishment about the potential value of any of the works that all but 25 of them left the country. Those that remained were doled out to 20 galleries around the UK, from Glasgow to Plymouth. They have had a sad afterlife, languishing unseen in storage – until this month, when a feat of sleuthing by an energetic Brazilian Embassy cultural attache has reunited all but one for an exhibition, The Art of Diplomacy, in London.This reminder of a time when Europeans had no idea what to make of Latin American art comes just as Brazil’s artists appear to be in higher demand internationally than ever. London alone will be showcasing three of them this summer, with Beatriz Milhazes at White Cube Bermondsey, Luiz Zerbini at the South London Gallery and Paulo Bruscky at the Richard Saltoun Gallery.Zerbini and Bruscky are making their UK solo debuts, as are the collective OPAVIVARÁ! who will invite visitors to sip herbal tea and swing in a giant rainbow hammock at Tate Liverpool. Meanwhile, Cinthia Marcelle – whose installation The Family in Disorder is at Modern Art Oxford – offsets OPAPIVARÁ!’s politics of community with a vision of order and chaos: humble building materials such as bricks, planks and paper are neatly stacked in one room and exploded in another, as if they were destroyed by riots or bulldozed by city planners.In the US, New York’s Whitney Museum recently staged a major touring retrospective of the neo-concretist Hélio Oiticica, while the city’s Museum of Modern Art has just opened a retrospective of Tarsila do Amaral, one of the 14 female artists who – unnoticed by Sitwell – contributed to the 1944 exhibition.So what’s so special about Brazilian art and why did it take the old world so long to recognise it? Tarsila, as she is affectionately called, was a member of the influential Grupo dos Cinco, a close-knit circle of five artists and writers who, as far back as the 1920s, had been making a case for a uniquely Brazilian modernism.“I feel myself ever more Brazilian,” she wrote to her family in 1923 from her base in France. “I want to be the painter of my country. Don’t think that this tendency is viewed negatively here. On the contrary. What they want is that each one brings the contribution of his own country … Paris has had enough of Parisian art.”The 1944 show came at a turning point for Brazilian art. The country was about to make a visionary investment in its cultural heritage, as RA curator Adrian Locke points out. Between 1947 and 1948 – when much of the world was exhausted by the second world war – Brazil opened three major galleries, one in Rio and two in São Paulo. In 1951, it took the audacious step of founding the world’s second biennale, which set out to rival Venice. Brâncuși, Picasso and Jackson Pollock were among the artists featured in the first two editions of the Bienal de São Paulo.The respect was slow to be reciprocated. Dawn Ades – who curated a landmark exhibition, Art in Latin America, at London’s Hayward in 1989 – tracks the turning point in the UK to two decades earlier, in 1969, when the Whitechapel featured an installation by Hélio Oiticica that has become a benchmark.Tropicália, a scaled-down version of which went on display at Tate Modern last autumn, aimed to evoke the higgledy-piggledy homes of Rio’s favelas, complete with tropical foliage and live parrots. “It was proto-performance art as well as this most wonderful construction,” says Ades. Oiticica, who died in 1980 at the age of 42, was “fascinating because, on one level, he was completely international, but he thought of himself as having Brazilian roots.” critic Adrian Searle noted as far back as 2007 that Tate Modern had been buying Oiticica’s work, revealing the increasing influence of a group that also included his friends and associates Lygia Clark and Lygia Pape. “Theirs was a modernism freed from northern, protestant restraint, and an art that strove to go beyond the gallery and the closed world of the market.” For Ades, the question of what makes Brazilian art so special is itself wrong-headed. She argues against the “irrelevant and dangerous tide of nationalism” that has pervaded the history of art for the last century, citing Cildo Meireles as another example of why its artists should be judged on an international level. His 2001 work Babel – a circular tower made of hundreds of old radios tuned to different stations – was also recently purchased for Tate Modern.On the coincidence of so many Brazilian solo shows in the UK, she says: “It might just be chance or it might be that there’s a very rich ferment going on in the country right now. There’s a real energy, but I certainly wouldn’t put them in a box that says Brazilian art. There’s a great exhibition to be done on the wave that goes from Brazil to Italy – arte povera – art that is on the edge of being an object in the real world.” The 24 pictures in The Art of Diplomacy might not all be world-class art but they contain forewarnings of this coming wave. The most powerful is a sinister oil painting in deep blues and browns of a small girl on a moonlit night, her head at an unnatural angle, as if she might be possessed by the toy she holds aloft on a stick. After the sale, which raised £1,000 for the RAF Benevolent Fund, The Scarecrow (The Half-Wit), by artist, ceramicist and poet Cândido Portinari, was donated to Harrogate’s Mercer gallery.A soft-porny landscape of bare-breasted women on a beach was the Tate’s only memento, gifted to the gallery by a Tory MP with more beneficence than taste. Even Cardoso Junior – the retired schoolteacher who painted the work, called They Amuse Themselves – might chuckle at the company he now keeps.• The Art of Diplomacy is at the Embassy of Brazil, London, until 22 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca391229d4ec13a1c2083cb52b17742afbc10bad/0_893_5680_3408/master/5680.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e2d0334f58717554377f1938956102d","title":"corita kent the pop art nun","story":"She shook up the church and the art world with her expressive, exuberant and boisterous workPop Art gave the world Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns in the US, and Richard Hamilton and Peter Blake in the UK, but one of its lesser-known stars was a nun called Corita Kent. During the late 1960s and early 70s, she used advertising slogans and song lyrics, as well as biblical verses and quotes from literature, to create vibrant silkscreens with trenchant political messages about racism, poverty and injustice.This year marks Kent’s centenary – she was born Frances Kent in November 1918 into a Catholic family in Iowa – and it’s being celebrated with an exhibition at Ditchling Museum of Art + Craft in East Sussex. What’s most striking is the juxtaposition of the monochrome nun – she wore the traditional habit complete with wimple and veil – and the brilliant colours which burst from her work.“Her art is expressive, exuberant, loud and boisterous,” says Ray Smith, director of the Corita Kent Center in Los Angeles. “But that contrasts with her own personality, because she wasn’t loud. She had a quiet intensity and was quite a private person.”Words sing out of Kent’s silkscreens, their simplicity often belying the complexity of their messages. In that they may have life (1964), she used images from a Wonder Bread wrapper to create a meditation on poverty and hunger, while in for eleanor (1964), she appropriated the US food giant General Mill’s slogan “The big G stands for goodness”, the source of which is a G for “God”.Threaded through her work is her life as a nun: she entered her order, the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, aged 18, trained as an art teacher and went on to head its college art department, leading to connections with leading artists, including the designer duo Charles and Ray Eames, film director Alfred Hitchcock and composer John Cage. But alongside acclaim from the art world came criticism from traditionalist Catholic churchmen – especially Cardinal James McIntyre, who took offence at works such as the juiciest tomato of all (1964), in which Kent likened the Virgin Mary to a luscious tomato.After the reforms of Vatican II, Kent and her fellow nuns decided to abandon their habits and do more community work McIntyre’s opposition to this led Kent to leave the order in 1968. She moved to Boston, living alone at the age of 50 for the first time. Her work between then and her death in 1986 is quieter and reflects a search for meaning from other religious traditions. It includes nature-inspired watercolours, as well as pieces that reflect her experience of cancer, such as live the moment light and out of the darkness (both 1977). But it’s her works from the 1960s that underline her relevance today. They trumpet her belief that social injustice can be changed and that at the heart of life it is love, and caring for others, that matter more than anything.Corita Kent: Get With The Action is at Ditchling Museum of Art + Craft, 5 May to 14 October (ditchlingmuseumartcraft.org.uk)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46969f6f0400caaabf4f2684c6b50914ac8dae8d/0_829_6884_4132/master/6884.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51f5c0aef75a10215fd018d8682757ca","title":"soviet film posters of the 50s and 60s in pictures","story":"After the break-up of the USSR in 1991, many artefacts associated with Soviet life – from posters to gadgets – were discarded, destined to be forgotten.

And funds received through corruption are often funds concealed outside the country, often in the financial sectors of major capitals. It is quite possible for countries to have ‘clean hands’ at home but ‘dirty hands’ abroad.“To truly fight corruption, therefore, we need to address the facilitation of corrupt practices by private actors. To do this, we will be encouraging our member countries to volunteer to have their legal and institutional frameworks assessed by the Fund – to see whether they criminalise and prosecute foreign bribery and have mechanisms to stop the laundering and concealment of dirty money.”Lagarde said the willingness of the G7 plus Austria and the Czech Republic to allow their anticorruption regimes to be tested was “a major vote of confidence in the new framework”.The investigation will form part of the annual Article IV health check that the IMF conducts on every member country. Philip Hammond said in Washington that the size of the City of London meant he could not definitively say that there was no illicit money flowing through the UK financial system but that the government was working hard to reduce and eliminate illicit flows.Lagarde said there was empirical evidence to show that high levels of corruption were linked to significantly lower growth, investment, foreign direct investment and tax revenues.A country that slid down from halfway to three-quarters of the way down a league table of corruption and governance was likely to see growth of national income per head decline by half a percentage point or more.“Our results also show that corruption and poor governance are associated with higher inequality and lower inclusive growth.”The IMF has had guidelines for dealing with corruption since 1997 but Lagarde said there was a need for an updated policy that aimed for a “more systematic, evenhanded, effective and candid engagement with member countries”.She added that the IMF was developing a clear and transparent methodology to assess how big a problem corruption was in inidual poor countries. This would involve looking at the quality of government departments in charge of tax and spending, and the integrity of central banks. The IMF would then look at the impact of any governance weaknesses on long-term growth.Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, said: “Corruption is a threat to prosperity, security and trust in institutions. It is a barrier to development. We need collective international action by governments, business and civil society to fight it. Unless we tackle corruption, we won’t make the gains in development which we need to. “The UK is working with international partners to end impunity for those engaged in corruption, to recover assets stolen from developing countries and to empower citizens to stand up to and report corruption.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78ecba60ac468891f90f60aa81c8f7675d3f0a51/0_256_4231_2540/master/4231.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae843e51b28159f08bf14a0d281d5448","title":"labour to seek local support for 250bn regional renaissance","story":"Party to court regional mayors and councils over transport and infrastructure spending plansLabour is to begin courting regional mayors and councils over its plans for £250bn of transport and infrastructure spending, promising to prioritise projects that boost productivity and help the rest of the country catch up with London.Speaking to the , Peter Dowd, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the party would open a series of consultations with local leaders over the coming months on its proposals to help close the regional ide.Dowd, the shadow chancellor John McDonnell’s number two a former leader of Sefton council in Merseyside, will have responsibility for allocating the funding. He said spending decisions would be made in consultation with local areas.Research from the Centre for Cities thinktank estimates that Britain’s economy would be more than £200bn bigger if all cities were as productive as the capital and the surrounding south-east region.Ahead of the first major test of the country’s political sentiment since the general election, when local voting opens across the country next month, Dowd said: “We need to make a monumental effort for the north of England to deal with years of under investment and spark a regional renaissance for our country.”Labour research shows government spending of almost £600 per person on transport in London to be almost 15 times that of Yorkshire and the Humber. The proportion of construction spending in the capital is more than the entire north of England combined.“There’s a terrible imbalance in infrastructure spending across the country,” Dowd said. “London and the south-east gets significantly more than north-west, south-west and north-east regions. There has to be equality of approach for the funding.”The government wants to close the productivity gap between London and other parts of the country through its industrial strategy, which includes a £31bn national productivity investment fund for infrastructure projects and research and development. The slow recovery in the growth of efficiency among British workers, a measure of economic output per hour of work, has been blamed for holding back wage rises and improving living conditions since the financial crisis.Dowd suggested, however, that austerity had acted as a drag on the recovery for parts of the country. “Some regions have been denuded of resource for years, but they’ve also been denuded of any sense of ability to influence government,” he said.

That’s what everyone – including members of the government – have been asking since the rumbling story erupted a week ago, after six months of cases appearing in the press. Trying to work it out herself, Amelia Gentleman, the  reporter who uncovered the scandal over six months, wrote rather modestly: “Obviously the prime minister is busy and maybe doesn’t read the  much.” But Theresa May employs people to keep her abreast of brewing rows, and no one thought to mention it.Stranger still, when you consider that this scandal has been years, not just months, in the making, as the “hostile environment” policy on immigration was formulated under the coalition. I understand that, at the time, it was the subject of a standup row in the cabinet room between May when she was home secretary and the then education secretary, Nicky Morgan. Morgan had, along with the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, raised concerns that May’s new policy for illegal immigrants would turn teachers and health workers into immigration officials. Morgan went further and also questioned the very principle behind the “hostile environment”. No wonder she lost her job as soon as May took over as prime minister.May had also been asking ministers from other departments to insert the phrase “hostile environment” into speeches and documents, which didn’t go down well. But while some Conservatives objected to the catchy name, few noticed that the design of the policy itself was flawed. It required people to produce documents that the Home Office itself knew no longer existed, or which it was highly unlikely that anyone, whether living here illegally or legally, would have kept for several decades.This wasn’t just May’s mess. David Cameron was the one who had made and then stuck to the Tory promise to drive net migration down into the tens of thousands. He then took over the cabinet committee charged with creating this hostile environment after his 2015 election win.Ministers from the time say they noticed Cameron growing rather awkward when dragged into standoffs between the Home Office and other departments over the target. “May would say to him, ‘Well, you’ve given me this target to meet so why are all these ministers getting in the way’,” says one cabinet minister. “That’s what she’s like, what she’s always been like, if you give her something to do, she’ll keep at it even when it seems impossible.”This dogged determination once won May plaudits as a “bloody difficult woman” who focused on getting things done, rather than playing political games. But it can also lead to the sort of stubbornness that prevents pragmatism: many Tories would dearly love for their party to ditch the net migration target, as it serves largely as a quarterly reminder that the government is still failing to meet it. Unfortunately, one of the very few who would die in a ditch for the target is May.Amber Rudd, her successor, is known to be more liberal on immigration in private. But she has stuck to May’s imprint for the Home Office, something her allies now feel is a mistake. “Successful home secretaries, like them or loathe them, set their own agenda,” says one. Some have suggested Rudd should have emulated Jeremy Hunt in pushing ahead with a personal programme of reform, though it’s difficult to see how this would have worked in practice, given May is still very interested in the Home Office and generally happy for Hunt to do as he pleases as health and social care secretary.These leadership tensions are one of the reasons Conservatives on both sides of the party think the Windrush issue suddenly blew up in the way it did: everyone saw it as an opportunity to further their own causes. Privately, many senior Tories aren’t too worried about the implications of the row itself, beyond the usual gripes about No 10 being “flat-footed” in not realising there was a problem, and refusing to discuss the matter with those who tried to raise it. They think this is eminently solvable, and it will cause no long-term damage to the Conservatives – so long as the Home Office ensures the flaws in the hostile environment policy are ironed out quickly.This, though, suggests few Tories have yet grasped how big the flaws are with the hostile environment approach, despite the many years in which it has now\u0026nbspbeen active. It has caused problems that go far beyond the Windrush generation.

Even Syria, torn by a seven-year civil war, has signed the pact.Bloomberg, whose net worth Forbes pegs at about $50bn, was speaking on Earth Day, to CBS’s Face the Nation. He did not commit to provide funds beyond 2018 and said he hoped that by next year Trump would have changed his mind.“America made a commitment and as an American, if the government’s not going to do it, we all have responsibility,” he said. “I’m able to do it. So, yes, I’m going to send them a cheque for the monies that America had promised to the organization as though they got it from the federal government.”Trump, he said, should be able to “listen to others and change his mind. A person that doesn’t change their mind isn’t very smart … And he’s been known to change his mind. “He should change his mind and say look there really is a problem here. America is part of the problem. America is a big part of the solution and we should go in and help the world stop a potential disaster.”Asked if he thought the non-binding nature of the Paris deal was a problem, in terms of other countries not sticking to its aims for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the effect of climate change, Bloomberg said: “Look, it’s dangerous to keep doing what we’re doing. “If everybody would do the right thing, yes, it would be better. But if some people or some countries do the right thing we all benefit from that.“All I know is that America, I believe, will meet its commitment by 2025 to reduce greenhouse gases by an agreed amount, and if we do it hopefully other countries will do it as well.”Asked if he was “filling a leadership gap”, the media baron – who was a Republican mayor and considered a 2016 presidential run as an independent – said: “Well, I think that this is what the American public when you poll them say they want to do.” The odds on him running for the White House in future, he said, were “not very high”.Bloomberg said the Trump appointee, who has expressed doubt about accepted climate science, was “saying the environment doesn’t need protection” and saying instead he would “try to protect jobs”. “That’s not his job,” Bloomberg said. “His policies are not good for the world. That to debunk science and walk away from it is just ridiculous. Even if you don’t believe it. If there’s a possibility that it’s right, you have to take prophylactic actions to prevent a disaster.”Firing Pruitt would be up to Trump, Bloomberg said, adding: “If he could get Scott Pruitt to change his policies, then he can keep him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c4c911393d1135f25adb297b65eb1c505a7c41c/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0198ad103fb16f12ae85851724c0b88","title":"blue blooms matisse is having a fashion moment this spring","story":"Sixty-four years after his death, the French artist is this season’s style inspirationIn Dior’s spring 2018 campaign, a model poses on a floor marked with flowing black line drawings of idealised faces. You can’t mistake the origin of these designs – Henri Matisse. Of course, these sketches are not actually by Matisse, any more than JW Anderson’s Moon Face earrings or Victoria Beckham’s Fluid shirt (which sold out quickly upon their autumn release) were designed by the man who painted the blazingly carnal Dance in 1910. In fact, Dior’s collection was inspired by the artist Niki de Saint Phalle, with references to her brightly coloured sculptures and mirror mosaics featuring heavily throughout. The overall takeaway from the brand’s SS18 advertising campaign, however, was pure Matisse. Because, 64 years after he died, the French artist is having a fashion moment.No modern artist has been as unapologetically sensual as Matisse. It is hard to know where to begin when drawing parallels between his purified abstract art of pleasure and the aesthetic boldness of modern fashion because there are so many threads in the weave. To start with the most obvious, though: colour. The Dior clothes mingling with those Matisse-like drawings include nocturnal blues that might be seen by a er looking up through moonlit waters. In another example of the Matisse wave, the blue and pearl ovals of Annie Costello Brown’s Skye Earrings resemble the night sky. All these aqua hues echo one of the most intense masterpieces of poetic colour that Matisse ever painted, his 1913 canvas The Blue Window.The depths of colour into which Matisse can e are, in fact, related to his own interest in fashion and fabrics. Born in 1869 in Picardy, northern France, where traditions of powerfully coloured textile weaving go back to the middle ages, he collected brightly coloured rugs and hangings all his life, especially from north Africa, and used them to create a private world of utopian rapture in his studio. You see the magic colours of these textiles, especially in his 20s paintings of models in rich interiors, which also show his eye for fashion: in Odalisque With Red Culottes (1921) he has his bare-breasted model show off a pair of opulent baggy pants.Matisse enjoyed fashion, so why shouldn’t fashion enjoy Matisse? Yet the current vogue is not so much about copying his culottes as putting on his masks. All these moon-faced earrings and floor drawings of haughtily gorgeous people are directly descended from the way Matisse reinvented the human face when he painted a portrait of his wife, Amélie, in 1913.It was the time when modern artists were looking at African masks in Paris’s Musée d’Ethnographie du Trocadero and enthusiastically collecting them. Picasso saw savagery and terror in these masks. Matisse saw cool beauty. In his portrait of Mme Matisse he gives her a mask-like face with mysterious black eyes, carving her features into a regular, symmetrical ovoid shape – a moon face, even. That mask-like perfecting of the human face was to become an obsession in his art that culminated in a superbly pure oval gazer among the dreamy coloured cut-outs he created in his last years.He drew faces with a relaxed freedom that is itself part of the new Matisse mood. Why not fill space with lines that mean something, as Matisse did in his idyllic drawings and cut-outs? At the Oscars, veteran film-maker James Ivory sported a shirt with the face of Timothée Chalamet, star of his film Call Me By Your Name, portrayed on it, with Matisse-like sensuality, by the British artist Andrew Mania.That same romanticism wafts through all the hints and echoes of Matisse that are drifting gracefully through the fashion world.For Matisse is not some cold decorative artist. He is a hot, passionate one, forever chasing a beauty so extreme it could shatter reality and replace it with a dream. Surely fashion is another way of chasing that dream. Those Matisse earrings and that Matisse shirt are fragments of the utopia his art creates, in which body and soul become one. Or if that’s too heady, let’s just say that by imagining the human face as a godlike mask, Matisse created a truly democratic ideal of beauty – democratic because it’s heavenly. No one actually looks like the moon. At least not on the outside. In channelling this great artist, fashion is ing deeper than it is sometimes given credit for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7a1094f8ac97ba3071efdd42b846028f1c53c63/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0414eb7cbea613682b03cb9405e03a9","title":"obey review jamie jones london riots","story":"Jamie Jones’s shrewd drama describes some of the tensions, rage and desperation felt by young people of colour before violence spilled on to the streets in 2011• Sign up for Film Today and get our film team’s highlights of the dayThis movie, from first-time feature director Jamie Jones, takes place amid the London riots of 2011 and the white noise of rage and desperation they both caused and fed off, as the police shooting of Mark Duggan in Tottenham triggered angry protests that degenerated into nationwide violence and looting.As the title implies, the film is about power. It is about submitting to the imperatives of sex, friendship and family, and asks what it was like to live in that atmosphere, to inhale its microbes of anger and fear, and to contend with the decibel count of aggression on the streets. One of the film’s most insightful moments comes when the three main characters go on a bucolic narrowboat ride along the River Lea the sudden calm and silence are startling and healing. It is the noisy and clamorous city that is poisoning people’s hearts.Obey is a well-directed, well-acted film that cleverly meshes news footage of the riots with staged fictional scenes, and there is a strong central performance from Marcus Rutherford as Leon, a young man just out of care, back at home with his caring but lonely and alcoholic single mum, Chelsea (an excellent performance from T’Nia Miller) and channelling his energies into boxing. When social tensions escalate, Leon finds himself in a crisis of loyalty among his friends, while falling for a beautiful social justice warriortrustafarian white girl, Twiggy (Sophie Kennedy Clark), who is temporarily in a squat, though with the safety net of a comfortable family home out in the shires.My reservations about the film centre on its tendency towards gender cliches and to fetishise the dangerous blondeness and sexiness of its female lead and also the way it ends on a macho flourish of violence that has no consequences other than the final credit roll. The violence has kept it real – end of story. Yet what leads up to all this is powerfully and emotionally presented.Leon is a thoughtful, intelligent guy dealing with complex emotions. The film reveals that his going into care at 15 was a voluntary decision, and his return home four years later is conditional on his mother dealing with her drinking issues now his abusive father is off the scene. But his mother has a new boyfriend, who is another bully and addiction enabler. Leon hangs out with his friends, who drift around getting into trouble almost accidentally. James has a very interesting opening shot, showing them all ambling up the street talking about all sorts of lightheartedly outrageous stuff before stealing something from a car seemingly on a whim.Sucking up nitrous oxide from balloons is their chief leisure activity, and there is a nice moment when Leon morosely plays with some Scalextric in his flat – a reminder of fleeting childhood happiness. Fate turns when he goes to a squat party and meets the elegant Twiggy, who has an activist boyfriend, Anton (Sam Gittins), clearly from the same side of the tracks as her. Leon finds himself drawn shyly into their ambit, to the suspicion of his friends. His feelings for Twiggy are one source of tension, his loathing of his mum’s obnoxious boyfriend is another, and then, when the riots cause the boxing gym to close its doors, the frustration climbs to dangerous levels.The disorder causes a serious split among his friends, some of whom believe the riots are about “revenge” and some whom think it is about “stealing stuff”. When Twiggy shows up at Leon’s flat, her encounter with his mum is uneasy. “Where d’you spring from?” asks Chelsea. “Same place as you, I guess,” says Twiggy insouciantly, to which Chelsea replies: “We ain’t from the same place, darling.” And they certainly aren’t.Jones gets some nice shots and shrewd moments. I was intrigued when he showed two police officers in an alley, one getting the other to drink some water – they are just as scared as everyone else. A robust, confident debut."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce75d12bd9da67172fb8618498cecde6050ab677/0_143_5253_3152/master/5253.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db8feaeedb1f951507da302b24b690d0","title":"outdoor cinema britain boom","story":"Britain is in the middle of a boom in outdoor cinema, as people brave the unpredictable British climate to watch films “on location” in castles, aircraft hangars and even beach huts.George Wood, founder of Britain’s biggest outdoor film company, the Luna Cinema, says ticket sales have tripled in the past three years. “You strike gold when you can actually pair the film to the venue,” said Wood.Luna has shown Gladiator in the grounds of a medieval castle, Jaws at an outdoor swimming pool and Top Gun under the wings of RAF fighter aircraft. “It adds a whole other dimension to a film you might have seen 15 times before,” Wood says.Luna now plans to take giant 10 metre-wide screens to nearly 70 venues across Britain, three times the number visited five years ago. They will be erected in places ranging from Brighton beach to the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh.A former actor, Wood set up his company a decade ago, initially as a hobby to tide him through the summer when acting jobs were scarce.“I’d been to Australia and seen an open-air screen out there and thought: what a brilliant idea. I remember saying to my Aussie mates, why don’t we do this in England? And they all said, at the same time, ‘because your weather’s shit, mate’!”Undeterred, Wood hired a small screen and showed Some Like it Hot at Dulwich Park in south London. To everyone’s surprise – not least the council that gave him the permit – 500 people turned up to watch Tony Curtis woo Marilyn Monroe.Wood, who only days before had broken his leg in a moped accident, says he was hobbling around on crutches and thinking, “My God, this is it, this is what I’m going to do.”He says: “People thought that open-air cinema would be a fad, just one of those London things that wouldn’t transfer elsewhere. Actually, it’s the provinces that have been the real success story. It turns out that people in Lincoln love Top Gun as much as anyone in London.”David Cox, programmer for the Film4 summer screen season at Somerset House in central London, insists outdoor cinema is much more than just singalongs and crowd-pleasers.His “dreams”-themed summer programme includes David Lynch’s Blue Velvet and Christopher Nolan’s Inception, but such is the demand for the outdoor “live cinema experience”, as he calls it, that he expects to fill the 2,000-capacity courtyard every night.And it is not just Hollywood films on offer. Thanks to new hi-tech LED screens that work under direct sunlight, events such as Wimbledon, the football World Cup and the royal wedding will also be streamed live and alfresco.The phenomenon has also opened up the lucrative children’s market, with a series of daytime family programming planned for this year, featuring films such as Paddington 2 and Coco.Richard Cope, a trends expert at Mintel, thinks the booming popularity of outdoor cinema is because people are hankering for “old-fashioned communal viewing experiences”. He says: “It’s the American drive-in concept but done in a modern guise. People are so used to consuming media on their phones and iPads, there’s a natural craving for this kind of decompressed experience – where there’s loads of space, where you can react together, where you’re not just watching something on your own and tweeting about it.”Cope believes outdoor cinema works well for musicals and “scary” films, where groups of friends can chat and drink while watching. But the constant hum can be a “massive distraction” for arthouse movies, such as Blade Runner.“If you think about it,” says Cox, “it’s quite a vulnerable situation to be in. You don’t know what the weather’s going to do, there are no armrests to separate you from whoever you’re sitting next to, so people are putting their trust in each other – I think that makes them even more susceptible to watching a film and feeling it in a deeper way.“And then there is the beauty of being outside on a summer’s night. It’s a very different experience from what people might expect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3e139f72ebc36d3f4eb7a07b140a323de9d4df5/0_8_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51b4481a0d719be9c782efb559d624ab","title":"verne troyer austin powers mini me cult star dignity and good humour","story":"Troyer, who has died aged 49, famously incarnated Mike Myers’ clone Mini-Me in Austin Powers, and was at the forefront of pop culture’s modern challenge to bigotry“I shall call him … Mini-Me!” This was how Verne Troyer was brought on to the screen, and into the world of cult stardom: a world which was part cruel, part affectionate. It was in the 1999 movie Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. Mike Myers’s Dr Evil has just been cloned, and does a convulsive double-take on realising that his double is one-eighth his size. Two-foot-eight Troyer comes on in the Bond-villain quasi-Nehru jacket and impassively does the signature little finger to the lips move – worryingly like a precocious infant. An almost-star was born, although Troyer had begun his screen career in 1994 in the movie Baby’s Day Out when he had been the stunt double for a baby. Troyer repeated the Mini-Me role in the Austin Powers sequel Goldmember, had a small part as a goblin in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone – and with dignity and good humour sustained a career in reality television and the professional celebrity industry for almost 20 years.This career ned a period in which people of restricted height – Troyer had achondroplasia dwarfism – were starting to be regarded differently in cinema and in pop culture. People with dwarfism had always been treated exploitatively, and cinema from its earliest days adopted the robust circus tradition of using them brashly, unsentimentally, and expected them to behave in the same matter-of-fact way. And for many that was at least better than condescending pity. Tales of the Munchkin actors’ drunken behaviour on the set of The Wizard of Oz became legendary.Kenny Baker found his weird vocation in playing R2D2 in Star Wars. Felix Silla was an Italian circus clown who had work in comedies and scary movies (an habitual generic combination for actors with dwarfism). Zelda Rubinstein made an impression in Chevy Chase’s 1980 comedy Under the Rainbow, a 30s-period comedy, set at the time of the filming of The Wizard of Oz. British actor David Rappaport had a very similar career, but was given a chance to shine more than usual in Terry Gilliam’s Time Bandits (1981). But it was Peter Dinklage, Game of Thrones star, who has really escaped the patronising prejudice in a very contemporary way. He has stated that “dwarfs are still the butt of jokes. It’s one of the last bastions of acceptable prejudice.” It was a bigotry that his career has repudiated, although Troyer arguably couldn’t match Dinklage’s acting talent.In a way, Warwick Davis’s career is closer to Troyer’s: he acted in the first Star Wars prequel Phantom Menace and, ironically, replaced him in the Harry Potter franchise, but it was archly playing himself in Ricky Gervais’s TV comedy Extras that made Davis’ name. Davis challenged bigotry with confidence and black comedy, breaking the hush of liberal concern, and that was the same cheerful self-awareness that Troyer tapped into. There is an ongoing debate about the whole idea of “mini-me”: the idea that performers with dwarfism are just being demeaningly represented as comic or horrific miniatures. But Troyer at any rate tackled and subverted that idea — with confidence, with comic gusto and with charm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d76d89edc88d7c902e5961f751cc848478c067e/678_209_2318_1391/master/2318.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02f6057a1a7f0a1aad5ede7a729ae8c9","title":"verne troyer life in pictures","story":"Verne Troyer, who at 2ft 8in was one of the world’s shortest men, racked up 30 film credits in a career ning 24 years"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dbbc395b8ea3ef00a886c256f19694b6dd89860/0_109_3649_2189/master/3649.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b290e0a22c85a0d82368aacf2c0e717","title":"chelsea southampton fa cup semi final match report","story":"Antonio Conte would not admit it after the match, but Chelsea’s progress to a second successive FA\u0026nbspCup final has been restorative. The Italian has worn a haggard expression on the touchline in recent weeks as his side’s pursuit of the top four was rendered ever more forlorn, his demeanour indicative of a campaign consumed by anticlimax. But the old zest and manic enthusiasm were back in plain sight at Wembley. Chelsea eased beyond Southampton to ensure a season that has served to underwhelm could yet yield major silverware.The prospect of another spiky collision with José Mourinho, and Manchester United, in the domestic season finale will merely add to the sense of occasion. “There is not a problem between him and me,” offered Conte rather unconvincingly of a counterpart with whom he has sparred regularly during his time in England, with relations having reached a nadir this year.“We are talking about two managers with strong characters and two winners,” he said. “And when in your mind, in your heart and in your blood there is the will to win … I have great respect for United’s story, for Mourinho’s story, and they have the same respect, I think, for Chelsea’s story and my story. But we want to win.”The Italian’s career at Stamford Bridge is winding down prematurely, his departure anticipated in the summer but he can still go out with a bang. This was a semi-final claimed by his two strikers, Olivier Giroud supplying a goal of jaw-dropping quality in the opening exchange of the second half before the substitute Álvaro Morata added a late second, even if it was Eden Hazard’s effervescence which had most consistently illuminated the occasion.The Belgian seemed to thrive playing in a competition that can still be won. Southampton, with Premier League survival their priority and four critical games still to be played, were aggrieved to have been denied a route back into the fray by the officials in the game’s frenetic latter stages. Yet in truth they rarely contained the irrepressible Hazard and had been badly unpicked by Giroud’s close control.The Frenchman had scored twice against these opponents in the league just eight days previously but neither of those goals could match his opener on this grander stage. Cesc Fàbregas’s lofted pass forward 25 seconds into the second half had been optimistic but Hazard collected on the volley in mid-air ahead of Jan Bednarek and, once grounded, kept his head to flick the loose ball towards the penalty spot, where Giroud had evaded Mario Lemina in anticipation of a pass. The composure demonstrated thereafter by the Frenchman, in the tightest of spaces with markers flinging themselves in from all around, was startling.A touch with his left foot took the ball away from Maya Yoshida, a second with his right cutting back to bypass Cédric Soares as he slid in. The slalom was played out at pace and, by the time the striker had calmly flicked home his finish with the outside of his right foot as he finally stumbled, Alex McCarthy and Bednarek had joined Soares in the pile of bodies cluttering up the goalmouth. “My second passion has always been skiing,” said the Frenchman, born in Alpine Chambéry whose first professional club was Grenoble, through a smile. Giroud’s control and subtlety of touch had been too much for Southampton. He has won all 10 of his club visits to Wembley, a record to which Chelsea will cling next month.Mark Hughes’s side, who boast a solitary top-flight win since late November and languish four points below the relegation cut-off, had already survived Willian striking the crossbar by then with their initial display cramped by caution, but they did at least respond to their deficit. Shane Long’s dreadful first touch, after Wesley Hoedt’s diagonal pass and Charlie Austin’s dummy, passed up a fine chance to equalise. The introduction of Nathan Redmond and Dusan Tadic injected “craft”, according to Hughes, though luck remained elusive.Willy Caballero, initially wrong-footed, had done wonderfully well to improvise a save and deflect Redmond’s shot from distance behind with his left arm as he fell. Yet the goalkeeper was far less convincing from the resultant corner, leaping to catch a high ball under pressure from Austin only to spill back, behind and over his line. His blushes were spared by the referee blowing for what seemed a soft foul. “The keeper’s basically thrown the ball into the back of his net, and if ever there was a situation for the VAR to step in, that was an opportunity,” Hughes said. “It was a match-defining moment. Why it wasn’t referred, I have no idea.”He also bemoaned the non-award of a penalty after the ball struck Giroud’s arm and saw Austin skim a shot on to the far post before the end. Yet by then Chelsea’s lead had been doubled. Morata had been on the pitch only a few minutes when César Azpilicueta gathered in space and flung over the kind of cross from which successive Chelsea forwards have prospered in recent times. His compatriot had eased far too comfortably away from Hoedt and his downward header bounced beyond the helpless McCarthy.“In this type of game, the most important thing is to reach your target,” Conte said. “To reach another final is very important for the players, important for the club, and especially it is important for the fans. I’m delighted for them.”It may not be enough to prolong his stay into a third season but Conte can still emerge from a trying campaign with a trophy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7e06b40b89bbf1b795ba23f671994e05939f214/0_78_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64489d9dd77d70682fd2eaddf9f96d20","title":"eusebio di francesco roma liverpool champions league","story":"Roma’s voluble manager Eusebio Di Francesco is full of passion as his side prepare to face Liverpool in the Champions LeagueWords race out of Eusebio Di\u0026nbspFrancesco’s mouth like cars entering il\u0026nbspGra, the orbital motorway that encircles the city of Rome. They are going a mile a minute, bumper to bumper, yet the man behind the wheel somehow finds a way to transmit an overwhelming sense of calm.Roma’s manager speaks fast because this is no time to drop a gear following his team’s return to their Trigoria training base after a vital league win away at Spal. They have barely one day here before they pack up again and fly to Liverpool for the first leg of their Champions League semi-final.Roma began this weekend third, just a point clear of Internazionale in fifth. The game against Liverpool will be their eighth in 25 days, a stretch that has included not only a two-legged quarter-final with Barcelona but also a draining derby against a Lazio side fighting to leapfrog them in the table.If this team is running close to empty, you would not know it from the grins on players’ faces as they arrive for training. “What we do is a job but it needs to be fun, too,” says Di\u0026nbspFrancesco. “It should be a joy. That’s what I always say to the lads. The first thought is to prepare to enjoy ourselves together, and work hard. They have to enjoy themselves. This is a game first of all.”That lesson was learned during Di\u0026nbspFrancesco’s own playing career. As a member of the Roma team that won the Scudetto in 2001 – only the third in their club’s history – what he remembers above all is the way that he and his team-mates used to spend time together off the pitch, hanging out to play cards or shoot\u0026nbsppool.He does not see great similarities between that team and this one. “Because these are completely different times. There’s a greater professionalism now, as there should be, but back then there was more of a family spirit. That’s been lost a little bit, with social media, with technology, with the arrival of new ways of working. If those two things could come together, that would be the ideal. And we are trying here to make it so.”That he thinks a great deal about players’ psychology is obvious. After Roma overturned a three-goal deficit in the second leg of their quarter-final against Barcelona, pundits rushed to acclaim his tactical nous, switching for the first time to a three-man defence: some move for a man who has always insisted that 4-3-3 is the “ideal formation”.Yet Di Francesco frames the change differently. “Football is dynamic,” he asserts. “Even when you talk about a four-man defence, you often end up defending as a three, or even a two, depending on the game situation.“My decision to change the system was linked to the fact that with some teams, with the characteristics of certain players, a three-man defence can give you a little bit of extra physicality. You get a little bit of extra strength – some of that just in the heads of the players themselves. Sometimes, especially in Europe, you need a little bit more physicality.”That was certainly the case against Barcelona, bullied into submission by Roma’s muscular midfield trio of Radja Nainggolan, Kevin Strootman and Daniele De Rossi. Does Di Francesco plan to repeat the ruse against Liverpool? He would hardly tell us if he did, yet he does observe that Jürgen Klopp’s team are a long way from the old English stereotype of long balls and reducers.Appointed last summer, Di\u0026nbspFrancesco never had a chance to work with Mohamed Salah. If there is any regret at missing out on the chance to coach such a talent, then he hides it well, though he does note his players’ praise for “a great guy, a great professional, a hard worker”.“I don’t need them to tell me,” he says with a smile when asked if he has sought out advice from his defenders on how best to frustrate Salah. “His qualities are very clear. Don’t forget that I prepared games against him in Italy, too. But the fact lots of our players know him well, that can be an advantage.”Salah has scored 41 goals this season, yet it was his assists last year at Roma that helped Edin Dzeko to reach 39. The Bosnian has a more modest 20 this time around, and Di\u0026nbspFrancesco offers frankly that “he has alternated good matches with not-so-good ones”. The good, though, have been very good indeed. He notched a double at Stamford Bridge and scored in both legs against Barcelona.Does Di\u0026nbspFrancesco think Manchester City made a mistake in letting go of a player so capable of taking the biggest games in hand? “It seems to me Guardiola loves a different type of forward. One who’s a little more mobile, a little faster. Edin is a fantastic player, but with different physical and technical attributes to the ones Guardiola wants.”He is banging the table now, swept away with the force of his own sentiment. Italy’s biggest clubs first came calling for him in the summer of 2016, yet he turned them down then because he could not stand to walk away from Sassuolo in a year when he had just led them to their first ever Europa League qualification.Di Francesco believes in seeing a project through to its conclusion. For Roma, he hopes, a first Champions League semi-final in 34 years is just the beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5b0c91e4991ee59e4aee22ec45f8673b749acb8/0_99_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=209940dfdd8bdd8df4c0022cbb12b14d","title":"juventus napoli serie a match report koulibaly","story":"Napoli threw the Serie A title race open in dramatic style on Sunday when Kalidou Koulibaly scored with a towering header in the last minute to give them a 1-0 win at the leaders, Juventus.Maurizio Sarri’s side cut the gap between them and the Turin side to one point with four matches to play, setting up a dramatic finale to the Serie A season. Juventus, chasing a seventh successive title, still face difficult matches away to Internazionale and Roma. Napoli dominated the match but seemed to have run out of ideas and energy until the final minute when José Callejón’s outswinging corner was met by the Senegal international with a mighty header which left Gianluigi Buffon helpless.Napoli will hope to capitalise on any slip-up by their modern rivals when they tackle the likes of Torino, Sampdoria and Crotone across their remaining fixtures.Juve needed steel in defence to nullify Napoli’s forward line but a key figure was removed from the back three early on when Giorgio Chiellini suffered an injury during a clash with Lorenzo Insigne.Stephan Lichtsteiner replaced him and despite the disappointment of the enforced change to the game plan, Juve came close to scoring with a little over a quarter of an hour on the clock in Turin.Bosnian schemer Miralem Pjanic rattled the far post with a free-kick after Raul Albiol had fouled Gonzalo Higuaín and the touchpaper had been lit.Napoli soon found channels to run into given the modified Juve set-up and in the 21st minute Mario Rui let loose a twisting drive that Gianluigi Buffon did well to palm over the crossbar.Another Azzurri raid down the left allowed Mario Rui to set up his captain Marek Hamsik, who grimaced after dragging his shot across Buffon’s goalmouth and wide of the far post.Napoli had the ball in the back of the net as half-time approached, Insigne prodding home only for referee Gianluca Rocchi to rule that the Italy striker had been offside.Allegri surprised many when he withdrew Paulo Dybala for Juan Cuadrado at the break, not only removing the X-factor of the Argentinian from the pitch but leaving himself with just one more substitute.And with Napoli making up consistent ground in the Juve half as the second period progress, the boss rolled the dice and threw Mario Mandzukic into the fray when there were 20 minutes remaining.Pjanic made it his business to try and pick out the tall Croatian with his pinpoint free-kicks - one in particular caused chaos in the Napoli box.But the visitors were unruffled and roamed forward to test Buffon with a sighter from Piotr Zielinski. Juve failed to heed the warning and in the 89th minute the unthinkable happened."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e5293d881847d2a5dc9e3605ac3afd4ba0efa63/0_137_4104_2462/master/4104.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0caec2d958e17cfda65b3e4aaa3192a9","title":"manchester city swansea city premier league match report","story":"Manchester City fans came to see a victorious coronation and were not disappointed. They witnessed a masterclass from their freshly crowned champions on a jubilant afternoon.It was decorated by a 20-yard peach from Kevin De\u0026nbspBruyne that rocketed past Lukasz Fabianski after 54 minutes on a right-left diagonal that was as pure a connection as possible. This had Pep Guardiola blowing his cheeks in admiration and the Etihad Stadium offering a collective “ooh”.This 29th victory takes Guardiola’s team to 90 points, six from breaking Chelsea’s record Premier League total of 95. If the maximum remaining are taken, City will finish on 102. They also have 98 goals, six short of breaking the highest tally of 103, again by Chelsea.At the close City supporters invaded the pitch and at least one flare was fired. Each of these could draw a Football Association charge but Guardiola, understandably, was not concerned.“No problem,” he said. “Football is an emotional game. I understand you have to be careful – but when they feel they want to share that they are happy – it is better they stay where they should stay – I’m not going to tell them don’t do that.”Of his team, whose 1,015 attempted passes was the most since 2003-04, breaking records, Guardiola said: “Looking for them helps to keep the players focused.”For his stated mission of ending the season with five victories Guardiola made two changes. Kyle Walker and Leroy Sané became substitutes – alongside Benjamin Mendy after seven months out with a knee injury – as Danilo and Bernardo Silva took their places in a still formidable XI.Carlos Carvalhal made one alteration – Luciano Narsingh being replaced by Mike van der Hoorn, as the manager continued Swansea City’s survival bid. His team formed a pre-game guard of honour before a newly unveiled banner that read: “Welcome to the home of the Premier League champions”.Guardiola’s men began and ended as they nearly always do at home: in control. Fabianski’s first action was to catch a long De Bruyne cross-shot from the right that was heading in.Next Ilkay Gündogan played an inadvertent one-two with the referee, Craig Pawson, that allowed the German to find David Silva. He relayed the ball to his namesake Bernardo and a devilish delivery was scrambled out for a corner by Martin Olsson.De Bruyne took this but it was unproductive. The Belgian’s next contribution was the opposite. This time, from along the left, he found Raheem Sterling who turned the ball off his left foot inside to David Silva. It ricocheted off Van der Hoorn and the Spaniard collected a 10th of the campaign.After the quarter-hour the lead was doubled. Once more David Silva was involved. He returned a pass to Fabian Delph and, when the ball was swept in, Raheem Sterling had a tap-in for his 23rd goal of the season.This signalled contest over with more than three-quarters still to play. Already the game was akin to a training ground affair with the home side yo-yoing the ball around. De Bruyne – City’s player of the season – warmed Fabianski’s fingers with a left-foot zinger. Gabriel Jesus hit a low shot that again kept the goalkeeper honest. At the close of the half Alfie Mawson wandered forward and took aim at Ederson. The Brazilian collected but this was as good as the visitors were before the break.The second half began with a lightning foray that included a David Silva step-over and ended with Danilo’s cross flashing before Fabianksi.After De Bruyne’s glorious finish City continued to dominate. Sterling won a penalty, Jesus’s effort from the spot was steered on to the post via a Fabianski palm, and Bernardo Silva slotted in the rebound.It might have been more but Alfie Mawson’s back-header rebounded to safety off the left post. There was even time for a 15-minute cameo from Mendy and for City to secure a fifth as Yaya Touré’s lob was headed home by Jesus: it was that kind of day for City.Carvalhal’s side are four points above the drop zone with four matches left. Asked how the defeat would affect confidence, the manager said: “Zero, absolutely. They are a team from another planet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce1be2e6d4ef0d46ecc8a5433b5622694923d6d0/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=113daca5227bde980b338478c70db7bf","title":"juventus v napoli serie a live","story":"Kalidou Koulibaly’s immense last-minute header gave Napoli a famous victory and moved them to within a point of the champions Juventus That’s it for tonight’s coverage. We’ll have a match report on the website shortly, and Paolo Bandini’s usual piece tomorrow. Thanks for your company, goodnight.Here’s the updated Serie A table. It’s still in Juventus’s hands, but two of their last four games are away to Inter and Roma.Napoli’s players are celebrating like they’ve won the biggest game of their life. Which is exactly what most of them have done. Many of their fans are in tears of joy. It was a game that promised much and delivered very little - until that unforgettable late twist. Calcio? Bloody hell.Napoli move to within one point of Juventus with a famous victory at the Allianz Stadium. It looked like Juventus had broken their spirit with a defensive masterclass, only for the superb Kalidou Koulibaly to win the match with a mighty header in the final minute.90+1 min There will be three minutes of added time. Koulibaly has been brilliant all night and that was a monstrous header.Callejon hit an outswinging corner from the right towards the penalty spot, where Koulibaly got the run on Benatia before leaping to thump an immense downward header past Buffon! What a header!Napoli have scored in the last minute!!89 min Insigne’s inswinging cross beats everyone at the near post and is palmed away by Buffon, ing to his left. That would have sneaked in the corner.86 min Napoli look shattered. For the first time in the match they are struggling to keep the ball, and Juventus are happy to play out the last few minutes.83 min Zielinski’s wobbling long-range strike is pushed away by Buffon, who decides to take no chances. Napoli have increasingly been restricted to shooting from distance.82 min A moronic foul by Callejon on Pjanic gives Juventus a free-kick 40 yards from goal. The title is getting away from Napoli, who look frustrated and tired. Pjanic’s free-kick clears everyone and goes a few yards wide of the far post.81 min Milik eyes the top corner from 30 yards. Goalkick to Juventus. Napoli look like they have had their optimism slowly broken by the Juventus defence.80 min Napoli make their final substitution: Allan off, Marco Rog on.77 min Insigne leads a Napoli break and plays the ball into Milik. He tries to slide a return pass through to Insigne and it’s intercepted by Benatia. Fine defending yet again. It’s been a masterclass from Juventus.75 min This match sometimes feels like the same bit of footage on loop, with Napoli probing patiently before eventually running into the brick wall that is Juventus’s defence.73 min Callejon’s superb volley is excellently saved by Buffon, though it wouldn’t have counted as he’d been wrongly flagged offside.71 min Juventus make their last change, with Mandzukic replacing Douglas Costa. The match is apparently drifting towards a 0-0 draw that would make Juventus strong favourites for the title.68 min Insigne, picked out nicely by Mario Rui, pings a long-range shot that is comfortably patted down by Buffon.68 min Napoli are running out of time. At the moment it’s stalemate.63 min Juventus are defending so well. Napoli are struggling to create anything of note despite having all of the ball.62 min “Evening Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “Thrilling and tense Sunday night Serie A title deciding MBMs are all well and good, but they’re not exactly World Championship snooker on the red button, are they?”Remember when the ‘red button’ was as exotic, mysterious and exciting as, er, Friends Reunited?60 min Napoli’s first change: Milik replaces Mertens.59 min The second half is following the same pattern as the first - lots of neat possession from Napoli matched by formidable defending from Juventus.57 min Douglas Costa zips past Hysaj in the box, but Jorginho comes round to make a vital interception.55 min Hamsik’s deep, curling cross clears Asamoah and is volleyed over on the run by Callejon. It was a tricky chance.54 min Cuadrado’s shot is blocked by Koulibaly, who is having a fine game.52 min Nice play from Napoli. Insigne plays a good short pass down the inside-left channel to Hamsik, who whistles a first-time shot into the side netting at the near post. Buffon had it covered.49 min A slow start to the second half. Napoli have some good options on the bench, notably Arkadiusz Milik we’ll surely see him if it stays like this.46 min Peep peep! Juventus begin the second half.Juventus have made a half-time change, with Juan Cuadrado replacing Paulo Dybala.Here’s the Serie A table as things stand. Napoli wouldn’t be out of it - Juventus still have to go to Inter and Roma - but realistically they probably need to win tonight.That was a fascinating 45 minutes, even if there weren’t many clear chances. Pjanic’s deflected free-kick hit the post for Juventus Insigne and Hamsik put decent opportunities wide for Napoli. See you in 10 minutes for the second half.43 min Napoli are playing some lovely, eye-catching football. But if I was a Napoli fan, I would fear this happening in the second half.40 min Napoli have played like the home side for most of the half, though Juventus won’t really mind that. The problem for both sides - Napoli with lots of possession, Juve on the counter - has been a lack of penetration.38 min Insigne has a goal disallowed for offside! It was the right decision, though it was also a lovely first-time finish.33 min Napoli continue to play the slicker football, though they have yet to really test Buffon. It’s a fascinating match."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a04a1a573a13f82df117ceb4dc3c788f197665e/0_913_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d8500d148f1577affe8752de22d049a","title":"amy schumer interview film i feel pretty marriage love stand up","story":"Outrageously rude and shockingly funny, Amy Schumer has always made her audiences gasp. She talks to  Sophie Heawood about falling in love, one-night stands and going nuts on stageWhen I meet Amy Schumer, she has been married for exactly one month and is working on a joke about her husband’s penis. Something along the lines of, my husband is uncircumcised – for now. She had jotted it down on the Notes app on her iPhone, where she keeps a lot of ideas, but it duplicated the note five times “so now it looks like I really have plans to mutilate him,” she says.She then admits that she actually first used that line about another man she used to date, “but you have to update it so it’s about the person you’re with now. And really, my husband is good, he can keep everything he has. At this point in my life, I’m cool with foreskin or not – God bless everyone and their penii,” she says, breezily, as if she might have exhausted herself by creating a persona who is supposed to care so much.Amy Schumer is a conundrum. A native New Yorker, she made her incredibly successful name doing stand-up comedy about raw, rude sex and all of its discontents, about dating and dirtiness and blacking out drunk and doing the walk of shame home. Her TV sketch show, Inside Amy Schumer, ran for four series on Comedy Central and often mercilessly skewered the gender hypocrisy of what our culture allows men and women to do, in particular the beauty myths that silently surround women, in sketches such as “Girl You Don’t Need Makeup” and “Her Last Fuckable Day”.At the Glamour awards in London in 2015, after various female celebrities had tottered up to the stage to receive awards in heels they could barely walk in and dresses they could barely breathe in, Schumer strode on. “I’m probably 160lb right now,” she said, looking out over the audience with disdain, “and I can catch a dick whenever I want. That’s the truth.” I was there she changed the mood of the room from faux modesty to explosive, spluttering laughter, and all the disdained women ran up to her afterwards, desperate to be her friend. It felt like a tipping point in that industry famous women have been letting their guard down ever since.Yet a couple of months later, her debut movie Trainwreck came out, which she wrote and starred in. It began promisingly and originally, but ended with her character giving up her competitive career and literally becoming a cheerleader – an actual cheerleader – for her clever, high-achieving man. The next year Schumer published her autobiography, The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo, in which, alongside stories of a childhood going from riches to rags on Long Island with her dad’s dodgy business skills and then illness, and both her parents’ philandering, she wrote that, actually, she had only ever had a one-night stand once, and it was lovely and respectful, thank you very much.Now she has made I Feel Pretty, a film about a woman who gets a bash on the head and wrongly believes herself to have become as beautiful as a supermodel, and so creates a whole new life for her sexy self. The film asks if beauty is a state of mind – while also involving Schumeresque motifs such as a vaginal injury on an exercise bike.Meanwhile, Schumer has surprised the gossip papers by suddenly getting married, to a chef called Chris Fischer, in a lacy white wedding dress on a clifftop in Malibu. For celebrities, this is as traditional as your father walking you down the aisle in your village church. Coverage of the wedding made it all sound rather giddy and impulsive, but when I ask her about it, she is anything but.“I feel exactly the same as before I was married – but I’m psyched. I love him,” she says, her face deadly serious, like she’s been through a thing or two in this life. “Like, I’m fucking – it feels like having a partner. It feels like not being alone.” We are sitting in a rather fancy hotel suite overlooking Central Park, where Schumer is promoting her new movie. Her bodyguard is in the next room, along with two assistants who have taken Schumer’s tiny black poodle Tatiana, who was barking too much for the interview. “He’s 38, I’m 36, so, you know, we are not completing each other. We already are who we are and just want to support and encourage each other. And so I’m psyched that I don’t have to be zipping up my knee boots, leaving someone’s apartment at 3am. I’m done.” She says this wasn’t like other relationships, “where you’re like, come on, pleeease meet my parents. I can’t believe I dealt with any of that bullshit before! This was like, oh my God I fucking love this person, and I admire him, and we’re a team and he was ready.”I ask her if it is hard, having created such a bold sexual persona, ever to find the space to feel shy, but she looks baffled by that question and says that she isn’t ever shy. In fact, she looks baffled by quite a few of my questions: interviews are clearly not her favourite thing. I want to discuss her work being about the concept of fuckability, but she says that that’s not accurate, and turns her nose up a bit.She says this film is about her character Renee simply wanting to be seen, and though there’s a boyfriend angle, “I don’t think of this movie as a love story. It’s about her and her friends.” She says the dressing-up is for other women, because she has learned, with age, that we don’t really dress for men. “In my experience, men are not that psyched and the guys that I’m attracted to aren’t the guys who are like, ‘Oh, is that the new Givenchy line?’ I think, her thing is about confidence and about feeling attractive.”Well, yes and no. I mean if it’s all about women, then her character entering a bikini competition and shaking her stuff all over the stage in a e bar full of men does seem an interesting move. Yet the thing about the bikini scene is – it becomes lovely. You start watching it behind your hands, cringing – and by the end you’re charmed by the sight of someone just thoroughly, unabashedly enjoying herself.Schumer is glad I liked that scene, and says she fought for it. She was supposed to just stand there, “but I said no, I’m going to go nuts on stage, I’m going to dump water on myself, do the whole thing. And I seriously fought everybody and I’m so glad I did.” She also has a sex scene, and fought to be allowed to reveal more flesh but still have the film rated 13. “I think we should see more, you know, and I’m not letting them retouch any of me in the movie.”There is an idiosyncratic, pioneering power to Schumer’s comedy work that I keep looking for in her films. They veer towards slapstick whereas her solo material has brains and guts. I do not make myself popular by suggesting this, and Schumer bristles when I ask what sort of movies she would make if there was no financial compulsion for feelgood endings.“You know, I said no to a movie where I would have made five times this amount of money,” she says. Really? Someone else’s project? “Mmm,” she replies, mysteriously. “For me, it’s not so much about the money. Like, I wouldn’t want to spend three years of my life working on The Revenant. I filmed a drama two years ago and it was a bummer. I don’t want to show people what I can do – I just want to do stuff that will make people feel better.”Hot women, once the butt of her jokes, now get cast in her films. I Feel Pretty co-stars Emily Ratajkowski, who rose to fame dancing topless in the Blurred Lines music video, and also features a cameo from Naomi Campbell. “I did a lot of press yesterday sitting next to Emily and I think that probably would have been kind of hard for me 10 years ago,” she admits. They were wearing similar clothes, “and I would have made a joke about it before – but now it’s just – I just feel like that’s over. I kind of feel done with the self-ranking thing.”She says this comes from growing up and realising that she feels most beautiful when she’s away with her girls, or on a night out where she’s just “so happy, so comfortable, you know who you are. And then it’s like, well, why can’t we just feel like that all the time?” One of those girls is her best buddy Jennifer Lawrence. “I texted her yesterday and I was like, ‘I did an interview today and I told them you were really hideous up close.’ And she wrote, ‘Actual LOL’, and then she added in parenthesis ‘(Because I’m so pretty, you know?)’ And I was like, ‘Exactly.’” I ask about their shared sense of humour. “Well, Jen’s quick. She picks up on things that I just mutter to make myself laugh. I’ll just say something under my breath, and she’ll be like, ‘I heard that.’”Speaking of comic actors, Michelle Williams is an absolute revelation in I Feel Pretty. It’s perhaps the biggest shock of the film. “Me too,” says Schumer. “I didn’t know she was really funny. Like she’s really funny. Why didn’t we know? It’s because they always put her in some awful thing where she’s got to be on the floor, crying.”As for the #MeToo movement, Schumer wholly supports it but isn’t jumping up and down whooping about it “because, while it’s exciting, it’s also really triggering and upsetting. It makes everybody feel super vulnerable. But to think that this generation is going to say, ‘This isn’t acceptable,’ and not just bury the things that our mothers buried – that feels really good. It feels like, across the board, we’re getting closer to equality. Which is – it’s such a gut-wrenching thing to even have to say that.”She must have seen a few of her own male colleagues in comedy go down. “Right, there are people you love that can have really shitty behaviour that needs to be called out. And then there are so many men who are just scared, they’re just waiting for the phone to ring, they’re waiting to open their computer and see their faces and it’s a frightening time for them. But then we’re going, ‘We’ve been frightened our whole lives.’”As for the future, Schumer continues to campaign for gun control, aided by her distant cousin the US senator Chuck Schumer, and to call out certain other senators and their links to the NRA. It’s a subject even closer to her heart after two young women were shot in an American cinema while watching her movie Trainwreck. The day we meet, schoolkids are pouring out of their classrooms across the USA to demonstrate, “and I think once I start looking at that news footage I’ll just be crying all day,” she says. We discuss the Florida survivors, such as Emma Gonzalez. “These kids are really making an impact and I feel more hopeful right now than I thought possible,” she says. “This has been more movement than I thought that I would see in my lifetime. I think what they’re just realising is that the adults are not actually in control.”It’s also time for a change in Schumer’s own life. I ask about a typical day for her and she says that for the past 10 years, from the moment she woke up till she went to sleep, “I was driven and working and writing. Doing stand-up, you know, promoting something or filming something. I would say that, for 15 years, I was getting up at seven, going boxing, showering, going to the writer’s room all day, and having an interview during lunch. Afterward, maybe getting some sort of acupuncture before going and doing stand-up, and then having, like, 90 minutes when I could write when I got home. You know? That’s been it. I’ve been hustling for so long, I want to take care of myself now. I got really sick and it just made me realise I wasn’t invincible. I need to slow down.”One last thing though – can we just clear up the one-night-stand thing? Do you really mean you only had sex within relationships? “No! See to me, a one-night stand is where you meet someone that same day, you have sex with them, and then you never see them again. Sleeping with a friend or having sex with someone you know just once, no, I don’t consider that a one-night stand. I should make an addendum to that book. Something else I realised: I wrote that I don’t like watercress in the book. But I meant water chestnuts. So I need to publish two corrections, I guess.”I Feel Pretty is in cinemas in the UK and Ireland on 4 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf0c1b73929748bcd6ba9d1e63f5939e9d834e12/0_235_4270_2562/master/4270.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61377f477e36f0ac36104e840ec9b11d","title":"council of europe members suspected of corruption inquiry reveals","story":"Investigation into cash-for-votes allegations focused on Azerbaijan and concluded several former Pace MPs had breached code of conductSeveral members of the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly broke the body’s rules on ethics and are “strongly suspected” of corruption, according an internal inquiry.The report, revealed on Sunday, ends a 10-month investigation into cash-for-votes allegations focused on Azerbaijan, which have rocked the Strasbourg-based international organisation.The council, one of Europe’s oldest human rights organisations, was created in 1949 to safeguard democracy and the rule of law, it long predates the European Union and has 47 member states. Its parliamentary assembly (Pace) is composed of politicians from member countries’ national parliaments. Azerbaijan joined the council in 2001, but observers have long raised questions about Pace’s weak response to ballot-box stuffing and human rights violations in the oil-rich country.Pace set up the inquiry last year to investigate charges that former and current members had voted to soften criticism of Azerbaijan’s authoritarian government in exchange for cash and luxury gifts.“The investigation body established that there was a strong suspicion that certain current and former members of Pace had engaged in activity of a corruptive nature,” it added.The judges limited their investigation to Azerbaijan, however they did hear allegations against other member states, including Russia, Ukraine and Turkey.In a damning verdict on the former Pace president Pedro Agramunt, the inquiry concluded there were strong suspicions he had colluded in “corruptive activities” to gain a key position leading the parliament’s centre-right group. Agramunt was forced to resign as Pace president in 2017, after an unprecedented vote of no-confidence over his participation in a Russian government trip to Syria. In this report, the Spanish deputy was found to have played “a key role” in decisions favouring Azerbaijan.The report also names former Italian deputy Luca Volontè as suspected of “activities of a corruptive nature”. He had played “an important role” in undermining a report on political prisoners in Azerbaijan, that detailed how the judicial system was used to silence government critics. Although the report reflected widespread concerns of other human-rights groups, its findings were rejected by Pace MPs in a controversial 2013 vote.Italian police are investigating Volontè for corruption in relation to €2.39m (£2m) he is accused of taking in bribes from Azerbaijan. Volontè denies all charges and has been acquitted on a separate count of moneylaundering. The report appeared to exonerate MPs on a key point – accepting luxury gifts, such as caviar and all-expenses paid trips, as an inducement for favourable votes.Sir Nicolas Bratza, former president of the European court of human rights and one of the judges who investigated the claims, said they were “symbolic” and “courtesy gifts”. However, he expressed concern that some MPs did not follow internal rules on declaring gifts.Deputies from the parliamentary assembly’s 47 member countries will debate the report on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8b8b92c3613ff26be9a3632c56125c436e3cbbb/0_28_3777_2267/master/3777.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=296be0ff084ac3072a84ca7623374c7a","title":"everything you need to know about recovering from a marathon","story":"Your race is done, the medal is won.

The box is ticked, the medal is hanging around your neck.

Get into clean, dry clothes and comfy shoes: I’ll be staggering around slowly in Oofos slides, others swear by cheap flip-flops. Whatever you find comfortable. If you are a fan of compression gear, now is also the time to get into that (a challenge in itself, when it comes to climbing into those tights ... ). While the jury is out on the benefits of actually running in compression gear, it can definitely help aid recovery. Go for proper, quality compression like those from CEP. It’s one area where cheap options can be a false economy. If you have any very specific sore spots, noticeable immediately, you can try a topical product like a ‘freezing’ spray. Chris Roberts, a rehabilitation therapist, explains: “Cryotherapy products such as Biofreeze are topical analgesics, which work through a ‘counter-irritant’ mechanism. This creates a sensation that overrides pain signals to the brain. This process is known as ‘gate control theory’, where nerve impulses from one stimulus block the nerves containing pain signals to the brain. But it is important to remember that cryotherapy only provides temporary pain relief and is not a long-term solution if injury does occur.”A note on painkillers: please, please, think twice. NSAIDs – such as ibuprofen or aspirin – are a lot stronger than many people realise. No one wants to be in pain, but you also don’t want to mask injury and risk making it worse. Nor do you want to do damage to a body that’s just gone through quite an ordeal. NSAIDS can cause harm to your kidneys, which are already working overtime, given you are undoubtedly mildly dehydrated, at best, and increase your blood pressure to risky levels, as well as putting you at greater risk for hyponatremia. You can research, endlessly, the latest research into the right balance of protein vs carbs and the crucial post-race recovery window in which to eat them. And in an ideal world, you’ll have that three-parts carbsone-part protein snack waiting for you. However ... I’ve run 10 marathons and I know full well that sometimes you can’t even look at food after the race. You’ve just run 26.2 miles and your stomach is queasy, full of gels and in rebellion. Don’t worry, just try and eat whatever you can cope with, whether that’s an ice cream, a bag of crisps, a banana or a protein bar. Have a proper good meal later: heaven knows you’ve earned it. Or celebrate the next day when you feel up to it. Do, however, make sure you rehydrate – take the water you’ll be offered at the finish and keep sipping away for the rest of the day.Back in the comfort of your home or hotel room, it’s time to soak those aching limbs. So what’s better, hot or cold? “The research is ever changing in this area,” says Neil Smith, a physiotherapist at Pure Sports Medicine. “But I would say that ice baths are likely to be better for recovery than a hot bath. It may not be the first thing you want to inflict on yourself after 26.2 gruelling miles – but it does have some positive effects – including reducing Doms (delayed onset muscle soreness). However, if you really feel like a dip in a hot bath the evening of the marathon then no one is going to stop you!” Also note that you do not need access to a fancy cryogenic chamber: “How cold it should be is definitely a personal choice – but something in the region of 15C would work” says Smith. “Some athletes like to go as low as 8C – and that is still achievable with cold water and plenty of bags of ice.”However, Smith and his colleague Lisa Posnett are sceptical that Epsom salts, which are often recommended as a post-marathon remedy, make any difference. “Epsom salt is a common name for magnesium sulphate,” they say. “Despite it being used for decades, there is actually little evidence out there to support its use and muscle soreness alleviation. The idea behind it is it helps reduce magnesium deficiency. However, if it seems to work for you – even if it just provides a placebo effect – then go for it!”Many races will offer you a quick post-race massage. That can definitely help, but can also involve standing around in a queue, which itself can be a form of post-race torture. But if you can afford it, a proper sports massage is a really good idea. As Ellen Cook, sports massage therapist at Ten Health and Fitness says: “The sooner you can do this, the better, as it will flush out any lactic acid that has built up during the race and in turn reduce the build-up of muscle tension. Pushing ourselves that far can cause damage to the muscles. Sports massages help by warming up the muscle fibres through friction and improves blood flow and circulation. Once the muscles are warm they become more malleable, making it easier to release tension, re-align them and ultimately speeding up the healing process.”And if you’ve had a Torquemada-like experience, then don’t be put off. “There are many myths out there regarding sports massage,” says Cook. “The most common is that effective massage should hurt. This is not correct at all, there are many techniques for massage that are used to relieve muscle tension and sometimes going gung-ho on a muscle is not what it needs.” So don’t be afraid to ask your masseur to back off a bit: there are no prizes for enduring agony. Sleep is essential for recovery. However, this also comes under the “great idea in theory, hard in practice” rule. I have never slept well after a marathon. You are riding an adrenaline high (or, though I hope not, a crashing low) and every muscle in your legs is twitching and your system just can’t seem to shut down. Don’t worry – this is perfectly normal. Just rest. Don’t reach for the phone, just try to relax, listen to an audiobook, have another bath ... whatever helps you to drift off again. You’ll no doubt catch up and sleep like a log on subsequent nights.If your legs don’t feel like they fought a war the next day – and the day after that – then did you really run that marathon? But at what point do you know if it’s just a sore muscle, or something worse. “Doms can start a few hours after your exercise and will often peak at about 48-72 hrs, but can last up to even a week,” says Smith. “A lot of people find some gentle massaging and stretching can be helpful. If the pain lasts longer than a week or gets worse then I would suggest seeking some medical advice from a physio or doctor.” To some of you, that will be a no-brainer. Those legs are barely coping with stairs, let alone the idea of running again any time soon. Others, riding an adrenaline high, will be twitching to get back out there again after a few days. Don’t. You have nothing to gain, and a lot of torn muscle fibres that need to heal. If you crave being active, go for a swim, or do a gentle yoga class, but do not feel guilty about not doing any exercise if you don’t feel like it. Remember that elite athletes take a minimum of two very, very easy weeks to recover from a marathon, some longer. If you just want to get outside, gentle walking is a great way to stretch out sore legs.Your immune system, as well as your legs, has just taken a battering. Many people come down with a minor bug in the week after a marathon. So look after yourself, and try to eat healthily. Sure, you deserve celebratory treats, but your body needs to rebuild so be nice to it, and give it the micronutrients it deserves. As well as the cake. But don’t be surprised if elation soon turns to a touch of the blues. You’ve spent months planning and training for this event, and suddenly there’s a hole. Start thinking to the future: while you need to rest and recover, there’s no harm in starting to think of your next challenge. Follow all this advice (and if you have, you’re doing better than me. As my mum would say: “Do as I say, not as I do”) and you’ll soon – but not too soon – be back and raring to go. Use that marathon fitness and see what it can do to your 5k or 10k times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8526f93b23f30654de46214dcf8ed396298f1e47/169_335_1441_865/master/1441.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aba73ce3b9659f9eee8869412ef62b20","title":"jack monroe twitter labour vegan pub food","story":"As she turns 30, the activist and writer discusses social media, vegan pub food and her on-off love for LabourI imagine any time you meet Jack Monroe it always feels a bit like you have interrupted her mid-story. There is a brilliant indiscretion about her, as if her life is not entirely contained and you have turned up in the nick of time to try to help her keep a handle on it. On a Monday lunchtime last month she was in the big downstairs bar of the Railway Hotel in Southend-on-Sea, her local since she was in her teens, bunged up with a heavy cold, sniffing and apologising for sniffing.The Railway is designed to welcome strong characters. There is a pulpit at one end of the pub housing a DJ deck, as well as a drum kit and piano waiting for a band upstairs rooms promise art classes and poetry readings. “They put on a music class for people with learning difficulties, which is bonkers and fantastic, all tambourines and trumpets,” Monroe explains. The pub has been run for a decade by Dave and Fi Dulake, who are something of a Southend institution. “When they got married,” Monroe recalls, “they rode a tandem through town and people were coming out and cheering, running along behind, playing instruments. It was like our equivalent of a royal wedding.”The other reason she has chosen to come here is that the Railway serves some of the best vegan pub food around. “It went vegan about five years ago, long before I did,” Monroe says. “And it was one of the catalysts to make me realise vegan food could be really yummy.” (The other catalyst in her decision was a blog she wrote about visiting a slaughterhouse, the images and noises of which have never left her).I came to Southend and wrote a story about Monroe for this magazine four years ago. She was then still starting out on a journey that had begun when she blogged about trying to feed herself and her young son while living on desperately uncertain benefits, having lost her job with the local fire service. Since then it seems she has lived several lives. She has become a best-selling food writer and an indomitable campaigner against political austerity and for genderqueer rights (having identified as lesbian back then, she is now happily non-binary, though equally happy to be called “she” until someone comes up with a better pronoun). She has moved in to central London and then out again. She now lives at nearby Leigh-on-Sea, with her partner, a news editor at the BBC. “I need to live by the water. It is what keeps me sane. A pond just won’t cut it.” She has also – in an act that should afford her lifelong national treasure status – taken Katie Hopkins to court for libelling her on Twitter, and won a settlement against the former Mail Online columnist.When we meet, Monroe is eyeing up her 30th birthday the following week, a milestone that she seems determined to celebrate with abstention. She has given up drinking – partly because of the medication she is on for recently diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis. She is also cold turkeying from social media.“Twitter became like any addiction: ‘This makes me feel terrible! I want more of it!’ It is not productive. I have done more work in the last five days than for ages.”There was a point, she admits, when she had nine anonymised Twitter accounts, for various arguments, including a Scottish one, Benedict Cumberscotch, for the Scottish independence debate. Another was reserved to follow rightwingers she wanted to keep an eye on – “You know, all of the BNP plus Katie Hopkins.” She says she was trying to explain what it was like the other day to her mum. “I told her imagine going into work every morning and before you get to your desk everyone turning round to you and shouting: ‘You’re fat! You’re shit! You look like a minger!’ It’s a tough working environment …”She is currently testing food for a new book. She had her best version of macaroni cheese for breakfast and decides she will have it again now, too, because she wants to test theirs against hers. I have a vegan fish and chips, (recent winner of “Best Vegan Seafood Dish at the PETA food awards”) which turns out to be an almost Heston-like trompe l’oeil of a platter, with a big beer-battered “fish” that is a magically flaky blend of tapoica, wheat starch and knojac, served with hand-cut chips, pea puree and homemade tartare sauce.I ask Monroe about her current politics. She has fallen in and out of love with the Labour party. She was a fan of Ed Miliband, initially very sceptical of Jeremy Corbyn, mostly for his soft stance on the IRA (Monroe’s mother is northern Irish and she grew up on tales of the Troubles.) “I left for a bit, like a teenager, stomping about and slamming doors … Then after Jo Cox was murdered I grew up quite sharply,” she says. There was a time when she was thinking of running for selection as a Labour MP, and she does not rule that out. Her first act, she suggests, would be to try to organise “some kind of trade of Kate Hoey for Anna Soubry”.Monroe would make a terrific parliamentarian you can’t help feeling, though the Speaker might quickly be sensing the appeal of early retirement. You’d have to have a hard heart not to be swayed by her when she is in her stride, whether talking about animal welfare, or poverty, or (as the daughter of a firefighter and as a former station switchboard operator) Grenfell Tower. It was that authentic ability to cut through to the emotional core of our inequalities that first brought her a public and a platform. Bits of her early blogs went pretty much verbatim into Ken Loach’s film I, Daniel Blake – she had to walk out of the screening she went to because it all still seemed too hard to remember.There have been the inevitable attempts to co-opt her as a “celebrity” – offers to go into the jungle – which she has so far resisted. “I am actually holding out for Strictly,” she says, mostly in earnest. “Though I’d need to do it in the next couple of years before my joints give up.”We are on to puddings by now. She has a plate of banana fritters, which remind her of those that her dad used to get for her on the special occasions they had a Chinese takeaway.While we eat we talk a bit about her court case. Hopkins had suggested, entirely falsely, that Monroe had approved of defacing a war memorial. “I couldn’t let it go,” she says. “My brother served in Iraq. It was a very specific allegation which she refused to withdraw.”Though Hopkins did not face her in court, Monroe was subjected to three days of cross-examination in which she was required to read out the highlights of her own Twitter past. Referencing an old exchange with Piers Morgan, for example, she had to “explain to my learned friend how the word ‘twunt’ was a personal portmanteau of the words ‘twat’ and ‘cunt’, because neither seemed quite enough on its own …”The barrister was at pains to make Hopkins’s claims seem like “just words on the internet”. In response to that Monroe had six A4 ring binders of the abuse she had been sent some saying she would be pushed off a cliff or shot in the back of the head. She read them out, “crying and shaking – I said, ‘Imagine getting those words when you are trying to read your son a bedtime story.’”One of the benefits of winning the case is that the tabloid press has given her a wider berth since, she says. Walking to the train station she explains, irrepressibly, how much she is enjoying a slightly lower profile, a slightly more measured life. “I am not saying anything revolutionary,” she says. “Mostly I am just trying to make beans taste OK and saying that people need a decent place to live.” She joins me on the train back to London, and in the middle of a breathless story about fires she has helped to put out, just about manages to jump off at her stop.Cooking on a Bootstrap by Jack Monroe is published by Bluebird in August"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf6c992ae61b9cd641336dccdfc5ff8db048710c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b2b1e48a5318da6e918756a36cbcb58","title":"taste test falafel ice cream sandwiches vegetarian vegan snacks","story":"Meera Sodha rates high street sandwiches, pasta, burgers and moreTesco Wicked Kitchen smashin’ pumpkin falafel£3, tesco.comI like the colour.

Then Brexit happened. He tells the Observer of his fears and hopes for manufacturing, trade and investmentKoji Tsuruoka is sipping green tea in Japan’s splendid embassy in Mayfair, recalling how his first two years as Japan’s ambassador to the UK have not gone quite according to plan. At least, they haven’t turned out how his predecessors assured him they would. One after another, ex-ambassadors advised him, before he took up the position on 6 June 2016, that he would find the UK very “stable”, and its politics “very predictable”.A year later, after the Brexit bombshell caused global diplomatic and economic panic that reached Tokyo, Theresa May called a surprise general election that threw everything up in the air again. Thinking back to that period of turbulence, Tsuruoka stops for a few seconds and glances out of the window in the direction of Buckingham Palace. “Now I have to keep in mind that you don’t predict what is going to happen in the UK.”That said, he does quickly predict, in his diplomatic and soft-spoken way, that Brexit will bring considerable economic uncertainty to this country, in the short term at least. He spells out how decades of ever-increasing Japanese investment into the UK have already come to a halt for the time being. He is well qualified to judge how Brexit will pan out. Before coming to London, Tsuruoka spent three intense years negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that aims to reduce barriers between the US, Japan and 10 other Pacific nations. He knows as much as anyone about how international trade flows work, and about what is possible and what is not.This account of a relationship that strengthened year after year – in a period during which the UK was in the EU – raises a very obvious question. Will it continue to thrive after we have left? He replies decisively. “One thing I can say for certain, based on fact, is that the companies operating today in the UK are not expanding their investment in the UK today.”Huge Japanese firms with big plants in the UK – such as Nissan and Toyota, who sell most of their British-made cars into the EU – are, he says, treading water, biding their time before deciding whether to relocate part or all of their businesses, so they can continue to be based inside the single market after March 2019. He tries not to sound alarming, but is clear about the threat to UK jobs. “They are currently considering and thinking and watching very closely what they need to do. That is why they are not investing additionally today.“If you are proposing in your board meeting in a company that you need to invest more and build more cars in the UK today today there will be questions, and those are questions that are very difficult to answer today with certainty and therefore decisions are put off.”For Japanese enterprises which came to the UK to sell into EU markets, tariff-free trade is the guiding star that decides where they locate.“The reason that many of those companies have come is that this is the best gateway to Europe,” he says. “If that is in danger, if that is no longer sustainable, of course they will have to look at what they will have to do best. The existing arrangement for the single market is a total frictionless trade.”He believes membership of the single market is as good as it gets for Japanese firms wanting to sell into the EU from European bases. “The EU is a very exceptional single market. I don’t think the single market could be substituted by something and be better or even be the same.”It is not a uniform picture across the whole economy. There are sectors, such as software design, where the UK is still attractive, as it has the R\u0026ampD expertise and skills. He cites the example of how Japan’s SoftBank agreed, after the referendum, to buy the British software design firm Arm Holdings for £24.3bn in the hope that it would become a global leader.“That is one representation of what will go on and that was based on the assessment that the R\u0026ampD, the hi-tech capability, the potential for the UK succeeding further in this area, was quite concrete… those technologies are not necessarily linked to the EU.”Factory-based businesses, however – those producing goods for European markets rather than merely designing them – are a very “different issue”. They face real uncertainties if and when the terms of trade change. So too do Japanese financial institutions in the City, Japanese banks and other organisations offering financial services.The fact they will no longer have passporting rights to operate into EU markets will have significant effects on employment here. “It is an issue – because having passporting rights to reach the single market and be part of the single market is a very efficient and cost-saving way of conducting financial services which is a regulated industry.” Will Japanese banks up sticks and go? No, he says, not lock, stock and barrel, because Europe is just part of their market. But jobs will head out of the City into the EU and Japanese companies will have to reduce their operations in London. “They are not leaving London, because London is a global financial centre, not just a centre for the EU – but they will have to relocate some of their EU business to the EU in order to continue serving the EU consumers.”He is at pains not to talk down the UK’s post-Brexit prospects. Just as no one thought Brexit would happen when he arrived, no one can know for definite that it will turn out badly, as it approaches.“If you take a longer term, five, 10, 20 years… things become more unpredictable,” he says. But he is clear that in the shorter term it will not be good for the UK economy nor the strength of its economic partnership with Japan.He says Japan has not yet begun talks with the UK on a post-Brexit trade deal and that it would take several years to complete, if one is struck at all. It is another area of real uncertainty in the entirely unpredictable post-Brexit world that he never expected to encounter on arriving in London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f956ae3020ff1d9e2c8879f5e73b26bcb010fdc/500_799_5085_3051/master/5085.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c606317e8581ad743342548da66cfc5a","title":"tower hamlets labour win in londons diverse borough is far from certain","story":"Mayoral hopeful Rabina Khan aims to forge a new coalition in the ethnically erse London boroughA team of half a dozen Labour leafleters wait outside an East End primary school on a warm afternoon just off Roman Road street market in the gentrifying suburb of Bow. The party’s message is that schools are facing spending cuts imposed by the central government the target audience is the predominantly Bengali women picking up children, a group that party campaigners otherwise struggle to reach in an area where the Bangladeshi vote is critical.Outside the school is the diminutive figure of John Biggs, the incumbent directly elected mayor. But the Labour politician’s path to the top job in the borough that contains the gleaming towers of Canary Wharf and the traditional East End has been anything but easy. This time around Biggs faces the same principal opponent, Rabina Khan, a local councillor who leads the People’s Alliance for Tower Hamlets (Path), but much else has changed. Rahman, who once backed Khan, is now supporting another independent candidate, the Aspire party’s Ohid Ahmed. With Labour’s popularity in London greater than it was in 2105, and his principal opponents ided, it appears to be Biggs’s election to lose.“When I became mayor it was the end of a period of some controversy in the borough. The easy bit was clearing out the politics the harder bit was improving the quality of our services,” Biggs says, arguing that Labour is the only party that represents the borough as a whole.“Whatever Lutfur Rahman did, whether it was good or bad, it was about a very isive politics that was very segregated. He predominately focused on one community.”However, Khan believes she can put together an alternative coalition to take on Labour. The Bengali councillor talks about “a Tower Hamlets for all” and says she would like to create “a cross-party cabinet with all the political groups”.

Let’s not forget Cable Street when Oswald Mosley and his blackshirts tried to march through and people came together,” Khan says, and highlights the need to combat Islamophobia and antisemitism in the borough today.At Tower Hamlets, the mayor appoints a cabinet, although most of the power resides in the directly elected leader, who needs the support of the full council to ensure the budget is passed.Khan was a cabinet member for housing when Rahman was executive mayor. She says her experience of the time, in obtaining funding from Boris Johnson’s mayoralty, demonstrates that it is possible for council leaders to succeed outside the mainstream political parties. “I was 1,400 votes behind Biggs last time on first preferences, and he had a party machinery against me,” she adds.But such is her falling-out with Rahman-backed Ahmed, (who did not respond to requests for an interview by the ) that the two were reportedly engaged in a public “shouting match” at a community centre. Some independent locals say it is far from certain that second-preference votes would transfer from Khan’s Path to Ahmed’s Aspire or vice versa in an anti-Labour challenge. In 2015 Biggs won over Khan by 27,255 against 25,763 in the first round. But the Labour candidate won 5,499 second preferences against 621 for Khan.Such personality-driven politics is arguably encouraged by a system of directly elected mayors, used only by a minority of London boroughs. Without it Rahman would probably not have become Britain’s first directly elected Muslim mayor in 2010 after the Labour party stripped him of his nomination.Biggs says that brought with it further difficulties. “The problem was that Lutfur Rahman tested what happens when you get a maverick person elected,” he adds.In neighbouring Newham, where Labour is expected to win easily, the party’s first-time mayoral candidate, Rokhsana Fiaz, wants to have a referendum on whether to continue the system after she wrested the nomination from Sir Robin Wales who had been mayor and the borough’s dominating presence since 2002. Fiaz emphasises a more personal tone and she wants to consult residents on major decisions and developments by using citizen assemblies. She says: “I can understand why people might feel cynical. But I am committed, my instinct is to be very open and involving. The council has become too remote.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee17e2273717f67beda3abae8fe170c1d197d072/0_131_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5e5e00bfe8141e8918947c0330e05db","title":"welsh finance minister mark drakeford carwyn jones","story":"Labour leader heralds ‘tireless’ work of Carwyn Jones, who announced departure after pressure over the death of Carl Sargeant Jeremy Corbyn has brushed off the idea that the Welsh first minister is leaving office under a cloud after Carwyn Jones announced he was stepping down as the pressure over the death of Carl Sargeant intensified.Corbyn thanked Jones for his “tireless” work as leader of Labour in Wales and said he had been a strong voice for democracy, devolution and standing up for the Welsh people. Asked if Jones was leaving under a cloud, Corbyn said that he was departing with a great deal of affection. However, there is little doubt that Jones’s nine-year spell as first minister will be most remembered for the tragedy of Sargeant, who killed himself shortly after he was sacked by Jones when he faced allegations of harassment. Among the early frontrunners to take over is Mark Drakeford, the finance secretary, who said he was thinking “very seriously” about standing. Another possible candidate is Vaughan Gething, who became the first black minister in any devolved UK administration five years ago.A row is already brewing over how the new first minister will be elected.Shortly before Jones announced he was stepping down, the Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris won the Welsh Labour deputy leadership election through an electoral college system – rather than one member, one vote.Her rival Julie Morgan, whose late husband, Rhodri, was first minister before Jones, lost despite being backed by more party members.  There are growing calls for the new leader to be elected under one member, one vote. Corbyn said the method used was up to the Welsh Labour party. Jones, who will leave in the autumn, said he had faced the “darkest times” in recent months. He has been under intense pressure since Sargeant’s death and his position had been made more awkward by the election of Sargeant’s son, Jack, to the Alyn and Deeside parliamentary seat in north Wales. Last week, opposition parties in Wales fiercely criticised the government for blocking the full publication of a report examining claims that news of Sargeant’s dismissal was leaked in the days before his death.A day before Jones’s announcement, lawyers for Jack Sargeant published a letter accusing Jones of causing considerable distress. The main inquiry into the Sargeant affair has not yet begun and Jones promised he would answer every question asked.  Jones is an experienced election campaign leader, who has guided Welsh Labour to a string of victories. Together with the Scottish National party, he has played an important role in holding the UK government to account over Brexit. There is a danger that his announcement will weaken that position. Until the Sargeant tragedy, Jones was regarded as a safe pair of hands who may not have been as charismatic or well-known as his predecessor Rhodri Morgan, but appealed to a broad range of voters and Labour party activists.After the defeat of the Labour party in the 2010 UK general election and the resignation of Gordon Brown as prime minister, Jones became the most senior Labour leader in power. Since then, one of his missions has been to protect Wales against the impact of austerity. His government’s record in the devolved areas of education and health have been frequently attacked by political opponents in Westminster, but he has defended his administration robustly. Under his watch, the Welsh assembly has been given power to make its own laws and to raise some tax revenues. Jones, who is married with two children, is particularly proud of a landmark scheme under which people are deemed to have consented to organ donation unless they opt out that has been credited with saving lives. In an interview with the  shortly before Sargeant’s death to mark the 20th anniversary of Welsh devolution, Jones said he believed that Wales was more successful and confident than two decades ago. He said he was also much more confident, buoyed by excellent results in the general election and was still enjoying the top job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af218554e4963b60060d54459444d8daffe2b343/0_28_5467_3281/master/5467.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6162eba839099f8a76299d027607e28","title":"councils sit on 375m earmarked for affordable housing","story":"Despite ‘severe’ need for lower cost homes in some areas, funding is not being releasedLocal councils in England are sitting on hundreds of millions of pounds of money designated for affordable housing.The cash has been accumulated under so-called section 106 agreements by which builders and developers give a council a ringfenced amount of money instead of building affordable homes within a development themselves.James Prestwich, the head of policy at the National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said it confirmed the federation’s view that section 106 was flawed. “Affordable housing should be delivered within new developments, rather than developers simply funding its delivery elsewhere,” he said. “This would guarantee that affordable housing will be built alongside other homes.”Some of the worst offenders shown up by research carried out by the Huffington Post are in London and the south-east. The housing minister Dominic Raab’s own local council, Elmbridge in Surrey, has £8m waiting to be invested.Raab was criticised this month after he blamed high levels of immigration for increasing house prices. A review by the statistics watchdog found that his department had used an outdated statistical method to calculate the causes of housing pressure and their relationship with house prices. The London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which has yet to find new homes for two-thirds of the Grenfell survivors and other families affected by the disaster, has £21m of dedicated reserves. It says £19m has been set aside for Grenfell families.Two Labour-held councils also in London, Southwark and Camden, between them have more than £90m that could be spent on affordable homes. Altogether, just 14 councils account for two-thirds of the unspent cash.A spokesman for Southwark said the money it had was already allocated and the projects for which it was intended would be completed within the next five years. Camden has set up a new scheme for affordable home building, the community investment programme, which is intended to create 1,400 affordable homes over 15 years.Tony Travers, a local government expert at the London School of Economics, said nearly a decade of cuts had left council capacity to manage big projects “hollowed out”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69693aca70d3e029bf5e291f629672c9f455f6fb/348_529_2481_1488/master/2481.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05331d2971af79dd8beb0bada8cce306","title":"what we must learn from asperger expose","story":"It has taken me a while to digest Herwig Czech’s deeply upsetting information about Hans Asperger (Revealed: how Doctor Asperger aided the Nazi project, 19 April).When, in 1991, I translated Asperger’s seminal 1944 paper on “Autistic psychopathy in childhood”, none of this was known. Neither Lorna Wing, the instigator of the translation, nor I believed he was part of the Nazi machinery of death. My translation, footnotes and description of Asperger in the introductory chapter were based on scant sources: the paper itself, a few media sources (eg an interview he gave in the 1970s) and an interview with his daughter. As a clinical psychologist and academic, I thought highly of his clinical descriptions, which largely highlighted the positive aspects of what has become known as Asperger syndrome.It is very saddening that he appears to have been a willing accomplice in the Nazi euthanasia programme. It seems certain now that he effectively signed the death warrants of children with severe brain damage, while at the same time providing educational therapy for the children in his clinic.The term Asperger syndrome is not in the most recent diagnostic systems, for scientific reasons, but it will be up to the autism community to decide whether it should remain in use.Uta FrithEmeritus professor of cognitive development, UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience• While researching autism’s history at Oxford, I became the first openly autistic postgraduate in the UK to win the Wellcome Trust’s PhD studentship. That Asperger helped Nazis euthanise disabled children, if true, is horrifying. But it should not obscure our memory. Throughout this period, American and British psychiatrists endorsed eugenicist ideologies and sometimes heinous acts. To list but a few examples: autism’s co-discoverer in America, Leo Kanner, supported sterilisation for the mentally disabled, while Foster Kennedy, chairman of the American Psychiatric Association, advocated a US euthanasia programme to be modelled upon the Nazis’. In England, Winston Churchill endorsed the Mental Deficiency Act 1913, mandating that all “imbeciles” be separated from society and involuntarily committed to labour camps, typically for the rest of their lives. Amid often awful squalor, many deteriorated and died.Hitler’s rationale seems less distant from even modern political rhetoric than many imagine. Nazis spoke of “useless eaters”, those “hereditary defectives” certain to cost the government thousands of marks per year.The real lesson of Czech’s study, it seems, is not that Asperger was a monster – even if he was – but that we must understand his ideological mistake if we are never to repeat it. Asperger associated autism with capacity for brilliance. But even when it isn’t, even when a disability entails no such thing, the life of the disabled person – their security, their freedom, their inidual potential – becomes not a shred less valuable. Sahil Singh GujralNew York, USAAs one would expect, the interview is his biggest challenge. However, apart from occasional readjustment of the furniture to make the process more “friendly”, no concessions are made. The same questions are asked, the same requirements of social communication expected. Employers’ expectation seems to be that applicants on the autism spectrum should “step up” to their mindset, rather than the other way around. And take it from me and my son – all those “disability friendly” logos on job websites mean very little.My son currently works part-time in a supermarket.

Yet deep down the Kenyan’s victory, his third here, merely confirmed what most spectators already knew: he is the finest 26.2-miler of all time. A much greater surprise was to be found further down The Mall, where Mo Farah was holding on for third in a British record of 2hr 6min 21sec.True, it was still two minutes behind Kipchoge, who glided home in 2:04:17 – a staggering feat on a day where temperatures topped 24C, a race record by two degrees. Yet Farah’s performance showed that the doubters, who suspected he was running London solely for one last massive payday before hanging up his Nike Vaporfly Elites, were wide of the mark.“I really enjoyed it - even though over the last 10km I was bollocksed,” said Farah, delighted at tasting sweet redemption after flopping in his first marathon attempt in 2014. “To run a personal best, break the British record and finish on the podium. It can’t get better than that.”The 35-year-old ides opinion as few other British sportsmen. Yet remarkably he now holds national records over 1500m, 3,000m, 5,000m, 10,000m, the half-marathon and the marathon. Those performances inspire awe in some quarters and suspicion in others – given that his former coach Alberto Salazar, who turned him into a world-beater, remains under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency.But whatever one’s view, Farah’s belief he could be a marathon medal contender at next year’s world championships and at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo no longer appears outlandish – especially given he was able to handle a devilishly fast pace and stick with Kipchoge until 18 miles before his legs and spirit finally began to buckle.“If I can run 2hr 06min in a major championship, it shows I can be competitive,” Farah said. “I’ve beaten some good runners. I’m satisfied. I fought as much as I could.”The race began with a collective moment of madness, as the field rushed through the first mile in an astonishing 4min 22sec. Farah had intended to attach himself to a slower group, with the aim of reaching halfway in 61min\u0026nbsp45sec. Instead he realised that, because everyone else was going with Kipchoge, who reached 13.1 miles in 61 minutes flat, he had to do so as well.That was not the only thing to throw him. Farah’s coach, Gary Lough, had prepared his drinks bottles with a highly potent carbohydrate solution. Yet at the 10km mark Farah picked up the wrong bottle, leaving him to remonstrate with one of the support crew when they pulled up on a motorbike beside him.“I was table four but the staff was trying to take pictures and I was trying to take a drink,” Farah said. “Me and the other athlete from Ethiopia had the exact same bottle and were on the same table, too. So I was telling the people: ‘Can you please just tell us which one is our drink because it’s exactly the same bottle.’”To make matters worse Farah then picked up and dropped his bottle at 20km, losing more valuable metres. Perhaps it should not have been a surprise for while Farah was back on familiar turf, close to the scene of his Olympic 5,000m and 10,000m triumphs at London 2012, the marathon is still largely alien territory. As Paula Radcliffe pointed out, Farah could have avoided the problem by making his drinks bottle more distinctive.Despite his lack of bottle, Farah was still in contention and even moved up to Kipchoge’s shoulder after 18 miles. But it was the briefest of mirages. Soon he was slipping back, leaving the 21-year-old Ethiopian Tola Kitata and Kipchoge to duke it out in front, with the latter finally breaking clear near the end to win by 32 seconds.“I was a little bit worried,” a smiling Kipchoge said. “But I said it would be a beautiful race and it was.”Farah noted with regret that he had run his first half too quickly, in 61 minutes, before coming home in 65. And while he insisted afterwards that he was still learning, he also knows Kipchoge runs in a different stratosphere.“Eliud is a great athlete,” he said. “He makes it look so easy. I came across at 30km, absolutely knackered at that point, and he just changed gear and kicked on. But could you have got a better field? I beat Kenenisa Bekele, Daniel Wanjuri, so many good guys. I will take time to improve, as I took my time to win medals on the track.”Kipchoge, meanwhile, calmly celebrated his 10th victory in 11 marathons - unprecedented in such a gruelling event where so many things can go wrong - as if nothing could have been easier. At his training camp in Kenya, where he takes his turn to clean out the toilets, they call him the “boss man”. In London, he again proved master of his domain."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3459762.1524066741!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"getting up close and digital with nature s miniature life","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBumblebee at broad bean flowers. Illustration: Michael VineyWith a teenager’s devotion to a wild idea, I once turned the family greenhouse into a photographic darkroom. It was the only uncontested space, and its cardboard blackout was proof against all but the brightest chinks of starlight. My first enlarger, conjured from a mysterious, fatherly deal in the pub, was an Edwardian antique of mahogany and brass. It stretched horizontally along the potting bench, the bellows extending on tracks. Its fist-size lens threw a diamond-sharp image, once I had managed to sandwich my modest square of film where the big glass plate of a negative used to go.Making a print was slow, messy and laborious, involving smelly chemicals. As I became more ambitious, the cost of a perfect 10 x 8 print, its darks rich and velvety, could be quite high. But the feeling of accomplishment, of solitary, magical creativity, was incomparable. Moving a digital image from camera to computer screen, all with a click or two, misses out on a whole slice of youthful fulfilment.My first camera, an aged twin-lens Voigtlander, could not focus nearer than a metre. With wooden tripod tied to my crossbar, I cycled off into the countryside for landscapes and quaint corners of stockbroker villages while haunted by Ansel Adams’s wild and wonderful boulders and peaks of Yosemite, borrowed from the town library.Half a century on, in the digital age, I also delight in a different scale of nature – its miniatures – as the rich flow of images from readers arrives at “Eye on Nature”. The capacity of smartphone cameras to get in close, often to a hand’s breadth of the subject, has embraced the beauty and interest of the single flower or woodland mushroom, the single beetle or bumblebee, the inidual butterfly or moth, and (I sometimes shrink to see) the poised and solitary spider. Along with the images comes the quest to know more, which Ethna tries to satisfy.Among Europe’s finest close-up photographers is Dr Robert Thompson, who is based in Banbridge, Co Down. An entomologist, he knows what everything is and where it’s likely to be. I met up with him once in the dunes along the shore and marvelled at the range of Nikon hardware clustered weightily across his chest: if not this camera, then that one, and whichever lens, tripod, knee pads or ancillary gadget needed for the shot.Thompson’s classic work has already been seen in weighty volumes of dragonflies, butterflies and moths published by the Ulster Museum. He has now produced a masterly guide, Close-up and Macro Photography: Its Art and Fieldcraft Techniques. It’s not cheap – €41 even in the hefty, large-format paperback – but it is visually thrilling and technically exhaustive.Thompson’s life as a professional natural history photographer means marketing flawless photos with impact and a personal style: “branding”, as he puts it. Along with the right exposure, white balance, colour temperature and expertise with clinical software comes an artistic gift for an image that draws a gasp.The fieldcraft offered by Thompson, moving from one habitat to another, can be beguilingly practical, as in keeping one’s head off the skyline while stalking dragonflies perched at a pond, or searching for the one mushroom the slugs haven’t got to.Wind and weather count as much as knowing where and when to look, and blue-sky, breezy days are definitely not the best. There are flexible yokes to hold a flower still (among them the wonderful “Wimberley Plamp”), tripods that sprawl obligingly flat on the ground, and screens that diffuse the overly harsh light of bright sun.Early morning finds the light kindest and insects still torpidly waiting to be warmed into life. When they’re flying, a light shower of rain can bring them down to the leaves and add sparkling drops to a flower or a dragonfly’s wing. In winter, soft mist can bejewel a spider’s web or frost coat a seed head or berry in diamonds.Close-up and “macro” photography are not the same: the latter means images often greatly enlarged from life. Not everyone enjoys inspecting the glaze on a wasp’s eyeball. Thompson usually settles for doubling the size, perhaps with telephoto lens and extension tube. If there is a special style to his work, it shows up well in his exquisite studies of day-flying moths pretending to be tree bark and of ineffably elegant caterpillars and dragonflies, or flowers showing off their stamens.His scope widens to lichens, fungi, rock pools and streams (bring your own aquarium and put everything back where you found it). And given his ruthless perfectionism – every hair glistening, every petal immaculate – it is reassuring to be told that smartphone and mobile phone cameras can often yield “acceptable” images.

File photograph: Hayes DavidsonAFPGetty ImagesThere are “alarming deficiencies” in the UK’s approach to assessing impacts of plans to expand its nuclear power programme on Ireland, according to the Irish Environmental Pillar (EP). In addition, particular risks associated with the Hinkley Point C power station being built in Somerset have not been properly evaluated, it claims.The £20 billion Hinkley Point C facility, the first British nuclear power station to be built in 30 years, is less than 250km from Rosslare, Co Wexford. It is one of five new nuclear plants planned for locations on the west coast of the UK facing Ireland.The shortcomings in the Hinkley project and lack of State input into “a long overdue public consultation process” is highlighted by a submission by the EP – a coalition of major Irish environmental organisations. After a five-year legal battle, consultation began on February 20th with submissions collected by the Government – they will be submitted to the UK authorities. It concluded on April 17th amid continuing controversy over further consultations on the UK’s nuclear programme relating to radioactive waste which have not been notified to the Irish public. The EP welcomed confirmation that the Oireachtas committee on planning would have a hearing on the issue. Its submission claims the original environmental impact assessment (EIA) to grant development consent was and remains compromised by the UK’s failure to consult its “transboundary neighbours” in accordance with its international and EU legal obligations.“The UK should suspend works on Hinkley Point C pending the outcome of this consultation and conduct a full EIA in the best interest of the safety of UK citizens and those in neighbouring countries,” it adds.The Government, it says, has shown “a lack of proactive engagement to secure consultation rights and proactively promote the interests of the Irish citizens” on these issues. “A serious nuclear accident would open up a Pandora’s box of potential problems for our island, including an estimated economic loss of €161 billion and devastation of our agriculture,” it claims.It says the health impact of normal operational emissions has not been properly assessed.The submission suggests the UK failed to adequately assess the future impact on Ireland, given serious failures in the consideration of climatological factors, flooding and seismic risks at Hinkley. It points to a lack of assessment of the potential impact of the disposal of radioactive waste arising from the operation of the plant on its neighbours, notably Ireland, especially as the UK is considering development of underground or undersea storage for radioactive waste, including locations in Northern Ireland and under marine waters.It also points to a lack of emergency response capacity in Ireland. The HSE recently warned the State had no capacity at present to deal with a nuclear accident. Attracta Uí Bhroin, environmental law implementation group facilitator at the Irish Environmental Network, said: “Our main concern is the UK has yet to adequately assess the impact of normal operations and an accident on Ireland and the Irish public.”The State compounded its earlier failures to extend this consultation last July, when it was happening in other European countries, by its failure to take effective action to make people aware of this consultation, she said.“We need to ensure our Government is also vigilant on associated nuclear infrastructure such as dumps for radioactive waste – a direct consequence of the UK’s nuclear power plants.” The EP was also concerned with complications arising from Brexit, she said, with the UK signalling its intention to withdraw from the Euratom treaty on nuclear material transport, safety and waste.

Photograph: Bryan O’BrienMembers of the Irish Postmasters’ Union will be balloted on proposals by An Post to save the network.Several hundred members of the union attended a meeting in Tullamore on Sunday at which they received a briefing from the union’s executive.The executive said it had voted unanimously to approve the deal from An Post which was negotiated over three months by senior counsel Turlough O’Donnell.The €50 million deal – announced last week – will secure the future of most of the 1,000-strong post office network around the country.IPU president Paddy McCann urged members before the Sunday meeting to vote in favour of the deal, saying that it is the “best possible negotiated solution for the future of the Post Office network” and ensures the viability of as large a network as possible.The ballot will take place on May 11th and results will be known a couple of weeks after that.The  reported on Saturday that a memo brought to Cabinet last week stated An Post will have to cut 2,000 jobs – nearly a quarter of its workforce – over the next four years to secure its future. This was despite earlier optimistic forecasts from management.The warning to members of the Cabinet were given in a confidential briefing to Ministers, just days before An Post announced a €50 million investment in the post office network.An Post, in response, said the figure of 2,000 jobs cuts is from a strategic review in March 2017 and since then the company has “achieved a major turnaround and is performing well ahead of plan”.Pointing to a 30 per cent increase in parcel volume over the last year, it said parcel activity was at such a high level that An Post does “not now anticipate job reductions of this magnitude”.Its latest figures released last week show an increase in revenue of 1.2 per cent to €840 million in 2017. The company made a profit of €8.4 million against losses of €12.4 million in 2016.An Post’s revenues were also buoyed by the increase in the cost of a postage stamp to €1.Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"bertie ahern abruptly ends interview after being questioned on mahon tribunal","story":"  April 21, 2018Former taoiseach \u0026lsquohappy\u0026rsquo he cleared his name after allegations he received payments   April 22, 2018Fianna F\u0026aacuteil leader praises former taoiseach\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquotireless work for peace\u0026rsquo in Northern Ireland Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3470451.1524427155!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nuj calls on naughten to recuse himself over inm lobbyist call","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Communications Denis Naughten. Séamus Dooley, the NUJ’s Irish secretary, called on the Minister to recuse himself voluntarily from involvement in media regulation.The National Union of Journalists has called on Minister for Communications Denis Naughten to recuse himself from media regulation for telling a lobbyist for a media company about plans to review a takeover it was planning.Séamus Dooley, the NUJ’s Irish secretary, said it would be “entirely inappropriate” for Mr Naughten to retain responsibility for regulatory matters relating to Independent News \u0026amp Media (INM) or radio group Communicorp while the High Court was considering if his behaviour led to a breach of stock market rules on inside information.The  revealed last week that Mr Naughten told a lobbyist working for INM on a phone call in 2016 that he intended to refer the company’s proposed takeover of Celtic Media regional newspaper group to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, a regulator, two months before he officially announced his decision.Mr Naughten’s view, expressed to lobbyist Eoghan Ó Neachtain, a former government press secretary, was passed on to INM’s then chairman Leslie Buckley, who then informed Denis O’Brien, INM’s biggest shareholder and the owner of Communicorp.The contacts were disclosed in court papers filed by the State’s corporate watchdog, who investigated INM and said Mr Buckley may have shared “inside information” and potentially breached market abuse regulations. Director of corporate enforcement Ian Drennan is seeking to have High Court inspectors appointed to investigate this and a range of other issues at INM.In his court papers, Mr Drennan claims that a range of breaches may have possibly occurred at INM including breaches by the company under legislation in which the Minister for Communications has a role. Mr Dooley criticised Mr Naughten’s refusal to engage directly with the NUJ on the later-abandoned merger while he had “no difficulty in taking a phone call from a third-party PR consultant” about the proposed takeover.Speaking on Sunday at the NUJ’s delegate conference in Southport, England, Mr Dooley called on the Minister to recuse himself voluntarily from involvement in media regulation “in order to avoid a conflict of interest or perceived conflict of interest” pending the outcome of the INM case. Discussing the controversy on Sunday, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said he would not have a personal conversation as Mr Naughten said he did with a lobbyist acting for INM.In defending what he said on the phone call, Mr Naughten sought to draw a distinction between the “purely personal view” he shared with the lobbyist and a subsequent decision affecting INM he would make as a minister.Asked on RTÉ’s The Week in Politics if he would ever give a “personal opinion” in such circumstances, Mr Flanagan said: “I wouldn’t because I’m speaking as Minister for Justice.”When asked if he would ever speak in a personal capacity as a Minister, Mr Flanagan said: “Well, as Minister for Justice it’s very difficult to speak in a personal capacity. I acknowledge my role and capacity.”Mr Flanagan said Mr Naughten had acknowledged he had made a mistake, but insisted that no confidential or market sensitive information was passed by the Minister to INM through its lobbyist. “This was not the third secret of Fatima. The dogs in the street were barking it,” said Mr Flanagan.However, senior Fine Gael sources said they expected the controversy to drag into this week. Privately, Fine Gael Ministers are sharply critical of Mr Naughten.Social Democrats TD Catherine Murphy said she had “a serious concern” about future conflicts of interest and that the Minister should recuse himself because he had an “ongoing responsibility” for regulating media mergers.“If we are to have confidence in the decisions that are going to be made, he has to recuse himself,” she said.We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3470273.1524415520!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"germany s spd party elects its first woman leader in 155 years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  Andrea Nahles  after she was elected SPD  leader in Wiesbaden, Germany.  Photograph: EPAClemens BilanGermany’s oldest political party, the Social Democrats (SPD), made history on Sunday by electing its first woman leader in 155 years, Andrea Nahles (47). However, her hopes of renewing her struggling party, down to just 18 per cent in polls, were dealt a blow when a third of delegates declined to back her candidacy.Just 66.4 per cent support is the second worst result in the party’s post-war history, narrowly ahead of the 1995 election of Oskar Lafontaine. He once dubbed Nahles, then a young, fiery left-winger, a “gift from God” to their party. Now a pragmatic centrist with a leftist tinge, Ms Nahles will need all her political gifts to rebuild her enfeebled party while serving as junior coalition partner to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) in Berlin. “It’s possible to renew a party from government, and I want to deliver the proof starting tomorrow,” Ms Nahles said at a party conference on Sunday in Wiesbaden. Five weeks after entering their third grand coalition since 2005, the SPD remains a house ided over supporting a fourth Merkel term and 15-year-old welfare reforms that helped the German economy bounce back while undermining their party support base.Inheriting an ambivalent, insecure party, Ms Nahles, a former labour minister at the Merkel cabinet table, is building a power centre in the Bundestag where she will also serves as SPD floor leader. Ms Nahles is the seventh SPD leader Dr Merkel has seen since she took over the CDU in 2000. The last, Martin Schulz, lasted less than a year. He proved that 100 per cent delegate support is no guarantee of success, scoring just 20.5 per cent in last September’s federal election – the party’s worst result since 1949.In a fiery speech Ms Nahles vowed to tackle populist nationalism that posed a “threat to the basic democratic order” by restoring social democracy as the guarantor of social justice and solidarity. “Solidarity is what’s lacking most in this globalised, neo-liberal, turbo-digital world.” She blamed last year’s weak result on “not saying how we wanted to reach our goal of justice”.Ms Nahles gave few clues to her future strategy on Sunday, allowing challenger Simone Lange – a low-profile mayor of the northern German city of Flensburg – read her party the riot act.After spending all but four of the last 20 years in power, Ms Lange said the SPD had “crippled itself” with a lack of “team spirit, openness and credibility”. The daily reality of its neo-liberal reforms, she said, were €416 a month basic welfare and a risk of old-age poverty even after a lifetime of working. “For all of this I would like to apologise,” she said, promising to rescind the reforms if elected. “We are destroying our social circumstances if we don’t wake up and own up to our own debate.” Despite being a political unknown, with a last-minute candidacy, Ms Lange took 172 of 631 delegate votes.Leading SPD figures made the most of the result, with parliamentary deputy leader Carsten Schneider calling it an “honest result”.A Bild tabloid poll on Sunday found two-thirds of Germans think a revived SPD would be good for the country, but just a quarter of Germans think Ms Nahles is the woman to do so – down from a third in February.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the Guardian. “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3470371.1524421060!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may could face cabinet revolt over customs union","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s environment secretary Michael Gove “fully supports the prime minister’s position” on  leaving the customs union.   Photograph:  Chris J RatcliffeGetty ImagesTheresa May could face a cabinet revolt on a customs union as peers prepare to inflict more defeats on the government over the EU withdrawal bill in a key week for the future of the UK’s relations with Europe. Amid Brexiter threats of a leadership challenge, the former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan who chairs the Treasury committee, told the challengers to be careful what they wished for. “This sabre-rattling is not coming from the section of the party that I represent. It is coming from the pro-Brexit section of the party and is deeply unhelpful,” she said. Although it has not been officially confirmed, there are well-founded reports that government ambitions to avoid a hard border in Ireland either through technological innovation or regulatory alignment have been rejected in preliminary negotiations in Brussels.That has led to speculation that May is preparing to concede on a customs union, which has been a red line since the prime minister’s conference speech in October 2016. Reports over the weekend suggested a “wargaming” exercise into the consequences of a concession showed that not even leading Brexiters like Michael Gove, the environment secretary, or Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, would resign.But on Sunday a source close to Michael Gove reiterated the environment secretary’s opposition. “Michael believes respecting the referendum result means taking back control of trade policy. He fully supports the prime minister’s position that this means leaving the customs union.”Although the loss of other pledges in negotiations have been reluctantly accepted, such as the promise to reclaim control over fishing quotas from March 2019, accepting continued membership of a customs union would be of a different and much larger scale. Downing Street sources also dismissed the idea. “The position remains very clear: we don’t think staying in a customs union is the right thing to do and it isn’t government policy to do so,” a spokesperson said.Any customs union makes it effectively impossible to negotiate free trade deals with other countries – one of the government’s key ambitions and a central justification for leaving the EU. But a meaningful vote on remaining in the customs union is likely in the next few months. At least 10 Tory backbenchers have signed an amendment to the trade and customs bill supporting continued membership.– Guardian News and Media 2018Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Some people running 7 miles between drink stations. Runners going into shops on route to buy drinks.

some 90 tonnes - was transported to Frankfurt, while just over 1,200 tonnes remain in New York and around 430 in London as safeguards to buy foreign cash in case of a currency crisis.A 12.630 gram gold bar, the third one owned by Deutsche BundesbankThe bullion is now kept in a secret location in the bank\u0027s basement in Frankfurt, guarded around the clock by the German federal police.Germany’s riches were earned after World War Two, when exports surged resulting in large trade surpluses with other nations.These surpluses were converted into gold under the Bretton Woods system.The German affinity for gold is in part a vestige of the hyperinflation which rocked the Weimar Republic in the 1920s.Germans are still known for being conservative with their money, steering clear of taking on debt and preferring to pay with cash rather than plastic.Bank of EnglandPlease review our commenting policyFast food outlets should be banned from opening near schools to tackle obesity epidemic, say doctors\u0026#39Young\u0026#39 MI5 analysts need experience of policeman on street, former terrorism reviewer says Elderly and disabled at risk in inadequate housing, human rights watchdog findsSorry I told the world you love George Formby, Your Majesty, biographer jokesRunners brave hottest ever marathon, complete with detours to local pubs and shops to stay hydratedTom Daley reveals the difficulties of having a child via surrogate in the UKEmmanuel Macron, the \u0026#39Trump Whisperer\u0026#39, says there is no Plan B on Iran as he travels to WashingtonMajor police review recommends dropping policy of automatically believing \u0026#39victims\u0026#39Four Britons have been killed in a coach crash in Saudi ArabiaIsrael dismisses claims that Mossad killed Palestinian activist in MalaysiaIran pledges to destroy Israel within 25 years as tensions riseBishop George Bell investigation dropped by Sussex Police Police join beekeepers in battle against swarms buzzing into townNicaraguan journalist shot dead on Facebook Live as Pope calls for end of deadly protestsWestworld recap: the story so far, ahead of season 2McDolus vs McDonald\u0026#39s: French mayor launches fresh broadside in fast food war that has split island townDonald Trump says North Korea crisis is \u0026#39long way from conclusion\u0026#39Andrea Nahles wins SPD leader contest but could be a tricky ally for embattled Angela MerkelCyberbullying makes young people twice as likely to self harm or attempt suicide Nigeria\u0026#39s \u0026#39Oliver Twist\u0026#39 pupils at risk of Islamist recruitersWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/22/TELEMMGLPICT000161116546_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1qK9fS0WD7QU0EDCDdqwlh8X6iOpiIWEItn7dHA-Jwo.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sorry told world love george formby majesty biographer jokes","story":"The Queen and Prince Charles on stage at the Royal Albert HallA Royal biographer has spoken of his regret about revealing the Queen’s love of George Formby to the world, saying she now is doomed to hear ukulele music wherever she goes.Gyles Brandreth, a friend of the Royal Family who has written extensively on the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, said Formby’s songs had become the “go-to repertoire” for anyone hoping to entertain the Queen.Writing after a Royal Albert Hall concert to celebrate the Queen’s 92nd birthday, which saw the George Formby Fan Club play When I’m Cleaning Windows led by Frank Skinner, Harry Hill and Ed Balls, he said he must accept responsibility for the choice.“I\u0027m sure the Queen does enjoy George Formby, but I am not sure he\u0027s her \u0027one and only\u0027,” Brandreth said.“That will make no difference.  “Once it\u0027s in print there\u0027s no escape. From now on in, whenever the Queen and music are mentioned together, George Formby will  be part of the story.Ed Balls, Frank Skinner and Harry Hill perform a George Formby hit “She will have ukulele music wherever she goes.”The birthday concert was attended by the Queen, Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, Duke of Cambridge, Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, the Duke of York, Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie, the Earl and Countess of Wessex, the Princess Royal and Sir Timothy Laurence, along with other members of the extended Royal Family.Performers, intended to celebrate the Commonwealth, included Sir Tom Jones, Kylie Minogue, Shawn Mendes, Sting and Shaggy, with many viewers moved to wonder whether they were necessarily to the Queen’s own taste.Gyles Brandreth, the writerSome viewers had proclaimed themselves confused over the lack of National Anthem, with concert-goers instead giving the Queen a prolonged standing ovation as she took her seat at the Royal Albert Hall.Where they expected to hear a rendition of God Save the Queen, they were instead treated to a country song from Kylie Minogue, accompanied by dancing cowboys.One, tweeting his thoughts as the show was broadcast, said he was “disgusted”, while another said it was a “disgrace”.The Queen on her 92nd birthdayOrganisers said the decision not to play God Save the Queen was not an oversight or a slight, but a deliberate decision designed to create a party atmosphere.Royal sources said the evening was recognised as an “informal occasion”, while those working on the show for the BBC insisted they have been assured the anthem was not a “requirement”.Michael Lake CBE, director of the 150-year-old Royal Commonwealth Society which worked to put the event together in honour of its patron the Queen, said the concert was “meant to have the feel of a \u0027family \u0027 birthday party”, with a view being taken that the anthem “did not fit with that sensitivity”.Adding that the Queen appearing on stage to rapturous spontaneous applause from the audience had a “good feel” to it, he assured admirers of Her Majesty that it was “certainly not an oversight or a slight of any kind” but a “sensible course of action”.The Queen, who appeared delighted with her reception at the Royal Albert Hall, amused viewers who watched the broadcast on television by appearing to roll her eyes good-naturedly during a tribute from the Prince of Wales, who called her “mummy”.Please review our commenting policyFast food outlets should be banned from opening near schools to tackle obesity

years divided power sharing brexit united","story":"With power sharing on life support and Brexit threatening everything, Irish unity is on the agenda like never before –\u0026nbspbut the art of compromise must be rediscovered first\u0026nbsp“Wait and see what happens,” a family friend told me recently, “but why would you stay here when things are like this?” It’s a depressingly familiar refrain often heard by people like me who came of age in a post-conflict Northern Ireland, but have seen little reconciliation since. Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths.

Unfortunately, there was not nearly enough supply for the legions of fans who arrived at restaurants, police being called to some as outrage spread.Speaking to Vulture about the whole fiasco, co-creator Dan Harmon spoke about not receiving any notice from McDonald’s about the promotion and the show’s fans.TV preview 2018: Everything to look out forTV preview 2018: Everything to look out forStart date: 23 April, AMC on BT TV“It’s weird to get mugged by McDonald’s. It’s kind of an honour,” he told the publication of McDonald’s lack of communication with the Rick and Morty team.Commenting on the fan response, Harmon said: “I wouldn’t wish that show’s fans on any fast-food restaurant. I think everybody got what they deserved all around.”McDonald’s later apologised to fans for not producing enough sauce, releasing a further 20 million packets, as well as a podcast named The Sauce. Unfortunately, the flavour of the sauce was not well received by fans.Rick and Mortyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the people Dr Ilardo met told her he once stayed underwater for 13 minutes while hunting.Bajau \u0027sea nomads\u0027 of IndonesiaBajau \u0027sea nomads\u0027 of IndonesiaThe Bajau village of Jaya BaktiJaya Bakti homes from the waterA Bajau villager demonstrates the use of traditional wooden gogglesA young Bajau girl looks on in excitement as her father, a traditional Bajau er, returns to Jaya Bakti from a two-week fishing tripA small, unnamed island serves as a haven for visiting Bajau houseboats.\u0026#13The population was interested in learning about their genetic heritage, and Dr Ilardo used a portable ultrasound machine to measure spleen size in 59 Bajau.She then measured spleen size in 34 people from a neighbouring village inhabited by non- Bajau people so she could make a comparison.When she took her data back to Denmark to analyse, Dr Ilardo found Bajau people had spleens around 50 per cent larger than their neighbours. Spleens are involved in the so-called “human e response”. When a body is submerged in cold water the heart rate slows, blood vessels in the extremities shrink and the spleen contracts.This contraction injects a spurt of additional oxygen-rich blood cells into circulation, allowing the body to survive for longer underwater. Dr Ilardo and her collaborators estimated the enlarged spleens of the Bajau could provide them with around 10 per cent more blood cells than someone with a normal-sized spleen.Humans ‘evolving gene’ that may stop us drinking alcoholAs well as measuring spleen size, Dr Ilardo took spit samples from the study participants so she could investigate the genetic basis for the differences she was seeing. She identified several genes that were observed far more frequently in the genomes of Bajau participants, including one – PDE10A – that is involved with the production of thyroid hormone, which in turn is associated with spleen size.We believe that in the Bajau they have an adaptation that increases thyroid hormone levels and therefore increases their spleen size, said Dr Ilardo. It\u0027s been shown in mice that thyroid hormones and spleen size are connected. “If you genetically alter mice to have an absence of the thyroid hormone T4, their spleen size is drastically reduced, but this effect is actually reversible with an injection of T4.\u0027Unprecedented\u0027 7,000-year-old Native American burial site discovered by amateur er off coast off FloridaThis is the first adaptation for ing ever observed in humans. Previous work appeared to show that sea nomad children had superior underwater eyesight, but those results have since been disproved.The findings were published in the journal Cell. Despite initially warning Dr Ilardo against undertaking the work due to the likelihood she would find no significant results, her supervisors Professor Eske Willerslev and Professor Rasmus Nielsen think her findings are significant for a number of reasons.This is the first time that we really have a system like that in humans to study, said Dr Nielsen. “Nature has made experiments for us that tell us how humans react and adapt genetically to a whole new set of physiological conditions, so that we can explore and learn much more about the interaction between genetics and physiology.Mutant gene in Amish makes them live 10 years longerUnderstanding the genetics underpinning the Bajau’s abilities could even have applications in medical research – specifically for those trying to treat the condition of acute hypoxia, when body tissue experiences a rapid depletion of oxygen.There is also a fundamental need to understand the ersity of genes found in the world’s indigenous populations, said Professor Willerslev.This really tells us how valuable and important indigenous populations are around the world that are living extreme lifestyles, in terms of understanding the function of various genetic traits and finding the underlying genetic background for various physiological traits, he said. Most of these populations are completely understudied, and I think there is a huge benefit, not only potentially to them, but also to the rest of mankind by actually paying some attention to them.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She had been staging a sit-in protest with fellow detainees when her unit officer tapped her on the shoulder and said they needed to have a chat. She asked if it could wait until later, but was told it would only take 10 minutes.This was far from the truth. Over the next 12 hours, she and her mother Florence were strapped in waist restraint belts, placed in two separate vans and – chaperoned by a dozen officers – driven to Heathrow to be forcibly removed from Britain– the country Opelo has lived in since the age of 13.“I went down to reception and she sat me in a little room,” the 27-year-old told The Independent. “Then another manager came in and she put on a pair of latex gloves. As soon as she came in with those on I knew what was happening.Woman brought to UK from Botswana as a child in deportation reprieveYarl\u0027s Wood: Inside the crisis-hit immigration detention centreThe attempt to deport Opelo Kgari shows how unjust our system isGovernment thwarted in new bid to deport woman brought to UK as child“I couldn’t believe my unit manager had brought me there under false pretences. Just a few days ago we had sat together and talked about how we could improve the unit, and she was saying she’d do everything she can to make things better. “And then a few days later she’s been really sly and brought me into the situation the way she did. I felt so betrayed and angry.”Opelo was searched and told she could make one phone call before she had to hand over her mobile phone. With fight still in her at this point, she refused, arguing that as she was still in the centre she still had the right to have her possessions. But when she saw her mum brought through the door, she realised she had to make that phone call as soon as possible.“I realised at that point that it’s absolutely pointless trying to argue with these people, and that the sooner I call my solicitor the better. I was only allowed to phone one number, so he was the only person I could call,” she says. “I tried to argue the fact that my case is far bigger than just my solicitor. There are so many other people involved who can help me. But they said my solicitor was the only person who could help me. And that was the last time I could call anyone.”Opelo informed their solicitor as to what was happening. Shortly after the phone call, the “removal team” arrived: a group of 12 officers employed by Tascor, a Capita-owned company contracted by the Home Office to escort detainees to charter flights. Opelo found herself being searched again, this time more stringently.“We had our shoes taken off and we were searched right down to our socks,” she said, her voice breaks. She pauses as she tries to hold back the tears. “I find I can deal with a lot of it as best I can, but when I get searched – especially in the way that they did – it makes me feel so so small, and almost like a criminal, like I’ve done something really wrong. “I broke down when she was searching me. She stripped me of the last bit of dignity that I thought I had.”As this was happening, Opelo saw that their possessions were being loaded into the vans: “Officers had gone into our rooms and started chucking all our clothes and belongings into laundry bags. I recognised my gym bag and realised it was all of our stuff. It’s really hard to deal with and figure out how best to cope with it except just go with it until it’s over.”Government thwarted in new bid to deport woman brought to UK as childAs she was wearing just a pair of leggings and a top, Opelo was told she could change into jeans, but two officers were required to go into the toilet with her. They turned their backs to her, but she wasn’t allowed to close the door.Opelo and her mother were then “bound” in restraint belts, which Tascor has the right to use following an “inidual risk assessment”. Official Home Office guidelines state: “It may be decided that the use of a waist restraint belt provides the most effective method of managing a safe escort”.Despite not trying to physically resist the removal, the women were placed in the “restricted” restraint belt, which meant their wrists were strapped to the waist belt, limiting their arm movement.“They’re made of seatbelt material, but much thicker,” Opelo recalls. “They put it around you and on your wrists, so you can’t really move, you’re literally bound. I couldn’t move my arms more than 30cm from my body. And it has handles on either side on your ribs so that the officers can physically move you if say you didn’t want to walk. So they can pull you along.”At this stage, Opelo breaks down in tears.“I was already stripped of all dignity, so you just kind of go with it. But you just feel… like you’re not even a person anymore. They don’t even treat you like a person, it’s like you don’t matter to anyone. And the whole time my mum was saying that’s my baby, don’t treat her like that.”She and Florence were led into two separate vans, accompanied by six officers in each. As far as Opelo knew, the next time she would see her mum could be on a flight bound for a country she hardly remembers, away from everything she knows.Women in Yarl\u0027s Wood go on hunger strike over \u0027inhumane\u0027 conditionsOpelo – who throughout her time at Yarl’s Wood has tried to maintain a friendly rapport with the officers there, blaming the Home Office for her situation rather than them – is sympathetic towards the staff removing her, explaining that they “tried” to have conversations with her in the van.“They really did try, but I had mentally shut down by this point” she says. “Bless the woman sat next to me. She was so, so lovely. But I just couldn’t find it in myself to try. I think a lot of it stemmed from the way we were treated while we were still in Yarl’s Wood and handed over to them.”The vans arrived to the outskirts of London ahead of schedule, six hours before the flight was due to leave, so the removal team decided to park outside one of Tascor’s offices situated close to Heathrow until the time was more appropriate to go to the airport.“They parked the vans across from each other so they could all come out and talk to each other, but they had to remain in the van,” Opelo remembers. “We were there for a few hours just waiting. I had to stay in the van, separate from my mum.”Throughout the process, Opelo and Florence’s solicitors had been desperately trying to get an injunction from the courts to halt the removal. Three hours before the flight, Florence received a call saying they had succeeded. They would not be removed that day.“It was really good news, but they said that until the Home Office confirms they had to continue with the operation and take them onto security. Even though the judge had made a decision, they still had to wait on the Home Office,” says Opelo.“But it felt like a massive cloud had just shifted, the mood shifted, the officers relaxed a little bit. They said it was such good news they took the belt off me. They were really pleased that we didn’t have to go through with it.”Yarl\u0027s Wood: Inside the crisis-hit immigration detention centreAn hour later, the officers got confirmation of the injunction from the Home Office, and set off back to Yarl’s Wood, the women still in different vans. Due to bad traffic, they didn’t get back until around 10pm, and  then had to wait in reception for two hours.“We had literally left earlier in the day so I thought they should still have everything in place. But we sat and sat and sat. They had a TV so I put Made in Chelsea on – the most mindless show. I watched that and two other shows. Three other people coming in that night. After two and a half hours we got to go to our rooms,” says Opelo.“They had to search everything again. The whole process took another 40 minutes again. So we didn’t get back into our rooms until about 1am. I imagine a lot of money was wasted.”Since The Independent previously spoke to Opelo in February, at which point she had been in Yarl’s Wood for five weeks, there is a notable change in her demeanour. She maintains her ease of communication and is even able to laugh at times, but following the deportation attempt – the second she has been subjected to within a matter of weeks – the optimism and energy she had before has petered away.  “It’s because I don’t have much to smile about. It’s really difficult now to find something to smile about. You have to find joy somewhere, but the situation just gets harder and harder. I sometimes feel like I can’t carry on.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesTeam England Athletes during the Commonwealth Games Team England Parade in Victoria Square, Birmingham.Varun Chopra of Essex during the Specsavers County Championship Division One match between Essex and Lancashire at the Chelmsford County Cricket Ground.

The widespread public backing for her to remain in Britain is a source of hope, but regardless of her fate, what she has been through is likely to stay with her for years to come.“I’m trying to keep it together. I’ve decided not to see the psychiatrist in the centre because there’s only one and other people in here who need it much more than me, she says. “But I\u0027m pretty certain that when I come out I\u0027ll need to see a well-trained professional to go over the last few months of what I’ve been through. It’s extremely naïve to think it won’t affect me.“Being here is just mental torture, and the Home Office does this so they can tire you out and wear you out. It’s not okay to put people through this. No one should ever have to go through anything in this proximity.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Earlier this month, the court issued an injunction against the removal of Florence and Opelo Kgari although their immigration status remains unchanged. We have noted the injunction and are carefully considering its implications.”They said that they monitor the use of restraint by custody officers closely to ensure that the use of restraint is reasonable, necessary and proportionate, and operate a comprehensive complaints system if detainees feel that they have not been treated in accordance with Home Office standards.Asylum and Immigrationor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In essence, there is a concern that some voters will be disenfranchised as a result of restrictive identification requirements,” writes Claire Collier, the commission\u0027s legal secretary.The intervention comes after a slew of stories this week about members of the Windrush generation facing problems with access to healthcare and other state services.Many immigrants who arrived from the Caribbean between the late Forties and Seventies have no record of their legal status.Responding to the letter, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the newspaper: “It is the same hostile environment all over again, shutting our fellow citizens out of public life, treating communities who made Britain their home as second-class citizens. It’s disgraceful and it must be brought to an end.”The new electoral rules are set to be tried for the first time in five local authority areas – Bromley, Gosport, Swindon, Watford and Woking – during this year’s local elections on 3 May. If a success, they will be rolled out nationally from 2020.Although they are being implemented in response to perceived increase in voter identity fraud, figures previously reported by The Independent suggest the risk of such crime is minimal.A study by the Electoral Commission found just 28 allegations of someone having lied about their identity at a polling station in 2017, despite almost 45 million votes having been cast.Only one of these allegations resulted in a conviction.

It would also have serious repercussions for importers of UK products in the EU and the rest of the world.”The committee warned that if the UK tried to lower or remove tariffs on imports after Brexit, the consequences for British farming could be “extremely serious” while the impact on prices in the shops was likely to be “very limited”.It said that Britain should remain “as close as possible” to EU regulations, warning that UK consumers “would not tolerate any lowering of standards”. It also urged the government to seek a deal on immigration to allow the industry continued access to EU labour – both skilled and unskilled – on which it is heavily reliant.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Parliament can, if it chooses, let the people have their say on the deal, and with public support for a People’s Vote growing by the day, that’s exactly what parliament should do.”Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the Green Party and a backer of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign, said that “many MPs from across the political ide” would wish to amend the motion.“It’s now down to parliament to flex its muscles on this issue, and give people a say on this monumentally important decision,” she said.Mr Baker’s admission came in evidence to a Lords committee investigating the nature of the so-called “meaningful vote” on the final deal, which will take place later this year, or early in 2019.The prime minister, and other ministers, have repeatedly insisted that while MPs can reject the agreement reached with the EU, that would simply mean the UK crashing out with no deal at all.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union.

The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13But Mr Baker, when asked if the motion “would be amendable”, told peers: “I believe the position is that parliament can always seek to amend motions.”The minister was then asked specifically what would happen if an amendment requiring a fresh referendum was carried, replying: “That would be an extremely controversial situation, of course.”Mr Baker acknowledged such an amendment could not be ignored, adding: “We would be in the position where we would have to look extremely carefully at what the amendment precisely was.”And he held open the possibility of attempts to change the nature of the deal – which, if successful, would send the prime minister back to the negotiating table, it has been argued.“Clearly, the range of amendments that is possible is within the bounds of the imagination of all members of parliament,” the minister said.Speaking to the Lords constitution committee on Wednesday, Mr Baker suggested parliament had a duty to respect the referendum result and not to “frustrate that process”.UK wants the EU to protect its products from imitation after BrexitWindrush wasn’t an anomaly – and it has implications for BrexitLiam Fox ‘underestimating’ difficulty of getting farming trade deals“We will leave, there will not be attempts to stay in by the back door, there will not be an attempt to reverse the result,” he insisted – but he admitted it was “a political point, rather than a constitutional point”.Ms May has firmly rejected a further referendum, but some pro-EU Tories believe she could yet accept one if it appears the only way to keep her warring party together on Europe.Similarly, although Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour does not back another referendum, he has left the door open to a change of mind.There is also evidence that support is growing for a referendum on the Brexit deal, amid continuing confusion about both the planned transition period and the final agreement with the EU.A recent poll for Best for Britain found that 44 per cent of people want a vote – a clear eight points ahead of the 36 per cent who reject a further referendum.Opinion appears to be shifting as the negotiations remain bogged down on how to avoid a hard border in Ireland and with the details of a future trade deal unlikely to even be discussed until after departure day.Strikingly, last month David Davis predicted that parliament would vote down the deal unless the trade terms were broadly agreed – but the EU has insisted there is no time before its autumn deadline.The constitution committee was told the vote would take place “as soon as possible” after an expected autumn agreement in Brussels, and that it should be supported “in the national interest”.If parliament backs that motion, it will be followed by a Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill (Waib) to put the agreement into legal effect.Some MPs believe the “meaningful vote”, secured in a revolt last December, should take place on the bill, rather than the motion, only then passing the regulations necessary to deliver Brexit.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Debris shattered a passenger window, which in turn led to decompression.The authority fears the same problem could happen to other aircraft with the same engine model, and have ordered for almost 700 planes to be inspected, about half of which are in the US.Why you should still fly Southwest AirlinesSecond Southwest airlines flight forced to make emergency landingRyanair is the world\u0027s safest airline after Southwest tragedyIn an Emergency Airworthiness Directive, the FAA said: “Fan blade failure due to cracking, if not addressed, could result in an engine in-flight shutdown (IFSD), uncontained release of debris, damage to the engine, damage to the airplane, and possible airplane decompression.”It added that “the unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design”.The Southwest flight in question was on a Boeing Model 737-700 airplane powered by CFM56-7B model engines.The FAA has now ordered for all engines of this type with more than 30,000 total cycles to be inspected within 20 days.  Evaluating what went wrong aboard the ill-fated Southwest flight, the investigators said the failure led to “the engine inlet cowl disintegrating” and debris penetrating the fuselage “causing a loss of pressurization and prompting an emergency descent.”Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 had 149 people aboard when it made an emergency landing in Philadelphia.Oxygen masks descended as the passengers endured a terrifying rapid descent. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSouth Koreans cheer during the welcoming event for the inter-Korean summit between South Korea and North Korea in Seoul.

He said his act was inspired by a discussion he had at a conference that raised the issue of lower caste communities being denied entry to temples. He said he told students about a well-known legend in which a priest carried a Dalit devotee into a temple. When they expressed scepticism that a Hindu priest would do such a thing, he decided to do it himself.Inside Story - How to address Dalits plight?There is a lot of discrimination against Dalits but this stems from society, not from religious scriptures, Mr Aditya told the BBC. I hope others do the same - it doesn\u0027t mean everyone should literally carry a Dalit man on their shoulders. But they must welcome Dalits into temples and to participate in rituals, he added.Mr Rangarajan said other priests told him they would now do the same in their own temples . World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSouth Koreans cheer during the welcoming event for the inter-Korean summit between South Korea and North Korea in Seoul.

Some consumers wondered whether the French meat industry was feeling threatened by the rise in popularity of vegan food others doubted that consumers would ever be confused.One said: This is ridiculous. I can tell you now no carnivore has ever bought veggie sausages or Quorn thinking they were buying meat.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSouth Koreans cheer during the welcoming event for the inter-Korean summit between South Korea and North Korea in Seoul.

The Kremlin isn’t ready to do it just yet –\u0026nbspbut that doesn’t mean they won’t break the\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbsptryingOn Friday 13 April, inside a cramped Moscow courtroom, judge Yulia Smolina made Russian internet history. It took her just 19 minutes to agree to a government request to block the popular messaging app Telegram. The brutal efficiency of the decision – which took hold even before an appeal took place – suggested everyone thought implementation would be easy. Communications regulator Roskomnadzor began implementing the ban last Monday, ordering internet providers to block access to the messaging app. A game of hide and seek ensued. As soon as the first subnets were blocked, Telegram switched its servers to alternate IP addresses. Regulators responded by blocking entire internet subsets – to general calamity. By midday on 19 April, it had banned a total of 18 million IP addresses (compare this to 38,000 in all previous years).Importing apple trees instead of apples, Russia secures foodMany businesses, including parts of the banking infrastructure, were caught in Roskomnadzor’s net. On Sunday, Gmail and some other Google services went offline for many Russians, as the authorities shut down major networks they believed were being used to circumvent the ban.Telegram, meanwhile, remained accessible to the vast majority of Russian users. The Kremlin faced an embarrassing reality that the internet was stronger than its heaviest fist. But for many, the fear is that sharper impacts will now follow. Once a largely free space, the Russian internet has been increasingly subjected to regulation and censorship. The first blocklists appeared in 2012. Now, the decision of a remote Siberian village court is enough for a site to be struck off completely. Such, for example, was the fate that befell the country’s leading LGBT website, gay.ru, earlier this year – and any number of dating and porn sites the year before. Russia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsKremlin threatens to expel all UK media if Britain shuts down RTRepublicans say they found ‘no evidence’ Trump conspired with RussiaInstragram ‘removed photos of Kremin leader with escorts aboard yacht’In 2015, a new law was passed forcing foreign tech companies to move Russian data to servers inside Russia. Most refused to comply, but that may change. Kremlin hardliners have meanwhile made little secret of ongoing work to build an analogue to the Great Chinese Firewall. The Chinese model is now one of three scenarios under consideration, said independent observer Konstantin Gaaze. The first is to continue as if nothing has happened. Russia could certainly continue its haphazard approach of blocking subsets and IP addresses. But if it is to appear remotely effective, it will need the agreement of Apple and Google – for example, to block the notifications the app is using to update users on new server addresses. In 2016, the tech giants did cooperate with the Kremlin to remove the much less popular LinkedIn platform from its stores, but it is unclear if they will do so in these more controversial circumstances. On the other hand, Russia could choose to revisit and fudge the original court decision. Or it could take a sledgehammer to the internet with a system of filters and whitelists. “The security council met on Thursday, and it appears no major decision has been taken,” Mr Gaaze told The Independent. “Things are likely to continue as they are until the inauguration in May – then it is anyone’s guess”Others are less sure that Russia can make a firewall work. “It isn’t workable right now, as we don’t have the technology to deal with the data involved,” said Andrei Soldatov, author of The Red Web. China has been ready to lend a hand to the Kremlin, the security expert told The Independent, but the “paranoia” of Russia’s security services has prevailed.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSouth Koreans cheer during the welcoming event for the inter-Korean summit between South Korea and North Korea in Seoul.

The unexpected resistance of Telegram may change that. “The severity of Russia’s legislation has always been compensated by the lack of enforcement – that was the old adage,” said IT entrepreneur David Homak. “Telegram may not yet be blocked, but the Kremlin has shown it is ready for a battle, demonstrating strength in the most primitive sense .” In an interview with Izvestia, Roskomnadzor’s chief Alexander Zharov appeared to be clearing the way for a renewed assault on those tech companies refusing to move their data to Russia. “We will finish our compliance checks by the end of this year,” he told the pro-Kremlin newspaper. “If nothing happens … then obviously the question of blocking arises.”For Mr Soldatov, last week’s technical failure might be interpreted as political success. “After a week or two of this, the Kremlin might come to a view that it’s taken all the heat its possible to muster,” he said. “At that point, nothing is stopping it moving against Facebook”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?
