Bristol city council as he tries to wrest a Renoir painting from them and return it to its original owners.In an exclusive interview with MailOnline at his home in Amsterdam, he describes in detail his methods which have seen him succeed where the authorities have failed.    Earlier this year Mr Brand, who says he\u0027s more like Inspector Clouseau, uncovered a 1,600 year old stolen Cypriot St Mark mosaic, worth £10m, which was by then owned by a British coupleHis techniques are unorthodox, low key and increasingly successful, making him constantly in demand around the world.He is a patient man and spends years at a time searching for a single piece of art, criss-crossing the world in relentless pursuit of his target.When a piece of art is stolen, it invariably changes hands on the black market and the police investigate.After a period of about two years - once the police investigation has inevitably failed to infiltrate this criminal underworld - Arthur gets involved.          Among his greatest finds are two bronze horse sculptures hidden by Hitler and  and countless Renoirs, Picassos or Van Goghs\u0027I ask around and eventually I\u0027ll call someone and say that I hear they have a stolen Picasso or Van Gogh or a de Lempicka or whatever it is in their possession,\u0027 he says.\u0027They say that they have no idea what I\u0027m talking about and put the phone down. Then I\u0027m on to something. Three days later they always call back.\u0027They say that they had nothing to do with the original theft, but now they\u0027re stuck with this often priceless artwork because they can\u0027t hand it in or give it back, for fear of the criminals they\u0027d traded with or for fear of investigation themselves.\u0027So they trust me to return the artwork and protect everyone\u0027s privacy. I always stay within the law. And as long as no one gets hurt in the process, everyone\u0027s happy.\u0027Reflecting on his success, he tells MailOnline: \u0027Everyone thinks I\u0027m like Indiana Jones. But I\u0027m more like Inspector Clouseau!\u0027On the surface I\u0027m a private detective who cracks the world\u0027s biggest art cases like uncovering Hitler\u0027s Horses, but really I\u0027m the biggest idiot in the world who always follows the wrong lead and suspects the wrong person, before I finally crack it.\u0027I generally solve 80 per cent of my cases or I\u0027m still working on them now.\u0027The art world is just people lying and cheating to make money. But I\u0027m only interested in returning art to its natural home so that it can be enjoyed for future generations.\u0027I work with all kinds of art dealers, criminals, coppers, Nazis and Jews. I\u0027ll hassle people until they talk to me, but I\u0027m always honest and I keep people\u0027s confidences so they know that they\u0027re better off dealing with me than anyone else.\u0027All the wealthy art elite laugh at me because I\u0027m just a simple guy who travels everywhere by bus, sometimes carrying priceless art, and I have a basic old mobile phone.\u0027But I can\u0027t be corrupted by anyone so that\u0027s why everyone trusts me.\u0027Mr Brand learnt his trade from Michel Van Rijn, the man said to be responsible for at least 90 per cent of global art crime before switching sides and working for London\u0027s Scotland Yard to expose the murky world of art fraud.  Mr Brand\u0027s techniques are unorthodox, low key and increasingly successful, making him constantly in demand around the world. He recovered this piece by Tamara de Lempicka (pictured) by criss-crossing the world in relentless pursuit of his targetHe initially became London-based Van Rijn\u0027s gopher – opening suspected parcel bombs sent to him and ringing his enemy, a fake coin trader, to insult him as instructed.But Mr Brand became hooked on his teacher\u0027s \u0027crazy\u0027 world.His first profile case came in 2006 when he helped reveal pieces of a suspected 1,700 year old Gospel of Judas secretly being sold on the black market.It enraged Christians because it offered the alternative theory that Jesus had asked his trusted friend Judas to be portrayed as betraying the Son of Christ, so that Jesus could be crucified as pre-ordained.But Mr Brand really hit the big time with the discovery of the two £3 million Joseph Thorak horse sculptures which were thought to have been destroyed.It was while watching a documentary about Hitler in 2014 that he realised Hitler\u0027s Horses had been moved from the steps of Berlin\u0027s Reich Chancellery in the last film ever recorded of Adolf Hitler before his suicide.This meant that the horses - which had held pride of place under Hitler\u0027s office balcony - couldn\u0027t have been destroyed in the bombing of Berlin at the end of World War Two as previously thought.That sent him on a worldwide, two-year hunt before he found the horses among a priceless art and military treasure trove in a Nazi\u0027s garage in Bad Duerkheim, south west Germany.After false starts, false tip-offs and exhaustive research, he identified a compound of Nazi homes in the Rhineland where police found the horses and two Gustav Klimt statues alongside a cache of Nazi tanks, rockets and weaponry.It has been called the most significant Nazi art haul – altogether priceless – since the end of the Second World War.\u0027I had turned established history for over 70 years on its head,\u0027 he said. \u0027Next year they\u0027ll be showing my discovery in Germany for the first time since the war and I\u0027ll finally get to see it all.\u0027This really is the most remarkable thing that I will ever do in my life.\u0027          Mr Brand hit the big time by discovering the two £3m Joseph Thorak horse sculptures which were on the steps of Berlin\u0027s Reich Chancellery and were thought to have been destroyed          Reflecting on his success, Mr Brand tells MailOnline: On the surface I\u0027m a private detective who cracks the world\u0027s biggest art cases, but really I\u0027m the biggest idiot in the world who always follows the wrong lead and suspects the wrong person, before I finally crack it\u0027Mr Brand hit another high this year alongside London antiquities trader William Veres when after a two-year search across Europe they uncovered the Cypriot, 1,600 year old St Mark mosaic - worth £10m and one of the last missing pieces of Byzantine art.It had been stolen from the country\u0027s Kanakaria Church in Nicosia after the 1974 Turkish invasion which ided Cyprus before ultimately ending up in the hands of an unsupecting British couple.They eventually handed it over to Mr Brand in the tax exile of Monaco so he could finally return it to the Cyrpiot embassy.\u0027This was another of the greatest moments of my life,\u0027 he says.\u0027This is truly one of the last outstanding pieces to be returned. It\u0027s incredible to think that this piece or art survived for so long. It\u0027s part of the Cypriot peoples\u0027 soul.\u0027All I got for that pretty much was some pieces of the mosaic, a medal and a certificate. People around me get rich, while I get certificates!\u0027But I don\u0027t care about making money, all I care about is having adventures, like Indiana Jones. That\u0027s what keeps me going.\u0027Now Mr Brand has set his lofty sights on a distinctly British target.As Nazi war spoils have gradually been returned from collectors all over the world, there is one British institution holding out - Bristol City Council.Renoir\u0027s The Coast of Cagnes was originally owned by Jakob and Rosa Oppenheimer of Magraf art dealers - until the Nazis banned them from being directors in 1933.It was then bought by an Austrian Jew who left it to Bristol Museum and Art Gallery on his death, who are refusing to accept it was a trophy of war.\u0027It\u0027s astonishing that art collectors all over the world have returned priceless artwork lost under Nazi-occupation – yet Bristol City Council stands alone in refusing to return this Renoir to the Oppenheimers, despite the family being forced out of their art dealership and their business eventually going under, we say, as a result.\u0027Now they\u0027ve hired me to set the record straight. I\u0027m going to make so much noise on this and I won\u0027t give up until that Renoir is back in the hands of the Oppenheimers where it belongs.\u0027I won\u0027t let Bristol council get away with this.\u0027The Spoliation Advisory Panel, which considers claims over cultural objects lost during the Nazi era but now held by UK museums and galleries, has rejected the claim and believes the Renoir was sold due to bank debt rather than persecution by Hitler\u0027s regime."},{"url":null,"title":"England rugby star Sam Burgesss messy split Aussie golden girl","story":"    South Sydney star footballer Sam Burgess leaves the home he shared with wife Phoebe in Sydney\u0027s south-east on Wednesday afternoon after their \u0027pretty messy\u0027 split emerged  NRL and England star Sam Burgess (pictured outside his marital home in Sydney on Wednesday) having split from his wife of three years Phoebe (together right)          Phoebe Burgess announced the December 9 birth of her second child William \u0027Billy\u0027 Burgess (pictured) - but they have since gone their separate ways          Did Joanna Burgess take a swipe at Phoebe Burgess on Christmas Day?

The Springwatch presenter suggested he run through Hampshire\u0027s New Forest pursued by hunting hounds and riders on horseback rather than them following a pre-laid scentHowever, the 250-year-old hunt group declined his offer, saying it would be impractical for their dogs.Labour outlawed hunting foxes with dogs in 2004, causing NFH and other hunts to turn to trail hunting in which hounds chase an artificial scent, but critics believe the sport can still result in hunts chasing a fox accidentally or deliberately.Mr Packham, 57, visited the hunt at Linwood, near Ringwood, Hampshire, on New Year\u0027s Day, to appeal to them to change and has now offered to be their first human quarry for the dogs to chase, if the group will switch to drag hunting.He said: \u0027Foxhunting is a highly emotive activity which has no place in the contemporary environment - and everyone knows that.Public school teachers are QUITTING at the highest rate on...The £8,500 SLAP on the bottom!

Cummings, a mercurial and intelligent strategist, stoking the fire of Brexit behind the scenes, with Gove, alongside Boris Johnson, as the public face of the official campaign me, doing all I can to dampen the flames and get people to focus elsewhere.Cumberbatch says he took the Cummings role because of James Graham’s script, but there is no doubt that the master strategist behind Brexit also provides a fascinating character for any actor.Witnessing him in action before the referendum campaign, it was clear Cummings was highly effective at being isive. It was he who characterised the educational establishment as ‘the blob’ and wound up anyone and everyone with his vicious, mischievous and — of course — anonymous outpourings on Twitter.At that time, he was clearly behind a series of briefings against David Cameron. So much so that he and Michael Gove were invited into Number 10 and asked if there was anything he wanted to get off his chest.Cummings, it turned out, wasn’t so willing to criticise the Prime Minister to his face, and my memory of the meeting was of him meekly praising Cameron. Afterwards we wondered where the reckless rebel of folklore had been. After all, this was someone who reportedly used to sign himself into Whitehall meetings under the name Osama bin Laden.At the time, my view of Cummings was summed up by quoting that scene from Monty Python’s Life Of Brian, ‘He’s not the Messiah, he’s just a naughty boy’. The line was changed in the TV version to, ‘He’s not the Messiah. He’s just a f****** a*****le’. So how accurate was the rest of the drama?          The charts the story of the clash of political campaigners, with Cummings directing the Leave campaign and Oliver directing the Remain sideFrom the moment the film was announced, critics of Brexit were worried that having an international superstar like Benedict Cumberbatch playing Cummings would give the man more credence than he deserved. They feared Cummings would be lionised, rather than held to account.At first, I worried too. Surely a star of Cumberbatch’s calibre would create sympathy for a man who should be confronted with tough questions.And the fact is that, having delivered the Brexit vote, Cummings disappeared in a puff of smoke. After setting the fire going, he steadfastly avoided media interviews — and refused to appear in front of a Parliamentary committee to answer difficult questions about data use and dodgy claims during his campaign.Most of my fears were allayed, however, when I visited the film set and saw that Cumberbatch was almost unrecognisable, having shaved his head to create Cummings’ unmistakably sparse thatch and bald forehead. He has not glamorised Cummings, just sort of inhabited him.The first half of James Graham’s sophisticated and thoughtful script is devoted to exploring Cummings, the Machiavellian guru who can connect with, and prey on, people’s fears.He is shown running rings around the likes of Brexiter Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, whose cack-handed attempt to get Cummings fired from the official Leave campaign blew up in his face.But if the first half of the film pays heed to Cummings’ undoubted intelligence, and can be seen as the case for his defence, the second is the case for the prosecution.Johnson and Gove are shown at one point looking perplexed and perturbed as Cummings dances manically in front of his notorious campaign red bus on which he had slapped the deeply misleading message: ‘We send the EU £350 million a week. Let’s fund our NHS instead. Vote Leave.’          James Graham, who wrote Brexit : The Uncivil War, said Cumberbatch wanted to play Dominic Cummings with ‘sympathy and understanding’At this point, the Remain campaign comes into sharp focus, trying to defend an unsatisfactory status quo and complex realities, from immigration to the European Court of Justice, in the face of simple claims that Utopia is just around the corner, if only we can leave the dastardly EU.It shows how Cummings sets about systematically and carelessly unleashing the demons of David Cameron’s nightmares.As for the scenes in which I am portrayed, I watched through splayed fingers, groaning as I saw that Rory Kinnear had captured my mannerisms and tics as I tried to have some time with my children while taking a conference call with David Cameron and Peter Mandelson.Kinnear also captured my sense of despair as I watched anti-Brexit campaigner Bob Geldof flicking V signs at Nigel Farage as they barracked each other during their notorious River Thames confrontation at Westminster, when rival pro-Remain and pro-Brexit flotillas clashed. ‘Is this what we’ve come to?’ I asked.The film shows how the murder of the kind, brave and thoughtful Labour MP Jo Cox stopped the campaign short. A moment to reflect about what things are really worth.I suspect how you judge Brexit: The Uncivil War will depend on whether you are Remain, Leave or simply uncertain. It’s extremely well written, acted, directed and produced.If I have one small criticism, it is that the film focuses too much on the exploitation of data as the reason Leave won, suggesting it was simply clinical brilliance that triumphed, rather than the cynical calculation of Cummings and his team, who were too willing to ride in the slipstream of Nigel Farage as he threw out raw, red meat to his supporters with exaggerated and irresponsible claims. It could also have done more to acknowledge that many of the 17.4 million who voted Leave did so out of anger at Brussels’ arrogance and the billions being paid to the EU.The drama is at its best when it shows Dominic Cummings as a master of disruption and destruction, who struggles to make things work long-term.More than two-and-a-half years after the EU referendum, we’re nowhere near the Brexit Utopia he and the Leave campaign promised.          Cummings, pictured here with Boris Johnson and Michael Gove ran the Vote Leave campaignAt the end of the TV version, Dominic and I meet for a drink. He tells me the hard truth that a new type of politics is coming, ‘One that you can’t control’.I ask him, ‘What’s your edge?’ What has he found to make things any better? He doesn’t have an answer.That meeting never happened. But writer James Graham invents it — legitimately in my view — as a means of summing up the clash of two very different world views: Me – believing the world is complex, muddy and requires compromise Cummings the absolutist who demands creative destruction.In that make-believe conversation, I make the case for ‘a kinder, gentler politics’ — and my fear that it has been lost. That’s exactly what I feel having been through the madness, bitterness and bloodshed of the referendum and its aftermath.I hope the film will serve as a warning that the political class needs to sober up - and focus more on what unites, than what ides us. Respect is due on both sides. And it is my belief that the only way through the current chaos is for Parliament to find a cross-party common ground that finally allows us to move on.As for me and Dominic, I’m more than happy to make that drink a reality. Talk it over. Make the peace – and help put out that fire once and for all.So how about it, Dominic? The drink’s on me.Brexit: The Uncivil War is on Channel 4 at 9pm on Monday, January 7."},{"url":null,"title":"Hatton Garden jewel thief freed time Christmas halfway sentence","story":"    John \u0027Kenny\u0027 Collins was spotted outside this Tesco after the ringleader was released The ringleader behind the infamous Hatton Garden jewellery heist has been spotted outside Tesco after being freed from prison in time for Christmas after serving half of his sentence.John \u0027Kenny\u0027 Collins, 78, spent the holidays at home, according to the Mirror, returning to the council house where he and the rest of his gang vied up the gems after the daring raid on the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd in 2015.Collins, who fell asleep while on lookout during the famous burglary, was released on licence from Belmarsh prison in South East London a month ago halfway through his seven-year sentence.His release means only one out of the four criminals responsible for the heist is still behind bars, despite millions of pounds worth of jewellery still being missing.Former Met Police chief Peter Kirkham said: \u0027We are talking about lots of victims. \u0027Some of them have lost everything, their ­livelihoods as jewellery dealers and some may not have been insured.\u0027It can destroy people\u0027s lives and the maximum sentence available to the judge was only 10 years.

The German parliament building was relatively new at the time, having opened in 1894 following the unification of the country in 1871. Located near the Brandenburg Gate, it was severely damaged by the 1933 fire that helped cement Hitler\u0027s power and by Allied bombing during World War II. Largely disused during the Cold War, it re-opened in 1999 with the glass dome designed by Norman Foster replacing the original dome pictured in the 19th-century image          Piccadilly Circus, London. The junction in central London looks familiar even in the older picture, with the Eros statue - put up in 1893 - in its original position in the centre of the circus. The horse-pulled traffic has since been replaced by cars and buses, and the Underground station opened in 1906 on what was then the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway           Piazza del Popolo (People\u0027s Square), Rome. The square is dominated by the Egyptian obelisk dedicated to Ramesses II, pharaoh of Egypt in ancient times. The monument was built in the 10th century and moved here in 1589. Behind the obelisk are the two Roman Catholic churches of Santa Maria dei Miracoli and Santa Maria in MontesantoArc de Triomphe, Paris. The French capital\u0027s most famous landmark aside from the Eiffel Tower, the Arc was commissioned by Napoleon in 1806 to celebrate his victories in Europe but political turmoil in France delayed its completion until 1836. The names of French victories and generals are inscribed in the monument. Since the earlier picture was taken it has also become a memorial to France\u0027s wars in the 20th century and an unknown warrior was buried underneath it in 1921    Westminster Abbey, London. A church has stood on the site since the 10th century but it took on its current status as a Royal Peculiar under Queen Elizabeth I in 1560. It houses graves and monuments to British luminaries across the centuries, including monarchs, politicians, poets and scientists, as well as the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior buried there in 1920          St Peter\u0027s Square, Vatican City. In this older view of the Holy See, St Peter\u0027s Basilica - the centrepiece of the Vatican under which the apostle of Jesus is held to be buried - is just visible on the left. Popes have resided in the Vatican for over a thousand years but the square with its arches and colonnades was built in the 17th-century. On the left is an obelisk brought from EgyptEiffel Tower, Paris. The landmark tower was a recent addition to the Paris skyline when this picture was taken. It was built in the 1880s ahead of a world\u0027s fair in Paris in 1889 which marked a century since the French Revolution. Named after designer Gustave Eiffel, it originally faced opposition from Parisians who compared it to a \u0027half-built factory pipe\u0027    Notre Dame, Paris. Work on the Catholic cathedral began in 1163 but it was not fully completed for almost two centuries, later serving as the venue for Napoleon\u0027s coronation after he became Emperor of the French in 1804. After World War II there were major efforts to clean the cathedral, returning it to its original lighter colour           Nicolaaskerk, Amsterdam. The Catholic church in the old town near Amsterdam\u0027s railway station was built in the 1880s and dominates that part of the Dutch capital\u0027s skyline.

The imposing railway station with its neo-Renaissance design was opened in 1889, serving the growing demand for rail transport in the Netherlands. It is now a huge transport hub with trains arriving directly from London after coming through the Channel Tunnel, and 250,000 people use the station every dayNational Museum, Prague. The museum with its domes and fountains was opened in 1891, and is located at the top of Wenceslas Square in the Czech capital. When the earlier picture was taken Prague was part of Bohemia which in turn belonged to Austria-Hungary. The building is still standing but it suffered severe damage during bombing in 1945 and again during the Prague Spring in 1968 when Soviet tanks were sent in to quell a rebellion against Moscow    Kungstradgarden, Stockholm. Meaning King\u0027s Garden, the park dates back to the 15th century and has become one of the landmarks of the Swedish capital. It was once the site of a mansion but it burned down in 1825, and half a century later the gardens opened to the public Colosseum, Rome. This ancient monument has changed relatively little since the older picture was taken. The amphitheatre was finished in the year AD 80 during the days of the Roman Empire, when up to 50,000 people would go to the stadium to watch battles and executions. The Pope holds a service there every Friday in memory of early Christians who died there    British Museum, London. The museum opened in 1753 and the bulk of the current building was opened in the 19th century, housing collections from through the centuries including treasured Anglo-Saxon items from the Sutton Hoo hoard and the Rosetta Stone which helped historians read ancient Egyptian hieroglyphicsPiazza Navona, Rome. This square was once the site of a stadium for 20,000 spectators to watch athletic competitions in Ancient Rome. Today is is dominated by fountains created during the reign of Pope Gregory XIII    Louvre, Paris. The area began life as a royal fortress for Kings of France in the 12th century in what was then an outer part of the city. In the 16th century it became the primary royal residence for French monarchs, before the revolution of 1789 eliminated the royal family and turned the site into a museum. The pyramid which is now one of the icons of the Louvre art gallery - home to the Mona Lisa - was added in the 1980s as one of the Grands Projets of French president Francois Mitterrand          General Art and Industrial Exposition of Stockholm. This picture from 1897 shows a world\u0027s fair which was held in the Swedish capital that year, lasting for some five months and showing off recent technologies such as X-rays and telephones           Prague Castle. When the picture was taken at the turn of the 20th century the castle was the residence of the last Kings of Bohemia before the kingdom was replaced by Czechoslovakia after the end of World War I. It is a huge complex of churches, palaces and other buildings, including the window from which Catholic officials were thrown in 1618 - the Defenestration of Prague - in an event which helped to spark the Thirty Years\u0027 War. Today it is the official seat of the Czech President          Palace of Westminster, London. The site was first a church in Anglo-Saxon times, becoming the \u0027West Minster\u0027 from which the area in central London gets its modern name. In the Middle Ages it became a royal palace and representatives from across England began meeting at Westminster when the first Parliaments began to meet in the 13th century. It became the regular seat of the House of Commons and Lords but the building was destroyed by fire in 1834, prompting the construction of the modern parliamentary building. The clock tower known as Big Ben was part of the rebuilding work London Bridge. The bridge named in the nursery rhyme London Bridge Is Falling Down has actually described a series of different river crossings over the centuries. The one pictured was opened in 1831 and at the turn of the century, around the time this picture was taken, it saw 8,000 pedestrians crossing every hour. That bridge was sold to an American buyer in 1967, who had it moved to Arizona, and replaced with the current overpass between Tower Bridge and Cannon Street rail bridge    Luxembourg Palace, Paris. This royal palace from the 17th century was one of the residences of French monarchs and became a prison in the French Revolution. Today it is the seat of the Senate, one of two national legislative assemblies in France           Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome. The church dates back to ancient times, originally built in the fourth century on the site of what had once been a pagan temple. Its name refers to the fact it is the largest of 26 churches in Rome which are dedicated to the Virgin Mary           State Opera, Berlin. This is a view of Unter den Linden, one of the city\u0027s main thoroughfares which runs from the Brandenburg Gate - which would later form part of the Wall during the Cold War - towards Alexanderplatz in East Berlin. The opera house, on the right, was founded in 1742. Out of shot to the right is a square, once called Opera Square, where the Nazis burned piles of books after coming to power in 1933.

You can call it the Schumer, or the Pelosi, or the Trump shutdown. Doesn\u0027t make any difference to me,\u0027 he told a reporter. \u0027Just words.\u0027 He also used the press conference to say that he had asked the Democrats if they would use the shutdown to impeach him.Schumer, Pelosi, their deputies and their Republican opposites had met with Trump at the White House for two hours of talks with Trump as the shutdown went on for a fourteenth day.Trump insisted that \u0027progress\u0027 was made — although he wouldn\u0027t say what it was — and that both sides were in agreement on reopening the government as quickly as possible.As Pelosi left the White House she told reporters the talks were \u0027sometimes contentious. Schumer echoed her comments. \u0027It is very hard to see how progress will be made unless the open up the government,\u0027 he said in brief remarks.Schumer said: \u0027We made a plea to the president once again: don\u0027t hold millions of Americans, hundreds of thousands of workers, hostage. Open up the government, and let\u0027s continue the discussions.\u0027 The Democrat said Trump indicated in the meeting that he was willing to ride the shutdown out.\u0027He said he would keep it closed for a very long period of time, months or even years,\u0027 Schumer added.There was no mention from the Democratic leaders of a possible deal floated by Pence, who had suggested that the president could use a program giving legal status to illegal immigrant children as an incentive for Democrats to give him is border wall.Pence said that Trump\u0027s stance heading into a Friday morning meeting with congressional leaders is \u0027no wall, no deal,\u0027 but he\u0027s willing to negotiate other aspects of an agreement to reopen the government.  \u0027I think the president’s made it very clear -- no wall, no deal,\u0027 he told Tucker Carlson after the Fox News host asked about the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. \u0027But look, we really are prepared to negotiate, we’re prepared to talk, we’re prepared to listen,\u0027 he added.Trump claimed at the presser once again that an appeals court squashed a DACA deal last year when it protected the program his administration axed. \u0027That\u0027s what broke up the DACA deal. Yes, we had a pathway, we had many things, that was getting close to being a deal,\u0027 he said. \u0027The problem was that the money was a very small amount of money.\u0027The president said that the $25 billion over 10 years that the legislation appropriated only provided $1 billion up front for his wall and he didn\u0027t want to have to go back to Congress and ask for the money each year. He signaled he wouldn\u0027t sign the bill he seemed to be referring to at the time because it provided a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrant children. He smacked it down as amnesty for illegals.          Vice President Mike Pence suggested that the president could use a program giving legal status to illegal immigrant children as an incentive for Democrats to give him is border wall          Pence said that Trump\u0027s stance heading into a Friday morning meeting with congressional leaders is \u0027no wall, no deal,\u0027 but he\u0027s willing to negotiate other aspects of an agreement to reopen the governmentPelosi has said that DACA alone is not enough for her caucus to give the president his border wall funding, anyway. He\u0027s asking for north of $5.6 billion at this point.  The president didn\u0027t say what he offered Democrats, or what they may have agreed to, as he took one last shot at getting the government back on track before the end of the current pay period.\u0027I don\u0027t want to get into that, because I don\u0027t want to put them in a position where they have to justify anything to a lot of the people they have to make happy.\u0027He used the response as an opportunity to say that the nation does not want children dying on the way up from Central America to the United States and traveling in caravans.Pelosi said Thursday that she\u0027d be willing to give the president a dollar for the wall to get the government back open, but she was only half-seriously responding to a reporter\u0027s question about the potential for an agreement.House Democrats passed bills providing no money for the wall last night that would fund the Department of Homeland Security for a little more than a month.The White House has said that Trump would not sign the legislation, and the Senate did not bother to put it on the floor. As leaders departed the Capitol for their meeting on the other side of town with Trump, the Senate adjourned until Tuesday morning, ensuring that the government shutdown would continue for at least three more days.    Trump meanwhile sent each Member of Congress a slideshow prepared Nielsen that the White House previously suggested was so sensitive that it could only be viewed in a classified setting.GOP leaders and the White House also complained that Pelosi and Schumer walked out of the Wednesday briefing early and rudely interrupted the president\u0027s Cabinet secretary.  The White House said in a Friday statement that Trump had sent the slideshow briefing to every member of Congress, as such.

He left without taking questions ten minutes later to the shock and dismay of assembled press.He made sure he had the last word on Friday, giving an impromptu press conference in the Rose Garden on an unseasonably warm winter day. The temperature was 50 degrees Fahrenheit in Washington during the remarks that Trump wore an overcoat to. His vice president, accompanying lawmakers and DHS secretary signaled toward the end that they were cold. Trump offered his jacket to a shivering Nielsen but she declined and rubbed her hands together, instead, as the president forged on with questions.He let House McCarthy and Scalise deliver remarks after Pence and had Nielsen take a question on terrorism. As they were leaving, Pence turned around to tell DailyMail.com that he\u0027d reject a pay raise coming to him as an unintentional effect of the shutdown.Democrats also spoke to press from the president\u0027s driveway, reiterating in their position that they will give him no money for the wall.The White House has repeatedly suggested that Pelsoi would loosen her grip on border wall funding once she was formally named speaker. Trump has repeatedly claimed that Democrats are refusing him to have a platform to run on in 2020.But the California Democrat has continued to be firm in her resolve that wall funding is not coming. \u0027We\u0027re not doing a wall,\u0027 Pelosi said Thursday after she\u0027d taken the gavel in the House. \u0027It has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with a wall is an immorality between countries. It\u0027s an old way of thinking.

But late author James Pope-Hennessy, who interviewed members of the Royal Family, former courtiers and ladies-in-waiting, omitted some of the juiciest — and funniest — material, knowing it would never get past the royal censors.Here, in this extract from his newly-published private jottings, is an extraordinarily detailed account of the few days he spent in 1957 with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor at the converted mill house they had just bought near Paris. It was 21 years since the Duke — Queen Mary’s eldest son — had, as Edward VIII, abdicated the throne in order to marry Wallis Simpson, a orced American socialite.At 12.30, I was at the Gare du Nord (in Paris), where the long blue station wagon (Cadillac) of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor was waiting, with a plump pigeon-shaped English chauffeur, dressed in discreet black with a black rosette in his cap.We drove out through jammed streets to Le Moulin de la Tuilerie, which the Duchess has converted into her Petit Trianon. The car hooted at the wooden door in the gatehouse, and this was opened. We drove to the front door where the liveried butler (French) and an English footman were waiting.I was directed to walk across the sunny courtyard to the French windows of the Duke’s study, a colossal room made from a barn, with great log fires smouldering either end, French windows in the middle, maps of his world tours on the walls, souvenirs and uniform buckles everywhere.

Welsh property developer, 35, lives...Share this article‘This room,’ the Duchess told me, ‘represents the Dook’s life.’The floor is covered with a curious tufted carpet in three shades of green, very fresh and pretty: ‘What a pretty carpet, Duchess I’ve never seen one like it before.’‘Ah call it mah lawn.’The Duke of Windsor is, on first sight, much less small than I had been led to believe he is not at all a manikin, but a well-proportioned human being. Just then his hair was blown out in tufts on either side of his head, and he was looking crumple-faced and wild.          The Duke and Duchess of Windsor standing on stone stepsHe has his father’s eyes, and some, I fancy, of his mannerisms. He was drinking milk for what the Duchess calls ‘that lil’ old ulcer’. I should say she is on the whole a stupid woman, with a small petty brain, immense goodwill and a stern power of concentration.Like her house, she is tremendously American, and specifically Southern — it was like being back in Montgomery, Alabama, without the tree moss.I should therefore be tempted to classify her simply as An American Woman par excellence, were it not for the suspicion that the Duchess is not a woman at all. She is one of the very oddest women I have ever seen.She is flat and angular, and could have been designed for a medieval playing card. The shoulders are small and high the head very, very large, almost monumental the expression is either anticipatory (signalling, ‘I know this is going to be loads of fun, don’t yew?’) or appreciative — the great gig-lamp smile, the wide, wide open eyes, which are so very large and pale and veined, the painted lips and the cannibal teeth.There is one further facial contortion, reserved for speaking of the Queen Mother, which is very unpleasant to behold, and seemed to me akin to frenzy.Her high smooth flat forehead is cloven by a deep vertical line of concentration. Her neck makes her age (61) apparent — a tendency to wattles. Her jawbone is alarming, and from the back you can plainly see it jutting beyond the neck on each side.          James Pope-Hennessy (pictured above) had interviewed many members of the royal household          The couple had visited the Bahamas in 1942 - the Duke of Windsor had served as the Governor there She is wildly good-natured and friendly but with both of them one somehow feels that so much enthusiasm might suddenly gel up and one would be in the limbo reserved for the many, many people who have treated them badly or turned out a disappointment. I like having my jokes laughed at but there’s no need to make the mill-beams rock with appreciation of them.The house itself is full of very pretty colours and ideas and objects. Every conceivable creature comfort is conscripted, to produce a perfection of sybaritic living. They are like people after a cataclysm or a revolution, valiantly making the best of infinite luxury.It is, of course, intensely American, but I would think consciously aimed. The Queen Mother at Clarence House is leading a lodging-house existence compared to this.  James Pope-Hennessy said the couple (pictured above) were not what he had expected them to beMy room in the stables was very pretty and convenient, and prepared or planned by a perfectionist there was nothing on earth that you might conceivably want that wasn’t there — every kind of writing paper, nail file, brush, fruit, ice-water the bathroom loaded with scent bottles like a counter at a bazaar.After pottering in my bedroom, I wandered up the hill past the millstream, attracted by a stream of German oaths. Round the corner of the house I found the Duke, wearing a cerise felt baseball cap. He was jumping about rather wildly, and shouting ‘Jawohl, Jawohl’ and other military German expressions to a troop of French gardeners who were lugging the stone base of a sundial on to its mount.The Duchess, flat against the inside of the drawing room window, was looking on in a disinterested angular way, one hand on the window pane.‘Are the gardeners German?’ I inquired. ‘Well, no — one is Alsatian and one is Spanish, and that lil’ boy is only 14.‘But as the Dook’s German is sort of better than his French, he likes to talk German with them.‘Now I hope you’ll get in your talk with the Dook this afternoon,’ she continued. ‘You must catch him but you’ll find the Dook is kind of a slow starter’ — said with a great wide smile.          The Duke and Duchess of Windsor, sitting in the drawing room of their Paris home, with their four Pug dogs at their feeAbout 3.30pm the Duke came in, sitting on the sofa opposite my chair to talk. The pugs gambolled about — Disraeli, Trooper and Davy Crockett.‘We did have a fourth, called Peter Townsend (the orced Battle of Britain pilot whom Princess Margaret had wanted to marry),’ the Duchess explained with her least nice grin. ‘But we gave the Group Captain away.’ The whole atmosphere was intensely unstrained and unshy, owing, I should say, to the Duchess and the job she has done on the Duke. He talked with complete freedom, even of the delicate subject to which he obliquely refers as ‘1936’.‘My mother (Queen Mary) loathed the country,’ he said. ‘She used to say to me: “I was born in Kensington and I am a Londoner.” She hated Sandringham Balmoral was a bit better but we were always there too long. Sandringham was dreadful.’He added: ‘Off the record, my father (George V) had a most horrible temper. He was foully rude to my mother.‘Why, I’ve often seen her leave the table because he was so rude to her, and we children would all follow her out not when the staff were present, of course, but when we were alone.’I remarked that I was puzzled by the shutting down of his mother’s high spirits after marriage.          King George V with the his Consort, Queen Mary pictured on a visit to Liverpool‘Well, you’re right there, I think. My father was a very repressive influence. I well remember when he used to go banging away for a week or two at some shoot in the Midlands we used to have the most lovely time with her alone — always laughing and joking.‘She was a different human being away from him.’He said suddenly: ‘You realise there are only three completely royal persons alive now? My sister, my brother and myself.’          The Dowager Queen Mary with her son Edward, who abdicated as King in order to marry Wallis Simpson, an American orceeTea was a serious, perfectionist meal, with the Duchess struggling manfully with the teapot (she evidently hates tea, and looks very out of place pouring it out but the Duke drinks, she assured me, cup after cup all day ‘He leaves haff the cup, too, so it gets cold,’ she added.When we got to the drawing room again, the Duchess settled herself on a low wide day-bed, her legs tucked up she does not curl up but somehow dismantles herself, so that she looks like a puppet lying in the wings of a toy theatre.Duchess: ‘We-e-ell, and has the Dook been much help?’          This photo taken in 1937 shows King George VI and Queen Elizabeth with Queen Mary and at the front their children Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret on the balcony at Buckingham Palace, after the Coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey‘Oh, a tremendous help, Duchess I can’t tell you.’Duchess: ‘He was pretty close to his mother, you know. I suppose you’ve had to see everybody about yah book?’ ‘Oh yes,’ I said. ‘The Duke’s sister has been very helpful, and the Queen Mother.’Duchess (in a slightly steely tone): ‘I don’t think the Queen Mother would know about Queen Mary.’ She went on: ‘Just everything happens to me. When I was over in England last, I wanted a new maid so I intervood one who told me she had been five years with the Queen Mother!‘Well, I brought her over here but I had to get rid of her.‘I had a Balenciaga dress with a crinoline. Well, Irene ironed that crinoline so that you couldn’t see what it was by the time she’d finished. I took it back, but even Mr Balenciaga himself couldn’t decide just what she had done to that crinoline.‘And she just burned up five more of my dresses. Well, that surprised me, because I thought that, after all those years with the Queen Mother, if she hadn’t learnt to iron a crinoline, what had she learned?’  Official portrait of Queen Mary (left) in 1935 and another from 1912 (right)‘And, you know, whenever I see pictures of those poor girls (Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret) with their suits all screwed up under the arms, I think of Irene. I’d like to take those girls’ clothes apart and loosen them up.’Before dinner, having had my bath and changed, I was standing by the fireplace in the hall, when the front door flew open and the Duke scampered in, making a yelping noise on seeing me he was wearing red trousers, a fur coat, and a peaked flying cap with fur ear-flaps. He was followed by the valet carrying some clothes.He dashed upstairs. When he came down again, very spick and  in a Balmoral tartan kilt, he smiled with great charm: ‘I say, you saw a pretty quaint apparition just now? Whatever did you think, I wonder? Why they put me into red pants I can’t imagine.’Presently, a tapping of high heels and the creak of stiff silk announced the Duchess, who wound her way down the staircase sheathed in a red-orange very tight, almost hobbled, dress. After dinner, the Duke lugged me off for a preliminary look at his papers, which were in a spare bedroom.A tall white tin filing cabinet, with five or six drawers, stood on a groundsheet at the foot of a green chintz bed. He unlocked it and we sat down side by side on the bed.‘There’s a lot of valuable stuff here, you know,’ he said. ‘Unlike the Duchess, I am very well documented. But I keep them all under years, not under people. Let’s take a look now at 1936.’          The Duke and Duchess of Windsor look lovingly at one another He seized one of the two 1936 files and showed me various letters — until we reached one from Queen Mary, begging him not to broadcast (his abdication speech).‘Surely you might spare yourself this strain and emotion,’ he read out. A look of real disgust crossed over his face.‘She even tried that! Well, I ask you...if I hadn’t done that...’We began to talk about the abdication. ‘People can say what they like for it or against it, I don’t care but one thing is certain: I acted in good faith. And I was treated bloody shabbily.’  Wallis Simpson (left) poses wearing her wedding ring. Queen Mary (right) in an official portrait One random example of this treatment, with which I strongly sympathised, was the fact (attested by receipted bills) that he had produced £4,000 of the £8,000 for the St George’s Chapel monument for his father, Queen Mary paying the other half, and he had not even been invited to the dedication of it nor had it ever been published anywhere that he had contributed.I said: ‘I think one of Queen Mary’s chief difficulties in understanding your dilemma was the fact that she had never been in love herself.’‘No, I don’t think she had,’ he said. ‘You’re right. My mother was a cold woman, a cold woman. And I, you see, I suppose I had never really been in love before. No, I hadn’t. I thought I had, but I hadn’t ever been in love.’  The Duchess of Windsor  (left) pictured at the villa she shares with her husband the Duke of Windsor in 1951. They are pictured together (right) in 1939 after returning from France Before we went back to the drawing room, he said with tired charm: ‘Well, I did my best, you know. I tried to bring the monarchy into touch.’But didn’t George V and Queen Mary start that, with their industrial tours in 1913 and so on?‘In a way they did, but not really. And think of my grandfather (Edward VII).’ His face lit up mischievously and boyishly: ‘Why, look at my grandfather. He’d just sit in an open landau, receive an address, snip a ribbon and declare something open, returning to dine with his girlfriends.

There are 11 so far ranging across fiction and non-fiction and she is particularly taken with an Odyssey-based memoir by Daniel Mendelsohn, which points out that, for all its derring-do, the Homeric epic revolves around a bed (the one to which Odysseus returns and Penelope has kept warm, accepting him back as her husband only when he recognises it as “a living tree”).Barker’s contribution to this growing subgenre is The Silence of the Girls, which looks at Homer’s other epic, the Iliad, from the vantage point of the enslaved Trojan queen, Briseis. One of four books in contention for the Costa novel of the year, and with a film deal just signed, it has been widely acclaimed as a triumphant departure from her familiar stamping grounds of the first and second world wars. “It’s the first time I’ve had a group of women sitting together over a dish of wine talking about what men are like in bed,” she says. To put it bluntly (as Barker’s women do), Agamemnon prefers “the back gate” and Achilles is “quick”.The novel is set during the siege of Troy, as the Greek army builds up to its final assault, surrounded by the “sex slaves” captured in its previous victories. Though the story hasn’t been updated in any overt way, her Greek and Trojan women are gossiping all around us in the homely north of England pub. As she says of her characters: “They are very north-eastern – and why not? It’s about toughness, irreverence, humour and bitterness all thrown in together.”Take away the bitterness, and the 75-year-old novelist could be describing herself. “In my personal life I think you’d say there have been a number of prominent women,” she says. It was the storytelling of her working-class grandmother and great-aunts that taught her about the richness of contested history. “They would argue passionately. One sister believed her father was a drunkard, another believed equally strongly that he never touched a drop.”But as she thinks on, she wonders if something more profound might be going on too. “You could also say that as people get near their end they return to the beginning. It’s a way of trying to make sense of their experience, but that raises the question of what we are coming to the end of.” Half of her 14 novels have dealt with the fallout from the first and second world wars. “At the end of the last century there was a return to the first world war. It was an attempt to see what has driven us so far off course,” she says. “But you could argue, and perhaps it is true, that time’s up: we’re at the end of patriarchy, and I’m fine with that as long as it’s remembered that among the victims of patriarchy the vast majority are men.”Brought up “on the pancrack” (national assistance) on Teesside by her beloved grandmother, her personal experience of the domestic catastrophe of warfare was fortuitously limited. Her step-grandfather had a bayonet wound from the first world war and her father “is supposed to have died in the second world war, though I don’t think anybody can be sure what happened because nobody knew who he was. But my mother always presented herself as a widow because it was a terrible shame to have a child without a father.”Elinor’s letter turns out to foreshadow her latest book to an uncanny extent. Describing what it is like in London’s once glamorous Café Royal, which she and Paul used to haunt with their art school set, she writes: “Now it’s full of frightened old men who think their day is over (and they’re probably right) and overexcited young men who jabber till the spit flies, though it’s only stuff they’ve read in the paper. The women have gone very quiet. It’s like the Iliad, you know, when Achilles insults Agamemnon and Agamemnon says he’s got to have Achilles’ girl and Achilles goes off and sulks by the long ships and the girls they’re quarrelling over say nothing, not a word … I don’t suppose men ever hear that silence.”A paradox of The Silence of the Girls is that Barker’s excavation of that silence has brought her back to the loquacious, female-centred worldview of her earliest work. Union Street (1982), Blow Your House Down (1984) and The Century’s Daughter (1986) were all set in the north-east and published by the feminist imprint Virago. By the end of the decade she was feeling claustrophobic, complaining that she “had got myself into a box where I was strongly typecast as a northern, regional, working class, feminist – label, label, label – novelist”. Particularly irksome to her was the recurrent question of whether she could write men – “as though that were some kind of Everest”.Her response was to leave Virago and begin work on her name-making Regeneration trilogy, which recentred her reputation in the predominantly male arena of warfare – “or more generally speaking violence, because there’s criminal violence in my work and some domestic violence too, though basically it’s about the trauma of war”. Published in 1991, Regeneration wasn’t the immediate hit it is often now assumed to have been, she points out – “most overnight successes in literature took 20 years’ hard slog” – but the second novel, The Eye in the Door, won her the  fiction award and the third, The Ghost Road, scooped the 1995 Booker prize.One of the strengths of her war writing is the unflinching eye she brings to its bodily horrors. Her novels are full of hospitals in which wounded soldiers struggle with psychological and physical mutilation. In Life Class a soldier’s attempt to kill himself leaves “his left eyeball swinging against his cheek” in The Silence of the Girls, wounds “crackle” with gangrene (a symptom you can find today on the NHS website). But she is quick to give Homer his due: “The violence is incredibly accurately described. I do believe that late in the formation of these stories there was a single mind reshaping them and it was a mind that was very familiar with the inside of the human body: with the kidneys, the liver. He could only have learned that on the battlefield.”Barker’s search for a female perspective brought her to the realisation that “of course the young men who died were husbands – and, particularly poignantly, sons”. She gifted to Briseis her belief that the stories of “common women whose names you won’t have heard” can humanise history by recalling the childhood foibles of dead heroes or the long labours their mothers suffered giving birth to them.All the same, it was a challenge to maintain interest in the men without breaking faith with Briseis’s chilling insight that the alienation between the warriors and their captives was so complete that “A slave isn’t a person who’s being treated as a thing. A slave is a thing.” To do so, Barker counterpoints Achilles’ contempt for his concubine with his love for his foster brother, Patroclus. Their relationship is sensuously drawn. Are they gay lovers? “I have no hang-ups about writing about gay relationships, as readers of The Eye in the Door will remember, but I didn’t want their relationship to be sweaty buttocks in a tent because I think it’s much more interesting than that. There’s a presexual bond and also they’re brothers in arms, which can be very passionate, though it’s not spoken about in those terms.”Any criticism of the novel has tended to centre on the credibility of her feminised perspective, particularly with regard to Helen, who has a spiky cameo as a style icon contemptuous of less beautiful women’s attempts to copy her eye makeup, and whose tapestries – full of men “gutted, skewered, filleted” – are described as “a way of saying: I’m here. Me. A person, not just an object to be looked at and fought over.” Barker is fiercely dismissive of such quibbles, insisting, “All the anachronisms are deliberate.” Her soldiers are prone to breaking out in bawdy ballads when drunk, “and I keep having to explain that I don’t exactly believe that Homeric warriors were singing English rugby songs either”. What, she asks, does it mean to say a character who never existed was anachronistic? “You can be anachronistic about Elizabeth I but not about Helen.”In the Trojan war as in many others, she points out, it is women who survive, even if their voices are not reported. “It’s women who carry the can long-term not exclusively – some men become carers for their wounded sons – but mostly it’s women, long after the politicians have forgotten.” This brings us to the great and enduring subject of doomed youth, which leaves a devastating trail through millennia of warfare and has particular resonance today, a century after the great slaughter of the first world war.As a remain voter in a strongly pro-Brexit area, she is clear that “one side of the immense battiness of Brexit is the young feeling they’ve been done out of something by the old, which is almost more worrying than the ision between London and the rest of the country, although that is also extremely deep.” As a beneficiary of free education – who went from grammar school to study international history at the London School of Economics and on to a teaching job before getting her first novel published at the age of 40 – she is acutely aware of the betrayal of young people following behind her: “I doubt I’d be able to go to university today.” While she doesn’t consider herself to be a working-class writer, “in that I don’t write consciously of working-class experience in the way I once did, I always take pride in producing working-class characters who are not just there for light relief as they unforgivably are in many novels about the middle classes.”But one unexpected side-effect of the Brexit earthquake, she believes, is that it has woken up at least some movers and shakers to the dangers of a them-and-us society. “I think publishing is more and more interested in having regional voices. So it was a shock which has its salutary side.” More generally, she is optimistic that women are claiming joint ownership of a world to which they have historically been denied access. “So yes, I think in that sense time’s up. It gives me a reason to get up in the morning, as it should every woman.” • The Silence of the Girls is published by Hamish Hamilton.

Research has found that a quarter of smartphone users never use them to make a voice call.“Calling someone is a bit daunting,” said one 18-year-old respondent in a survey on phone habits conducted by Ofcom. “It’s much easier and quicker to WhatsApp my friends. If I have to call a company, I’ll always try to use webchat if it’s available.”Last year, Ofcom found the average Briton checked their mobile phone every 12 minutes. It also found that, for the first time, the time spent making phone calls from mobiles fell, as users instead used messaging services instead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40dedf669c0580594e059ae1ccf8b8f467edf497/0_121_4569_2742/master/4569.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e0b697740870639e7d6d1fdf342502e","title":"no deal brexit dragons den chris grayling javid tory","story":"Grayling, Javid, Davis: few have done more to positively discriminate in favour of incompetents than this Tory governmentThere’s a certain type of movie character that finds time to suggest a shag even in the midst of a crisis. If anything, the fact the bomb clock is ticking or planetary destruction is pending gets them in the mood. The Tories are like that, but with backstabbing. There are 84 days until Brexit, Theresa May’s deal is about to get voted down heavily and bump the UK a few weeks closer to a calamitous no-deal exit, and the first thought of certain Tory leadership hopefuls is, “Ooh, how can I do over ‘the Saj’?”If you missed this latest flurry of displacement activity, a report claimed the home secretary refers to himself in the third person during meetings. According to what a source told the Sun, and which Javid hotly denied: “He uses phrases like, ‘Just you watch what the Sajid is going to do about this’, or ‘the Saj will sort that out’.” Oof. These drive-bys made a charming companion piece to the articles suggesting that Javid was failing to get a grip on Britain’s nonexistent migrant “crisis”, and the very detailed articles about Javid’s very luxurious South African holiday.The sheer amount of energy senior Tories have expended knifing occasional leadership frontrunner Sajid Javid this week is quite spellbinding. It’s like discovering that, as the Deepwater Horizon rig had blown out and begun spewing vast amounts of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, BP executives had decided to hold a 96-hour black-tie murder mystery party. Even by the Conservatives’ own standards, there’s a true decadence to it.But please don’t get me wrong. I would be very relaxed if we were witnessing The Last Days of the Saj, given the home secretary’s deportment this week. To stand on a dock and suggest that Britain “will do everything we can” to stop refugees from achieving asylum in order to deter other refugees is morally repugnant and arguably illegal.To do so transparently to promote your career, and only after very reluctantly tearing yourself away from your £840-per-person-per-night luxury South African safari resort suggests you’ve got some crucial part of the leadership lobe missing and should be invalided out of future contests without delay.And so to the holiday that put the home secretary in such a misanthropic mood. Assuming the quoted rate is based on double occupancy, the Dulini Lodge clocks in at almost £1,700 per room per night, which feels … a lot? I mean, you’re spotting giraffes, not being treated for sex addiction. For £1,700 a night, I wouldn’t want to just spot Harvey Weinstein – I think I’d want to be taking his head home for my trophy wall. I have a Minnesotan dentist he’d look great next to. Javid is furious about what he sees as the tactical leaking of his private plunge pool and wine cellar arrangements, and suspects a specific senior No 10 figure. Could be. That said, which of us would rule out any number of other rivals, having watched cub defence secretary Gavin Williamson pointedly say he hadn’t received a request from Javid for a navy vessel to patrol the Channel. A clearly stung Javid let it be known that he had now written to Williamson to request just such a thing. Surprised he didn’t hire a skywriter. Then again, there’s something fitting about this grotesquery playing out like a wildly passive-aggressive epistolary novel in the Les Liaisons Dangereuses mould. “My dear Vicomte Williamson …” “My dear Le Saj …”In the end, though, neither of these posturing inadequates was sufficient to distract from Chris Grayling. This government is now so inanimate it doesn’t have a spirit animal it has a spirit vegetable. Unless Grayling’s a mineral, which I’ll increasingly accept.Few organisations have done more to positively discriminate in favour of the clueless or incompetent than the Tory administrations of the past few years, but even accounting for the likes of Iain Duncan Smith and Andrea Leadsom, Chris Grayling is the ultimate poster child for anyone whose inner voice tells them they couldn’t be something because they’re honestly just sensationally bad at it.In a move in no way likely to hint at the delights to come, 2019 began with Chris Grayling taking to the airwaves seeking to justify the fact that, as part of his no-deal preparations, he has awarded a £13.8m ferry contract to a company with no ferries. According to Grayling, he’s very relaxed about Seaborne Freight, and will “make no apologies for supporting a new British business”. I like how Chris is treating no-deal Brexit like an episode of Dragons’ Den. Not only does Seaborne Freight have no ferries, but as the week wore on it turned out to have cut and pasted its website terms and conditions from those of a food delivery service. For that reason, I’m out.It was the same at the last-but-one Tory conference, when a comedian managed to get to Theresa May and hand her a p45 during her speech, only to be belatedly taken away by security. “He’s lucky I didn’t hit him,” Davis told reporters several days after the event, “or he’d have been down for a long time.” Mmm. If you look at the footage from the conference hall, luck doesn’t have a whole lot to do with it. David Davis doesn’t hit the unknown man who approaches the prime minister as a potential security threat, because David Davis stays sitting in his chair the whole time. Not so much a tale of derring-do, as a tale of derring-didn’t.I can’t think why it might be that, at last year’s conference, alleged leadership frontrunner Sajid Javid could barely half-fill the conference hall. If I ever do put my finger on it, I imagine it will be closely related to the reason Javid feels he must be twice as hard and heartless on migrants as anyone else in the cabinet – as well as the sort of guy who goes further than everyone, and talks about “sick Asian paedophiles”.Until then, it’s worth bearing in mind that, unless Tory MPs somehow unite around a single successor to May, they will be sending two names out to be decided upon by this particular mind pool. Will that time come later or sooner? Happy New Year, either way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1243a6cbf3c135dc01de797130f40998ac330823/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b085017a72891add9a4d9d4ec93cc30","title":"why us first palestinian american congresswoman is such a big deal","story":"The day Rashida Tlaib was sworn into Congress was momentous, but it doesn’t eradicate the difficulties people of Palestinian origin face in the USA few years ago, I went with a friend and her family to a Jewish restaurant in New York City known for comfort food and vodka. Early in the evening, its entertainer asked everyone where they were from, and my friend’s dad announced I was Palestinian. He meant well: it was an enthusiastic “Isn’t it great we’re all getting along?” statement. The entertainer wasn’t quite so enthusiastic, and proclaimed to the room: “There’s no such thing as a Palestinian.” I left in tears. It kinda ruined dinner.While the restaurant incident was particularly unpleasant, it wasn’t the first or last time I have been told Palestinians don’t exist. It happens all the time. I am proud of being Palestinian, but it gets exhausting having to constantly prove your humanity and plead your legitimacy. It gets exhausting reiterating you don’t hate anyone, you just want to be treated with dignity. So, in the end, just to make things easier, you start erasing your identity yourself. I often vaguely say I’m half-Arab, half-English when people ask where I am from. Over time, you stop taking joy in your heritage and tiptoe warily around it instead.Which is why 3 January, when Rashida Tlaib became the first Palestinian American to be sworn into Congress, was such a momentous day for me and so many other Palestinians. Tlaib did not tiptoe around her heritage instead she wore a traditional Palestinian thobe (gown) for the occasion, prompting hundreds of other Palestinians to share proud pictures of their own national dresses, with the hashtag #TweetYourThobe. In an article for Elle explaining why she wore her thobe, Tlaib stressed: “We should embrace who we are and not be shamed for it.” It was a shame there was a need for her to say that a shame I needed to hear it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0813a6519216efe494de31e70e770e1a2dcfe6f8/0_21_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=252060d929565c59600a8f379fa0cd25","title":"alberta the ultimate seven day drive itinerary","story":"Yearning to hit the open road? Consistently named as one of the most scenic drives in the world, this route from Calgary to Edmonton through the Rockies is hard to beatWith a flourishing bar and dining scene, and a number of erse and arty neighbourhoods, cosmopolitan, multicultural Calgary is much more than just the gateway to the Rockies. Direct flights from London (daily from Heathrow, and multiple times a week from Gatwick) also make it a convenient starting point. Load-up and learn, with a food tour of the historic Inglewood neighbourhood. The tour stops at the high-end Rouge, in what’s now a heritage site, as well as taking in Alberta’s First Nations arts and food culture.Style-up and get your cowboy threads sorted year-round at the Alberta Boot Company, or head to Smithbilt for the distinctive white hats that have become a symbol of the city – so that when the Calgary Stampede rodeo comes to town in July, you look the part.Head for the hills to start your roadtrip. Banff national park – Canada’s oldest – is an easy hour-and-a-half drive from Calgary. But don’t skip the picturesque and vibrant mountain town of Canmore, just outside the park’s boundary, where the peaks of the Rockies provide the backdrop to numerous music and arts festivals throughout the year.For a town with a population of just under 14,000 people, the town is overflowing with dining and drinking destinations. And it also claims the honour of being home to the largest number of Olympians per capita in Canada, who use the altitude to train. (If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.)In the summer, hit the bike trails. A 13-mile trail connects to Banff, with an additional 50 miles of other pathways to follow. In winter, try out one of the newest crazes in these parts: fat biking. Extra-large tyres will take you across otherwise inaccessible snow-covered trails. Don’t fret, there are hand-warmers too. Afterwards, head on to Banff to warm-up at the thermal waters of the Upper Hot Springs.It’s impossible to be bored in Banff with the myriad activities on offer. If you want action and adventure, try white-water rafting, rock climbing and horse riding. If you want to take it easy, just find a patio, order a coffee and sit and watch the clouds move over the mountains that hug the town. If you want something in between, how about a round of golf? Banff has some of the most beautiful courses in the world. You certainly can’t skip town without a fondue from the unironically kitsch Grizzly House.Put simply, Lake Louise doesn’t look real. Its searing blue waters reflect back the towering glacier that created the lake 10,000 years ago. While in the winter the lake freezes over and becomes a fairy-tale setting for ice skaters and sleigh rides, in the summer it’s populated by canoes with travellers keen to glimpse the ice close-up. When you get tired of taking in the views from the genteel-surrounds of the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise – if such a thing is possible – take the steep 2-mile (3.5-km) hike from the hotel to the Disney-esque Lake Agnes Tea House. First built by the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1901 as a shelter for hikers, this lakeshore log cabin sits in a valley of its own, and has been serving tea since 1905.The spectacularly scenic Icefields Parkway hugs hillsides and traces its way past more than 100 ancient glaciers on its 146-mile (235-km) route from Lake Louise to Jasper national park.With dramatic waterfalls and sweeping lakes at nearly every turn, you’re going to want to stop often. Head to the highest point of the parkway to stop at the viewpoint for the glowing turquoise waters of Peyto Lake. And leave time to explore the Columbia Icefield, the largest ice field in the Rocky Mountains. You can tour it in a massive all-terrain vehicle or, if you fancy a bird’s eye view, by helicopter. And at the Glacier Discovery Centre, tours will take you to walk on the up-to-300m thick ice of the Athabasca Glacier.Sweet little Jasper – home to just 4,500 people – has charm. Surrounded by natural beauty, it’s an adventure sports hub, and a key stop for the iconic Rocky Mountaineer train. You’ll be spoiled for choice for places to eat. Papa George’s – a family-run Jasper institution since 1925, offers comfort food, such as fluffy buttermilk pancakes, in a homely environment. Head out of town for one of the great Rocky Mountain experiences – a cruise across Maligne Lake. Here, you’ll find the stunning Spirit Island – its tiny grouping of trees, surrounded by crystal blue water, has made it one of the world’s most photographed beauty spots.Head east from the mountains to the metropolis. Nicknamed “festival city”, Edmonton always has something going on – from music festivals to fringe theatre, to farmers’ markets. Make sure you check out the atmosphere of the historic Old Strathcona, which has plenty of quirky, independent shopping, restaurants and bars. Encompassing more than 90 miles (150km) of multi-use trails and over 20 major city parks, the lush Edmonton River valley is the largest expanse of urban parkland in North America.

It involves pumping water, chemicals and usually sand underground at high pressure to fracture shale – hence the name – and release the gas trapped within to be collected back at the surface.The technology has transformed the US energy landscape in the last decade, owing to the combination of high-volume fracking – 1.5m gallons of water per well, on average – and the relatively modern ability to drill horizontally into shale after a vertical well has been drilled.Several other authorities – including Leeds, Wakefield, Hull and York – have expressed opposition to fracking, and experts believe the stance taken by Manchester and London will embolden others.Many Conservatives are also opposed. In Westminster, almost two dozen Tory MPs are reported to be against fracking and willing to “destroy the government’s majority” if it tries to weaken planning laws.Several Tory-run local authorities – including Derby, Dorset and Nottinghamshire – are fiercely opposed to the change in planning proposals, which would mean companies could drill test sites without applying for planning permission.Manchester’s decision echoes similar policies already pursued by the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales. Scottish government has a shale gas moratorium and the Welsh government has promised to block any applications.Tom Fyans from the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), said Greater Manchester’s policy was a significant moment. “The decision is symbolic of the growing opposition to the government’s plans to fast-track fracking, which look to override local democracy by disregarding the wishes of local communities and deny those very people the opportunity to have their say on decisions that will ultimately affect them and the health of their countryside,” he said.Burnham said: “It’s about embracing the future, not the past. Cities like Greater Manchester need to join the group of leading cities on the world stage that are driving fast towards carbon neutrality.“That is a big challenge and it must be embraced wholeheartedly, and it means a full commitment to renewable energy and not half measures, and not clinging on to processes that hark back to a past.”In London, the city’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, who last month declared a “climate emergency”, has said he will throw out all fracking proposals. His draft London plan, which will be ratified later this year, introduces an effective ban on fracking across the capital.Tony Bosworth of Friends of the Earth said: “It’s not surprising that they are opposed by local councils around the country, including many controlled by the Conservatives. In order to deal with the climate crisis, we need to be moving away from fossil fuels, not making it easier for companies to dig up more.”About 2.6 million people live in Greater Manchester, large parts of which are within “shale-prospective areas” identified by the British Geological Survey and the Oil and Gas Authority. Energy companies have been granted licences to pursue oil and gas exploration in the west and north of the region, with iGas the first to drill a combined coalbed methane and shale gas exploration well in Barton Moss in Salford in 2013-14.The combined authority’s proposals on fracking are part of a wider, more ambitious environmental plan. Manchester city council, one of its10 local authorities, has already agreed to the goal after accepting advice from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. The wider region is expected to follow suit soon.Burnham said the decision to move against fracking came about after council leaders looked at what happened in Lancashire, where fracking started in October at Preston New Road near Blackpool against the will of the local authority after a government intervention. The earthquakes caused by the Cuadrilla activity were a serious concern, Burnham said.“For the legal limits to be breached so regularly is a worry, isn’t it? It’s hard to know what damage is being done and the effect that is having on groundwater and all of those other issues that emerge,” he said.“It’s even more worrying in Greater Manchester, which is a much more urban place, where there is more contaminated land, more mine shafts. This is an industry which hasn’t proven its case. In fact, the opposite.”Burnham accepted that Greater Manchester did not have the power to implement a ban on fracking. “That’s a reflection of government policy and not our policy. We would if we could,” he said. “We are doing what we can within the legal structures that we have got at our disposal.”The policy will be announced on Monday as part of the Greater Manchester spatial framework, which sets out a strategic plan for the city region until 2037. Local leaders have agreed to include concerns about the impacts arising from the exploitation of new sources of hydrocarbons. They believe the government’s support for fracking means there is less of an imperative to invest in new zero-carbon technologies.In September 2018, the petrochemical company Ineos lost a legal challenge against the Scottish government’s position on fracking, when Scotland’s highest court ruled politicians had not exceeded their powers by imposing a moratorium against fracking for oil and gas.Burnham said he was hopeful that energy companies would respect Greater Manchester’s wishes and not apply to frack in the region. “There has never been a legal case involving a spatial framework of this kind. We would be empowering our own communities to take on a government policy which at times seems to impose its will on local communities,” he said.Energy industry analysts have begun to question the economic feasibility of fracking in the UK. Since 2013, gas prices have fallen sharply and there is no shortage of supply in Europe or across the world. German import prices – the standard European benchmark – are half their 2013 level. It is also not yet proven that the substantial shale resources present under the the north of England and elsewhere in the UK can be recovered at a commercially viable volume, as in the US.The government’s determination to press ahead with fracking in light of mounting evidence of climate breakdown has also been criticised by leading scientists. Jim Hansen, known as the father of climate change awareness, accused ministers of ignoring scientific fact.However, the government had defended the practice. A Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said: “Shale gas has the potential to be a new domestic energy source, enhancing our energy security and delivering economic benefits, including the creation of well-paid, quality jobs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8b7b1adeb3846721739d27f3f727c95d537fa50/282_889_3402_2040/master/3402.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=420cf1dd28f96e2a919044a7a33db744","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Rescued turtles, piggybacking toads and a sadly missed rhino feature in this week’s gallery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/389381876ef82420bd77b85b412429c28acad429/0_0_4911_2946/master/4911.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=774dc075d67addb50e8aadcb8ed7d905","title":"london fashion week mens charles jeffrey loverboy david beckham menswear","story":"Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, A-Cold-Wall* and David Beckham star, as interest in menswear boomsThe British menswear market has plenty to be pleased about. With London fashion week men’s poised to kick off on Saturday, reports reveal men in the UK are spending an increasing amount on fashion.Jones said a “really powerful new generation of UK talent” had helped London fashion week become more exciting than its New York, Milan and Paris counterparts.Among the brands presenting their autumnwinter 2019 collections this weekend are Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, Craig Green and A-Cold-Wall*. Jones said these designers “have the same zeitgeist feel we saw with BodyMap in the 80s and Alexander McQueen in the 90s”.“This industry should be an option for kids from across the UK, no matter what background they come from. I have been most inspired by the workshops we have been doing with children at school age. Their energy and creativity is just incredible and that’s why I am doing this.”This season there would be more Asian designers – such as Xander Zhou and Feng Chen Wang – than ever before, said Jones, who credited the “talismanic effect” of Beckham.“It’s easy to forget the huge profile he has internationally, especially in Asia,” Jones said. “We’re seeing more and more relationships built with Asia, and a lot of the funding for our menswear and our GQBFC fund – which will be announced on Monday – comes from there. He’s been a tremendous success.”Beckham said: “London is a global city and fashion and design is in demand from a global audience. It’s great that Asian brands believe that showing in London gives them a chance to reach that audience.”Although many fear Brexit may deter budding designers from setting up studios in the UK, as well as affecting established brands, the BFC has pledged to continue to invest heavily in mentoring schemes and initiatives to support the wider industry.Despite the upbeat tone, the London fashion pack is mourning the death of the designer Joe Casely-Hayford, who dressed the Clash and U2 early in his career. An influential presence on the British fashion scene, he frequently showed his collections at London fashion week.The fashion critic Sarah Mower told British Vogue: “It’s poignant that the London menswear shows are starting on Brick Lane on Saturday,” the fashion critic Sarah Mower told British Vogue, referring to how Casely-Hayford was long associated with that area of east London.Mower said he was the “first London designer to bring the cultural mix and energy of the East End together with the amazing skills of a Savile Row tailor”, paving the way for many newcomers presenting their collections this weekend.Despite his brand being less than three years old, the Glaswegian designer has won numerous prestigious awards. His radical nightclub-meets-couture aesthetic resulted in US Vogue recently calling him “London’s pioneering Pied Piper of the creative, queer club scene”.The Central Saint Martins graduate is in London after a stint at the menswear shows in Florence last year. His beautifully crafted and conceptual designs have been credited with setting the mainstream menswear agenda. Green is tipped to be snapped up by a big fashion house soon.The whirlwind success of Samuel Ross and his label was capped by the self-taught London-based designer winning the emerging talent prize at the Fashion awards last month.

He has been there, he has done it, and is shifting towards drama. “It’s fine to be biting, acerbic and silly when you’re young,” he says. “But when you grow up you need to act like a grownup.” Then he catches himself and winces at his presumption. “Maybe that just means I’ve got flabby and middle aged.”The jury is still out but I think maturity suits him. Coogan’s reputation was forged during his hectic 90s heyday, when he carried himself like a Premier League footballer, the cocksure comic striker behind witless Alan Partridge. These days, the hair has gone grey while the roles have turned more knotty, nuanced and tender. He was deftly affecting in the Bafta-winning Philomena, thin-skinned and whip-smart in Michael Winterbottom’s The Trip, and he gives a lovely, limber performance in Stan \u0026amp Ollie, a bittersweet account of the duo’s swansong British tour.Coogan explains that he started his career doing the voices on Spitting Image, so impersonating Laurel came relatively easily (the diffident smile the precise, flat vowels). The hard part was digging behind the facade, revealing the man behind the screen image. But he is wary of sounding too precious about this God forbid he should come over all Daniel Day-Lewis. “I’ve never really been a method actor,” he scoffs. “I don’t think Mike Leigh would like me. If he wanted me to do a medieval melodrama, I’d still be wearing my underpants from Marks \u0026amp Spencer underneath my costume I don’t care what he says.”There is a cafetiere inside the hotel room. Coogan insists on playing mother. He pours the coffee with a flourish but then struggles with the milk, which comes in a little carton that must be pierced with a plastic straw. His angle is wrong the milk squirts out in a jet. For a brief, fleeting moment, he could be Partridge back at the Linton Travel Tavern.On screen, Laurel played gormless underling to Hardy’s finicky little king. Off screen, though, the roles were reversed. Laurel co-directed the pictures and devised the bulk of the gags. He was at once ringmaster and clown, the artist and the clay, to the point where it became difficult to spot where the man ended and the character began.On screen (and arguably off it, too) Laurel and Hardy were at once inseparable and at permanent loggerheads. They gave the impression of being as much tragic as funny, the inspiration for Vladimir and Estragon in Waiting for Godot. And at times Stan \u0026amp Ollie – directed by John S Baird with a script by Jeff Pope, Coogan’s co-writer on Philomena – feels more indebted to Samuel Beckett than to the comedy of Laurel and Hardy producer Hal Roach. It’s a dying fall of a film: a tale of dwindling resources and aching limbs and two men who suspect they are being edged inexorably towards the exit door. Coogan thinks that this is entirely as it should be.“It’s hard to make a comedy from success,” he explains. “The best ones are about failure and bad luck and inadequacy. And this film is about the transience of all the success that went before.” Another pause. “Do you know that film Anvil: The Story of Anvil? It’s a documentary about a heavy metal band and their glory days are behind them and they’re flat broke. And I don’t particularly like the music. In fact, I sort of hate it. But what I was really moved by was their affection and unfailing loyalty in middle age. It’s only as they get older that they realise they love each other.”I wonder if the same might be said of The Trip. If not a tale of failure, exactly, Michael Winterbottom’s sitcom, initially on BBC Two, now on Sky Atlantic, brilliantly exposes the limits of success, the fragility of the male ego and the bond between two sparring partners whose relationship is closer than they would care to admit. Coogan and Rob Brydon play versions of themselves: affluent, status-conscious performers, each vying for the upper hand. Coogan likes to dismiss Brydon as a middle-of-the-road entertainer, a reliable footsoldier on the panel-show circuit. Brydon, in turn, suggests that his rival is a 1990s timepiece, a hedonistic antique like “Oasis or cocaine”. The Trip is partly scripted, partly improvised. It’s a comedy fiction, but there’s a truth to it, too.Coogan pushes his spectacles back up the bridge of his nose. “I remember Rob once saying to me: ‘The trouble with you is that you’re not funny any more.’”Wait a minute … was this on camera or off? “God knows. It was in that sort of grey area in between. He was thinking: ‘What will really annoy Steve?’ And I remember thinking: ‘That’s not the worst thing you can say to me.’ I don’t think: ‘Oh my God, if I’m not funny my whole existence will crumble.’ It’s not my oxygen, being funny all the time. That’s a dysfunction. It’s just weird, to be honest. It would bother him more that’s probably why he said it.” He grimaces. “I mean, if someone said I was boring, that would bother me. But if I’m no longer funny, well, then I’ll do something not funny. There are a lot of other things to be.”For Stan Laurel, born in Lancashire and raised on music hall, the 1953 British tour was a homecoming of sorts. In his own way, Coogan is similarly circling back to his roots. He was born in Middleton, north of Manchester, to a large Irish Catholic family. He says that the older he gets, the more Irish he feels.“I’d like to claim I was a horny-handed son of toil,” he says. “But it was a more lower middle-class or upper working-class background.” His dad worked as an engineer for IBM the family was solidly socialist and prized education above all else. “I mean, we didn’t have a colour TV for such a long time. Even though the people on the council estate did have one and my grandmother got one straight away from Radio Rentals. So we didn’t have a colour telly, but we did have the Encyclopaedia Britannica. And so we were very aspirational as a family. There was this notion that, all being well, all of us kids would eventually end up as teachers.”By his early 20s, however, Coogan was already earning a decent living as a voiceover artist and standup comic. He joined the ensemble cast of Radio 4 comedy On the Hour (which subsequently morphed into BBC Two’s The Day Today) and won the Perrier award at the 1992 Edinburgh festival fringe. He became hugely successful at an indecently young age. I’m guessing his showbiz lifestyle made him the black sheep of the family, but he says that this was never really the case.“In terms of my profession, there was a precedent on my father’s side. My grandfather ran a dancehall in the 50s for Irish immigrants, when they were subject to the same prejudice as Jews and black people. You know, it was the era of ‘No blacks, dogs or Irish’. There was a certain ghettoisation in Manchester back then. Middleton had a lot of Irish people and it was right next door to Prestwich, which had a lot of Jewish people. But also, Catholicism isn’t puritanism. Catholicism allows you to get drunk and have a nice time. And if you’re from a working-class background, you’re expected to sing for your supper. Everybody does a turn. So it wasn’t that me being a performer was frowned upon. Quite the opposite, in fact.”The way Coogan tells it, his career has been shaped by an ongoing creative friction, even a niggling uncertainty about exactly what kind of artist he aspired to be. During the course of his career, he has bounced between what he refers to as his “Manchester gang” (Caroline Aherne, Jon Thomson, Craig Cash) and the “Oxbridge gang” (Armando Iannucci, Patrick Marber, Chris Morris) between big, bland Hollywood fodder and small, smart British productions. Partridge, I suspect, provides the man with his lynchpin: a popular character who has been allowed the space to take on a finer texture. Coogan says that he still loves to play Partridge and still laughs when he watches his antics on screen.So he’s basically saying he laughs at his own jokes? “Well, yeah,” he says, briefly rattled. “Because I don’t see it when I’m doing it. So when I watch it back in the editing suite, I feel the same delight as the audience would. I see Alan as Alan. I don’t see him as me.”During his 20s and 30s, Coogan was a favourite tabloid pinata. We thrilled to tales of how he liked nothing better than to snort rails of cocaine and then have sex with lap dancers. These days, he is a more sober, thoughtful figure, banging the drum for press regulation and writing op-eds calling for a second EU referendum. The change has been so striking it feels like a reinvention. I can’t quite work him out. Has Coogan grown more serious with age? Or was he always like this but elected to hide it?“I don’t know,” he says. “I think I’ve always had a political dimension. My family was political. I remember being told that Jesus was a socialist. But I was also very ambitious. And I started earning a lot of money early on. And I became apolitical. I thought: ‘Oh, sod all that.’ And it went to my head. It was like a sort of delayed adolescence.” Another pause: “But then you realise that all this stuff is transient and that you’re middle aged and that one day you’re going to be dead. And so you might as well make an effort to engage in some way.”I last met him when Philomena came out back in 2013. Back then, Coogan was a bracing, combative interviewee. He saw every question as a potential ambush and moved to thwart any perceived journalistic angle. Today, though, he seems more comfortable with the process, more at ease with himself. It used to be that he felt he always had to have his guard up. Now he accepts that he can sometimes afford to let it drop. He’s middle aged and a mass of insecurity and contradictions. He suspects that, on balance, that’s not such a terrible thing to be.“And actually I think acknowledging your own fallibility makes you a better artist and a better person,” he says in a rush. “It’s fairly obvious to me that the real wisdom lies in seeing people’s failings and trying to understand them. Because the alternative is that very childlike, Donald Trump thing of believing that admitting any weakness is fatal. What was it Bukowski said? All the clever people are full of self-doubt and all the stupid people are very confident. That’s the era we’re living in now. That’s the era I don’t want to be a part of. So all you can do is try to go about things differently. Do interesting work and don’t be a cunt.”Coogan gulps for breath. His eyes widen and then he rocks with laughter. “There you go, that’s my big artistic statement,” he says. “Do interesting work and don’t be a cunt. Took me the best part of an hour. Got there in the end.”Stan \u0026amp Ollie is in UK cinemas on 11 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a82d1915edff0a315d4a4dffb73d15143e815c4/23_3_2188_1313/master/2188.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b27cadd4ff416f18de9b8f2f95c8ec7","title":"tranmere tottenham fa cup match report","story":"A hat-trick from Fernando Llorente and two goals from Serge Aurier, the first a thumping drive from distance that Harry Kane could hardly have bettered, saw Tottenham into the FA Cup fourth round at the expense of Tranmere Rovers. The League Two side managed to live with their illustrious opponents for most of the first half but were outclassed after the interval, with Son Heung-min pulling the strings. Kane even took the field with the score at 6-0 and managed to add a seventh before the end, taking his tally for the season to 19 and bringing Spurs a 33rd goal in 33 days as well as their biggest away win ever in the FA Cup.“Maybe we are different to everyone else, we always like to be positive,” Mauricio Pochettino said. “I don’t think it was a risk at all to send Harry on for a few minutes. Strikers like to score goals and he got one. We take all the competitions we are in seriously and I also think you need to show respect to the supporters when you are away from home. Some of the people who paid money to see the game probably did so in the hope they might see Harry Kane in action.”Son had a great chance to open the scoring after eight minutes when he raced clear through the middle to take advantage of a deflection from a defender that fell into his path. He had only Scott Davies to beat but shot early and unconvincingly, allowing the goalkeeper to save with his legs. Davies made a rather better save a few minutes later when Connor Jennings lingered too long on the ball in his own half, inviting Juan Foyth to dispossess him with a crunching tackle. The ball again broke kindly for Son, who this time slipped Lucas Moura in to his left, only for the goalkeeper to leave his line quickly to smother the low shot.Spurs did not have their very best team with Kane joined on the bench by Moussa Sissoko, Christian Eriksen and Toby Alderweireld. They were in control of the game nonetheless and almost took the lead on the half-hour when Llorente volleyed narrowly over from a corner. Manny Monthe rose to meet a Liam Ridehalgh corner at the other end shortly afterwards, obliging Paulo Gazzaniga to make his first save of the game to prevent the header creeping under the crossbar.Just when Rovers must have been thinking they might reach half-time unscathed Aurier put Spurs ahead with an unstoppable screamer from 30 yards out. Aurier had merely been standing in the centre of the pitch to provide notional cover at a Tottenham corner when a series of half-clearances by Tranmere sent the ball his way. He was a long way out but his first-time shot had power and accuracy and arrowed unerringly into Davies’ top-left corner.There was very little chance for Tranmere to do anything to save the game as Tottenham increased their lead almost immediately after the break. Son made one of his irresistible charges to the goalline and might well have shot had not the angle been so narrow. Instead he looked up and picked out Llorente perfectly and the Spanish striker tucked away one of the easier goals of his Spurs career from the six-yard line.Tranmere did have an opportunity to pull a goal back when the ball broke to Harvey Gilmour a few yards out, though with the goal at his mercy the midfielder put his shot over the bar. Lucas nearly added a third for the visitors when he skipped neatly around Stephen McNulty but tripped himself up in the process of rounding the goalkeeper.It hardly mattered – Spurs were still four goals up before the hour mark. First Son set up Aurier for his second goal of the evening, a less spectacular effort than the first with the ball only just evading the Tranmere defenders’ efforts to stop it on the line, then Son popped up in space on the left and beat Davies with a low shot rolled into the far corner. When the South Korean was substituted a few minutes later he left the field to applause from all sides of the ground.Two close-range finishes in quick succession from Llorente were harsh on Tranmere, as was the sight of Kane taking the field at 6-0 to replace him and lifting a shot over Davies 10 minutes from time. Ollie Banks had a shot saved and Jake Caprice might have done better with a shooting opportunity but Tranmere were rarely far enough upfield to seek consolation. They were too busy trying to keep the score in single figures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed6ad015c70d12a21ecac852112acf3c103f582e/8_0_2544_1526/master/2544.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2bd8fdc869aae7e3ae55cb8cb1b971b","title":"mo salah liverpool real madrid galactico","story":"In the past 10 years, any Premier League attacker who can maintain an A-list run has become a target of La Liga super clubs – but it would be a terrible idea for the Liverpool strikerIs English football in danger of losing Mohamed Salah to Real Madrid or Barcelona because he is now simply too good to stay?Mido certainly thinks so. Yes: that Mido. The same Mido who once issued a formal apology to Middlesbrough fans for being too fat. The same Mido who is, it turns out, a very good pundit these days and who raised a doubly interesting point this week about Salah’s trajectory in this, his second season of outright Premier League supremacy.No doubt there are Liverpool supporters who might question how well-qualified Mido is to talk about these wider matters. But then there is also probably a detailed academic paper to be written on the way the punditry prospects of retired footballers are linked inexorably to the rise and fall of various features of their own background.For two decades the market was dominated by pinched, Scottish-accented Liverpool players of the mid- to late-1980s, a culture maintained to this day by Graeme Souness who approaches each commentary stint in a state of spleen-crippling horror at the decadence of modern life, while also remaining apparently convinced during his on-screen appearances that everyone in the room is secretly laughing at his shoes.In this game of snakes and ladders, otherwise overlooked retired footballers find a second life as “ex-Manchester City” or “six seasons at Chelsea”, even though Chelsea weren’t very good at the time. Anyone who played for Alex Ferguson or Arsène Wenger, for example, is still deemed a vital and necessary voice.Not that this is a bad thing. There may be no obvious reason why, say, Martin Keown should be such a high-profile public figure, but he has become an agreeably intense presence, dispensing his views with an angry, whispering urgency, like the haunted whistleblower in a grimly authentic spy drama who grabs your arm and snarls into your face on a bench in St James’s Park about – for some reason – the inherent flaws in zonal marking, before being found strangled in a phone box six hours later.And so on to Salah and Mido, who has been prominent on the football-opinion circuit in the past year or so. Mido on the radio. Mido having opinions about transfers. For a while this seemed like an anomaly. Wait, you felt like saying, but what does Yakubu think about this? Or Corrado Grabbi?Except, of course, Mido is in his own way riding the Salah train, using his status as the Egyptian football man we in Britain know best. And happily he’s a good pundit too, unafraid to simply say stuff. A while back I heard Mido talking about the way footballers present a part of their own character on the pitch, that a player can be at his best only when he allows some vital, empowering part of his character to be present and visible in his play, and I thought, yeah, Mido, excellent point.It was a point that came back this week as Mido suggested Salah’s move to Spain was now a near-inevitability, that his continuing success will become “a problem” for Liverpool as the super clubs of La Liga look to fill imminent or existing star vacuums.Mido is right too. Salah would be the obvious candidate for such a role, barring the relocation of the Neymar-industrial complex, a deal that would involve remortgaging the moon and presenting Neymar himself with a sold gold bowler hat handmade by angelic supernatural sex mermaids.It has been the pattern of the past 10 years. Any Premier League attacker who can maintain an A-list run over consecutive seasons tends to become a target. And while Salah was relatively quiet in the defeat by Manchester City on Thursday night, he has been consistently excellent, throwing off his early season rustiness to become even better: more central, more creative and just as prolific.And yet, this would still be a terrible idea – and for more reasons than one. Most obviously, is Salah really the right player for all that? He’s not a machine-attacker at the ludicrously sustained levels set by the Messi-Ronaldo godhead for the past 10 years.Salah is human, a little in and out at times, and all the more endearing for it. He hasn’t scored a goal against the Premier League top four since April. He is a delicate rather than steamrollering talent, at a club where he has been nurtured in exactly the right way.Why change this? Why expose yourself to that impossible star vacuum? Why run the risk of becoming Messi’s “Moyes”? Salah may or may not be good enough and relentless enough for this. But the fact is the old galáctico system feels a little broken and jaded, another example of the unquestioned idea that “progress” and “ambition” – more, bigger, richer – is always good, even when we already have quite enough.There are other ways the world can work. Just as the defining note of this Liverpool team isn’t hunger for victory at all costs but its sense of heart and spirit, that fleeing of fraternal collectivism.In part this is to do with Jürgen Klopp’s ideas about nurture and steady improvement. Salah has been an obvious beneficiary of this human touch, to the extent the idea he must now leave seems not just odd but illogical.No doubt Mido has his own insight into how this might pan out in the cold hard reality. But it doesn’t mean the machine can’t be resisted. Or that success will naturally follow for a player who seems to be in a place where he makes perfect sense, is operating at his own outer limits, and is above all happy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58a0ff3cbfec6ad0373b2750303b50427e77af51/0_0_3478_2086/master/3478.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a204f9dd27f1fdeca7dcc28cc1234b07","title":"tranmere rovers v tottenham hotspur fa cup third round live","story":"A difficult interview for Tranmere manager Micky Mellon: “You’ve got to say Spurs were fantastic. We’re disappointed with certain moments and some of the goals. When you don’t do the right things with the ball you can get punished and we were punished very heavily by a very good team. They’re a fantastic team with outrageously good players. It’s a tough night for the boys but it was a fantastic achievement to bring tottenham here and that’s important.”Pochettino’s verdict: “It was a very professional performance. It was fantastic for our fans. I’m very pleased.” When he’s told by Jake Humphreys that this is Spurs’ record away win, he turns to Harry Redknapp (who’s here on pundit duties) and asks: “you never did it?” Redknapp proceeds to regale him with the tale of that 9-1 home win over Wigan in 2009. Asked about his team’s recent away wins, Pochettino says: “I am so, so pleased because the team is performing very well away from home, showing great character. Maybe it’s helped by playing at Wembley because it’s like playing the whole season away.” He is also asked about his impression’s of yesterday’s Man City-Liverpool match and the title race. “It was very nice to watch but I don’t care about the result. We are in a competition where there are still a lot of games to play. We have to go step by step. Of course we need to be dream and be ambitious but we also have to be realistic.”Tottenham Hotspur were founded in 1882 and never have they won an official away match by a score as big as this. That’s right, folks, you’ve witnessed history. But no hat-trick from Serge Aurier.“Kudos to you and Mike Nagle for the headlines,” blurts Peter Oh. “These recent scores sure do give Spurs an Aurier of invincibility.” Honk! Alli: “We knew it was never going to be easy. It was all about attitude today, we had to give them a lot of respect ... then in the second half we showed our quality. It was a top performance for us but you have to give them credit for working so hard and making it difficult for us in the first half.”Aurier: “I’m happy about my two goals and happy for the team. We’re going to keep going for the next one.” For almost half the game Tranmere sort of held their own ... and then they were blown away. One-nil up at half-time, Spurs were royally superior in the second period and crushed their hosts with almost relentless scoring.90+2 min: Moura tries to get in on the act but bangs over from 20 yards. 89 min: Aurier tries again, this time from 20 yards. He smashes it with great force ... into a defenders face, potentially adding injury to insult.87 min: Banks booked for a studs-first challenge on Skipp. He won the ball but in a naughty way.86 min: Aurier sees the chance for a hat-trick as Kane rolls the ball into his path 20 yards from goal. He lets fly with his left foot ... and the ball sails towards the Irish Sea. 84 min: This is how the FA Cup should be. All I want from a tie is (a) a shock win for the lower league side or (b) a ruthless annihilation of the lower league side by an elite team determined to show their superiority rather than get a couple of goals in front and then knock off.Easy as you like. Alli collects the ball on the left wing, spots a run by Kane and flips the ball into his path with the outside of his foot. Kane dinks it over the advancing goalkeeper. This has been a pleasingly merciless second half by Spurs. Spurs substitution: Eyoma, another debutant, enters the fray in place of Sanchez. He’ll remember this moment rest of his life. Unless Aurier completes a hat-trick, in which case everyone’s minds will be blown.77 min: A lull. We’re approaching four minutes without a shot. Kane can’t be happy with that. “Why are you even MBM’ing this match?” demands-to-know Rob Coughlin. “Better yet, why am I following your every keystroke?” Because we’re addicts. The first step to recovery is to admit that. Spurs substitution: Kane on - because you can never take victory for granted - and Llorente off. 74 min: Freekick to Tranmere, about 25 yards out and central. Consolation coming? Only for people consoled by the sight of Norwood smashing a shot into the wall.Spurs are scoring quicker than I can type! Llorente completes his hat-trick with an almost effortless close-range finish from a cross from the left by Moura.Skipp finds Llorente with a beautiful low pass straight through the home defence. Llorente takes it in his stride and finishes with nonchalant ease.68 min: Tranmere haven’t give up. They’re still buzzing around in the hope of eking out at least one goal for their fans to cheer. “I am sure you have already written your report headline: Spurs Serge to victory,” blares Mike Nagle. It’ll be that or Hip Hip Aurier ...Spurs substitution: Nineteen-year-old George Marsh trots on for his senior debut Son walks off to hearty applause - he’s been excellent yet again. 65 min: Norwood nicks the ball off Skipp in midfield and for a moment there seems a chance that he will run all the way through and fire off a shot. But Sanchez soon puts a stop to that far-out idea. 63 min: Jennings releases Caprice with a smart ball down the right. Caprice dashes forward and then tries a hopeful shot from 20 yards and a difficult angle. It drifts way wide.60 min: Gazzaniga gets his hands warmed by a long-range shot. “So how’s the giant-killing trope going then?” asks Ed Moloney. Forget the giant-killing, from here on in it’s all about finding out whether Serge Aurier is, in fact, the new Bunny Bell. Oh dear. Tranmere are unravelling. Son runs from inside his own half to the edge of the area before facing any challenge, and he eludes that easily before shooting calmly past the keeper.A lovely piece of control by Son at the edge of the box as he takes down a diagonal pass and then spins and sets up Aurier, who charges in from the right to hit a powerful low shot beyond the keeper and a defender on the line. Tranmere are toast now, and Aurier’s on a hat-trick!54 min: Gazzaniga sets up an attack with a precise long kick. Moura tries to dribbe around the out-rushing keeper, but Davies gets a vital touch with his trailing leg to take it off the attacker! 52 min: A long throw-in from the right if flicked on by Monthe. Foyth jumps with Norwood and heads it further into the six-yard box. It drops to Gilmour, who Gilmour, who lashes the bouncing ball just over the bar! Aurier flicks the ball through to Son, who skips past Monthe and into the box. He looks up from the byline and pulls the ball back to Llorente, who merely has to slot it into the net from six yards. Spurs are surely on Easy Street now.47 min: Monthe and McNulty combine to snuff out dangerous conniving between Alli and Moura on the edge of the Tranmere box."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e396de726b11ca9b8ef82db843098ffeaff1f7c8/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c90b4f557ef295d2ac9d4b6ccb26099","title":"poverty drives trade child brides zimbabwe","story":"Married off at 13, Maureen lost her education and her health. Her plight is common in a country racked by economic turmoilThe end of Maureen’s days at a primary school in north-eastern Zimbabwe marked the beginning of her life as a wife.At 13, the brightest student in her class in Mudzi, Mashonaland, she was married to a man three times her age.Her father, a poor farmer, had promised to fund Maureen’s secondary education but, when the time came, he could not raise the money. Marrying off his daughter was a quick fix. Maureen swiftly fell pregnant and was still 13 when she gave birth after spending hours in labour. The baby did not survive.Three years on and Maureen is at Chinhoyi provincial hospital. She is among the scores of underage brides being cared for here who are suffering from obstetric fistula, caused by prolonged labour.“I haven’t forgiven my parents for doing this to me. I had a bright future but now they treat me like an outcast,” says Maureen.“When my parents told me about the marriage I couldn’t believe it, because they had always given me the impression that I was their most intelligent child and I would pursue my studies. The man was abusive, he called me names and beat me several times, especially after I lost my baby,” she says. “My dreams were destroyed by that man.”Child marriage in Zimbabwe is often driven by poverty. Dowries offer a welcome, if brief, respite from penury in poor households struggling to weather a vicious economic crisis. The brides, though, are more likely to remain in a state of privation due to lack of personal development and education.Although underage marriage is illegal and local organisations have been fighting against it as an economic transaction, the financial meltdown has worsened the situation. About one in every three girls in Zimbabwe is married before the age of 18, the legal age of consent.According to campaign organisation Girls Not Brides, families see little worth in girls.“In many communities, economic opportunities are severely limited, especially for girls and women. Families therefore see little value in educating their daughters and instead marry them off to fulfil the role of a wife and mother,” says a Girls Not Brides spokesperson.Zimbabwe is facing an acute shortage of cash and, as basic commodities disappear from the shelves, families’ disposable income has been depleted.Kresi, 16, from Masvingo, is another teenager whose future was jeopardised when she was married off to a cattle farmer in her village. Her family received a dowry of two cows and a few groceries in exchange for Kresi. She also suffers from obstetric fistula, a hole between the genital tract and bladder or rectum caused by lengthy or obstructed labour.Women and girls who experience obstetric fistula suffer constant incontinence, shame, social segregation and further health problems. It is estimated that more than 2 million young women in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa live with the condition untreated.Tendai, 14, of Bindura says her family gave her away in exchange for 100 Zimbabwean dollars (22p).She was married to a man with three wives. As the youngest wife, Tendai is burdened with both child-bearing and work in the fields.“I still want to go back to school. I just hope my husband can give me that chance. But as the youngest wife I have to do everything here at home,” Tendai says.She is bitter over her parent’s decision to marry her off.With a drought looming and disposable incomes depleted from galloping inflation, poor families are more likely to exchange their daughter for very little.“In areas like Binga, Matabeleland, the dowry can be a goat, which is an insult to the value of the girl. In some instances families just leave their child at the man’s house to lessen their own burden,” says Grace Maunganidze, a local activist.Another activist, Abigail Mutema, blames child marriages on the stronghold of a patriarchal society.“Until women are emancipated, child marriages will never end. In some of the communities, girls as young as 16 are deemed too old, so they need to get married. There is nothing to do in the rural areas, so the easier route is to get married. Poverty plays a role in these child marriages,” says Mutema.“Older women have become perpetrators of these early child marriages. A woman is not complete without marriage, they say.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe06055a4fe07436c67c2f8eb2be615989339d7e/0_0_8000_4800/master/8000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e7a99823e90f8652a4d2acbff55ccf1","title":"more male tests needed in cases of repeated miscarriages uk study","story":"Imperial College scientists find DNA damage in sperm could be undetected cause Men should undergo tests when couples suffer repeated miscarriages, according to researchers who say the health of the man’s sperm may sometimes be a factor.The focus is usually on the woman’s body when multiple pregnancies fail, with tests usually looking for immune system problems or infection. But a small government-funded study by scientists at Imperial College London suggests miscarriage could also be a result of male issues, particularly if they are not routinely tested. “Traditionally, doctors have focused attention on women when looking for the causes of recurrent miscarriage. The men’s health – and the health of their sperm – wasn’t analysed,” said Dr Channa Jayasena, the lead author of the research, from Imperial’s department of medicine.“However, this research adds to a growing body of evidence that suggests sperm health dictates the health of a pregnancy. For instance, previous research suggests sperm has an important role in the formation of the placenta, which is crucial for oxygen and nutrient supply to the foetus.”The team tested 50 men whose partners had suffered recurrent miscarriages, defined as the loss of three consecutive pregnancies before 20 weeks’ gestation. All were patients at St Mary’s hospital, in London. The scientists analysed their sperm and compared the results with those of 60 similar male volunteers.The sperm of the men in the miscarriage group had twice as much DNA damage as that in the control group, they found. The researchers, writing in the journal Clinical Chemistry, say this could be down to reactive oxygen species – molecules formed by cells in semen to protect sperm from bacteria and infection. In high enough concentrations, the molecules can cause significant damage to sperm cells.The results from the study revealed sperm from men whose partners had suffered miscarriage had four times more of these molecules compared to the control group. The scientists are now investigating the cause.“Although none of the men in the trial had any ongoing infection such as chlamydia, which we know can affect sperm health, it is possible there may be other bacteria from previous infections lingering in the prostate gland, which makes semen. This may lead to permanently high levels of reactive oxygen species,” said Jayasena.Obesity can also cause fertility problems. Higher fat levels in the body could trigger an increase in reactive oxygen species.The men whose partners had suffered miscarriage were older than the other group, with an average age of 37 compared to 30, and were slightly more overweight. The team is now investigating whether these factors may have affected the levels of reactive oxygen species.Dr Kevin McEleny of the British Fertility Society said: “This is an interesting study that illustrates the importance of research into sperm quality. The results agree with some of the previous research into a link between DNA damage in sperm and miscarriage.“We know that the partners of older men are more likely to suffer miscarriage. The study group was generally older than the control group, which might go some way to explain the results.“The study picked up small differences in hormone levels it is not clear if these findings are of clinical relevance, because the average hormone levels of all groups were well within normal range. Minor differences in sperm quality were observed but the significance of that isn’t clear.”Jayasena concluded: “Although this is a small study, it gives us clues to follow. If we confirm in further work that high levels of reactive oxygen species in semen increase the risk of miscarriage, we could try to develop treatments that lower these levels and increase the chance of a healthy pregnancy.“It has taken medicine a long time to realise sperm health has a role to play in miscarriage and that the cause doesn’t lie solely with women. Now we realise both partners contribute to recurrent miscarriage, we can hopefully get a clearer picture of the problem and start to look for ways of ensuring more pregnancies result in a healthy baby.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca2181390546b6c27f17272e1b61cc87599f71fa/0_856_1695_1016/master/1695.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4caf646337db6b69ed4f5126f7143ffb","title":"my father was unfaithful how do i talk to him about it annalisa barbieri","story":"It is easy to vilify the one who has been unfaithful, says Annalisa Barbieri, but they are often firing a distress flare on a relationship that’s already in troubleMy parents orced when I was five. I still remember the night they sat me and my sisters down, and Dad told us that he and Mum didn’t love each other any more. I remember clinging on to his hand as he walked down the stairs on the day he left home, and afterwards crying to my mother late at night about how I missed him.I am now in my mid-20s. When I was a teenager, Mum told me they orced because he had been unfaithful. She said he had been under a lot of pressure at work, but that when her father died, she needed to support her mother, and my father felt he wasn’t getting the emotional help he needed.I have never spoken to him about this – so many years have passed – and I want to know how I should go about it now. He is a complex man – highly intelligent, but emotionally immature. My guess is he could quickly become defensive and angry. But I have been carrying my own feelings with me for most of my life, and think I deserve a proper explanation. He has never had to account for his behaviour to the one most affected by it, and that feels wrong. I’m also at the stage in life when I am considering becoming a father, and can’t understand how he could make a decision that would lead to him not seeing his own every day. He remarried years ago and has a daughter with his new wife (not the woman he was unfaithful with). I resent that he has another chance at a family life, while I still struggle with anxiety and insecurity, which may be caused by his abandonment of my sisters and me.I should add that he has always been part of my life, and I know he loves me and my sisters deeply. I am angry with him, but I also want to hear his perspective on what happened.I think what you are asking is understandable and admirable, but you need to approach it differently. Rather than looking for him to “account for his behaviour”, try to think of it as finding out more about your father. I can totally understand your motivation. But I want you to get a conversation going so you can get answers if you make him defensive, I fear you may feel even worse.It is easy to vilify the person who has been unfaithful, but it’s often they who are firing the distress flare on a relationship that is already in trouble. I think your mother has hinted at this. But your parents must take responsibility for their behaviour, and it sounds as if your mother was left behind to pick up the pieces. That she didn’t tell you the details until you were old enough to handle them is laudable. As you are getting older, perhaps you are realising that relationships are trickier than they seem when you are a child. I’m impressed you want to get another point of view on this, and are employing some critical thinking in a situation that clearly still causes you angst.You have asked me how to start this conversation unravelling family history and, perhaps, challenging what you think you know, is rarely a one-off event. These conversations take time, and require building up to.Of course your father doesn’t want to raise this. I would imagine he carries a lot of guilt. Start the conversation slowly, and when you are both at ease (side-by-side conversations often work best in these situations, rather than the intensity of face-to-face). You know your father best: when does he talk most openly (even if it’s relative)? Could you say something honest like, “I’d like to be a dad one day – what was it like for you when you first became a father?” and build up from there. As I said, it may take a few conversations. If your father becomes defensive and angry, then pause and say, “I can see this is causing you pain, but it’s causing me pain, too. How can we help each other?” But try not to be afraid of his anger and defensiveness – think of them as layers that you have to get through. It might be an idea to discuss what happened before you get into how it made you feel.I had a situation in my own family something that happened when I was the age you were when your father left. In the end I talked – over some years – to all but one of the people involved. Doing that really helped the adult me lift the child me out of the situation I had found myself in. What once burned a hole in my heart doesn’t touch me any more. I have simply folded it into my family history.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

In this typically understated nu-metal video, he distinguishes his manly moves by throwing down on a helipad (very dangerous!) and inviting viewers to celebrate the size of his ... steering wheel.The classic novelty single was inspired by distant climes whose locals, one imagines, wouldn’t be seen dead dancing to it. Sure, it ruined your school disco, but consider the plight of singer Dene Michael Betteridge, who was forced to perform the song’s lumpen moves when in jail for benefit fraud. “These terrifying criminals tell you to do something, you do it,” he said.The only way to get smooth, mullet-sporting Cyrus on traditional country radio was to play up his horndog status. A choreographer taught the distinctive line dance to the female fans who turned up for the video shoot, the label organised a dance contest and the 90s line-dancing fad was born (before dying with Steps’ monstrous 5, 6, 7, 8).If my bandmates ruined my wedding, I wouldn’t be inclined to accompany them to a disco and knock out a rinky-dink dance routine, but such is life in the video for Tragedy. The hands-by-the-ears dance moves could be likened to Edvard Munch’s The Scream, if you had lost your mind and critical faculties.REM challenged themselves to write this dumb bubblegum song, which swiftly became their second US Top 10 hit. Needing a video to match, the director, Katherine Dieckmann, determined to break down Michael Stipe’s “staid” public image with this mildly aerobic, entirely charming routine that provoked much playground copycatting. A lark, but a self-aware and not-unkind one.US rap spurs global viral dances, but the UK scene isn’t too shabby at it. Following Skepta’s Rolex Sweep and KIG’s Head, Shoulders, Kneez \u0026amp Toez, Gun Lean finds Russ performing his glitchy, lean-back bob in Sainsbury’s cereal aisle and moving embattled drill closer to the (snap, crackle and) pop mainstream.The Saturday Night dance didn’t originate with Whigfield, but by the time she performed the No 1 hit on Top of the Pops, the kinetic, bunny-hopping bop had become such a phenomenon that the Dane had no choice but to scowl as some talentless buffoons performed it around her. Its legacy endures in regional aqua aerobics classes.Perhaps the only video to feature Princess Diana, Gaddafi and the Statue of Liberty, whose limbs were computer-manipulated into mimicking the ancient Egyptian reliefs that inspired the song. On one hand, this two-arm movement couldn’t be easier on the other, the video reveals dozens of uncoordinated New Yorkers making an enjoyable hash of it.Who knew that Psy’s pony-king dance could do so much harm? It has led to deaths, rival gang shootouts, near-fatal LSD trips, conspiracy theories, fraudster arrests, Ed Balls’ spirited jockeying and illegal firecracker production. Not to mention all the slipped discs.Most of the moves detailed in Crank That are easily replicable – punching, starting a motorbike, the robot – hence its breakout success. But one element of the song mercifully didn’t go mainstream: namely the “Superman”, which Urban Dictionary details as the emission of a certain fluid that then dries into a cape-like layer. Grisly.The first global dance craze is a softer, desexualised version of a dance that stems back to 19th-century slaves and looks incredibly gentle today. Still, it provoked endearing bafflement among commentators at the time, who likened its “piston-like motions” to “baffled bird keepers fighting off a flock of attacking blue jays”.The Macarena has fallen on hard times: macarena is canvassing for donations to stay up and running. But the methodical dance to one of the biggest one-hit wonders will live on, at least until the last 90s kid who can do it in their sleep passes away. Hey!The “faces” of the New York disco scene that inspired Saturday Night Fever were uniquely stylish men (at least, in Nik Cohn’s fabricated Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night feature). But the beauty of the diagonal point-and-bob, so immaculately done by John Travolta, is that any drunk slob can pull it off with aplomb.Of all the moves in Single Ladies – the Bob Fosse-inspired routine that spawned a thousand high-end exercise classes, the finger-waggy “huh oh oh”s aimed at giving nans an easy bit to follow – none is as arresting as Beyoncé’s final pose as she audibly gasps for breath after nailing it.Some of pop history’s finest moments turn on a flash of recontextualisation that sticks for ever: the interview that recast the Spice Girls as Scary, Ginger and co an outraged Mike Read pulling Relax off air, stoking its notoriety. You can watch one happen when the Village People performed YMCA on Dick Clark’s American Bandstand in January 1979. The group hadn’t choreographed a dance, but the audience, mistaking the band’s raised arms in the chorus for a Y formation, invented one on the spot. Clark, agog, made everyone do it again immediately.

While the men behind Seaborne Freight might not have expected the level of scrutiny to which they are being subjected after landing a £14m government contract to ensure the flow of food and medical supplies in the event of a no-deal Brexit, what started life as another cross-Channel ferry service is suddenly in the spotlight.First came the revelation that the company had no ships. Next, it emerged terms and conditions on its website appeared to be intended for a food delivery business. Now, after dredging started on Thursday to prepare Ramsgate harbour for the service that Seaborne will run to the Belgian port of Ostend, the role of the self-described “old sea dogs” will be closely watched.Seaborne’s founder and chief operating officer is a veteran of the ferry industry and was involved in the controversial export of live cattle from the West Sussex port of Shoreham-by-Sea in the 1990s.Dudley, 64, a well-known figure in the Brighton area, was a director of International Trader’s Ferry, although a listing on Companies House features a different spelling of his name, Dydley. ITF, registered in 1995 in the British Virgin Islands, was formed by cattle farmers with the help of Dudley’s expertise as a “shipping consultant”, according to Companies House. Its plan was to export live calves to the continent to be slaughtered for veal.The trade was the subject of protests from animal rights campaigners, forcing local police to draft in more than 1,000 extra officers to enable the exports, which were legal, to continue. One protester was killed during clashes with police.So fraught was that period that Dudley even borrowed a shotgun to ward off protesters – and found himself imprisoned for two months for possessing it after police searched his home. A judge at Hove crown court told him: “This is not the wild west.”He said Seaborne had no plans to carry livestock out of Ramsgate.Eventually, the police withdrew their provision of security because of the high cost of protecting ITF. The company launched a lawsuit designed to reverse the decision and ensure continued protection at taxpayers’ expense, but was unsuccessful.As protests at Shoreham continued, ITF moved its export operation to Dover, but eventually fell victim to the BSE outbreak. The crisis brought an end to the export of cows from Britain to the continent from 1996, a ban that was not lifted until 2006.Dudley, who is believed to live in Dieppe, France, subsequently worked for MyFerryLink, a small cross-Channel service that was owned by Eurotunnel, as its freight and marketing manager.Speaking to Reuters in December, Dudley said: “For us, the harder the Brexit the better. If Dover and the Channel tunnel are encumbered, our space will go quite quickly.”The chief executive of Seaborne Freight is listed on the firm’s Companies House page as John Sharp, but told the  he had been known as Ben for most of his life, including by his family.He spent 10 years as a submarine officer in the Royal Navy before setting up a shipping company that ultimately ran aground. Mercator, a ship chartering company, was forced into liquidation by HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs in 2014 because it was unable to pay a sizeable tax bill. It was not disclosed how much Mercator owed HMRC, but it left a total of £1.78m in unpaid debts. Sharp said Mercator collapsed after a client in the Middle East failed to pay its bills.He later set up another ship operating company, Albany Shipping, but he said this business was put to one side after he was asked to get involved with Seaborne Freight.After details of Seaborne’s contract emerged, Sharp, 61, said he was confident the company would be ready to run a ferry service from Ramsgate to Ostend by the end of March. Described in the shipping media as a veteran of the ferry industry, he began his career with the marine operations of the French state-owned rail company SNCF and was the chief executive of Seaborne before Sharp joined. According to Companies House, he remains a director of the company and lives in France.Like Dudley, he used to work for MyFerryLink. The business, which operated two ships, was sold to rival DFDS in 2017 amid a monopoly investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority into whether Eurotunnel should be allowed to run cross-Channel ships.Other directors in the company include Peter Hampton Blackmore, a solicitor, and Brian Raincock, an insurance consultant and a director in Albany Shipping alongside Sharp. Both Raincock and Blackmore work for London-based LML, which funds and insures group litigation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4dd966a45e76ee8991a4c868800266044571eec/0_212_2320_1392/master/2320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e49570195ae58a7b377ee7429d9e494","title":"labour confirms expulsion of convicted mp fiona onasanya","story":"Party says MP who lied to avoid speeding charge was ousted before ChristmasLabour would actively seek to trigger a byelection in the Peterborough seat held by Fiona Onasanya if the party’s former MP received a sentence of less than 12 months having being found guilty of lying to police to avoid a speeding charge.The party’s chairman, Ian Lavery, said Onansanya had been expelled from the party and that officials were waiting on the outcome of her sentencing, due later this month, before taking the next steps.Onasanya would automatically lose her seat if she received a sentence of 12 months or more, even if some of it was suspended. But if she were to receive a shorter custodial sentence, a recall petition would automatically be triggered.In an interview with the Peterborough , Lavery added: “You voted for a Labour party person. Unfortunately the people of Peterborough were failed. We want a Labour party MP here who will do the people of Peterborough a great service.”Lavery’s remarks and Onasanya’s expulsion mean that it is almost certain a byelection will take place in a seat Labour took by 607 votes in 2017, forcing out Stewart Jackson, who had held the seat for the Conservatives for 12 years.Onasanya would be able to stand as a candidate if a recall petition was successfully triggered, but not for Labour as she has been thrown out, in a seat where the Tories will also fancy their chances.Lavery said: “Fiona isn’t a member of the Labour party – she isn’t a Labour MP.” He repeated the party’s call for her to resign her seat, adding: “We would be raring to go for a byelection.

In a column in the Peterborough  over Christmas, Onasanya indicated she would continue as an MP.Making no mention of her conviction, she said constituents should “rest assured” that she would remain their representative fighting injustice in the corridors of power.Shortly after the conviction, Onasanya sent a message to parliamentary colleagues on a WhatsApp group, likening her predicament to those of biblical figures, including Jesus, who had been found guilty by the courts of their day, and asking them to pray for her.In her trial, the court was told she was sent a notice of intended prosecution to fill out, but it was sent back naming the guilty driver as Aleks Antipow, an acquaintance of Festus who was away visiting his parents in Russia.Festus pleaded guilty to three counts of perverting the course of justice, including the 24 July incident."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9c773fd9728290a0d53284bf4b7401dc2aec48e/0_21_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb2313f1dc17823d7b28c40b2d71b297","title":"may to begin fresh round of brexit phone talks with eu leaders","story":"No 10 refuses to provide details of call, with PM battling to obtain assurances on backstopTheresa May has spoken to Jean-Claude Juncker as part of her effort to obtain further written reassurances that the Irish border backstop in her Brexit deal would never come into force.The phone call between the prime minister and the European commission president on Friday was described by Brussels as “friendly” but Downing Street refused to provide any further details, as May struggles to break the Brexit impasse.She is still hoping to obtain additional clarifications over the backstop before MPs vote on the deal in the week of 14 January, although it is not clear what May can get that would satisfy Tory rebels and the Democratic Unionist party.A backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal. As a result, the EU insists on having its own backstop - the backstop to the backstop - which would mean Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, which props up her government. That prompted May to propose a country-wide alternative in which the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the customs union after Brexit. “The EU still requires a ‘backstop to the backstop’ – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,” May told MPs. Raising the stakes, the prime minister said the EU’s insistence amounted to a threat to the constitution of the UK: “We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom,” she added.Expectations are being kept deliberately low, and May is likely to begin the political year talking about the long-term future of the NHS on BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.May has recently spoken to the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. The discussions were initially confirmed by the offices of Tusk and Merkel. No 10 will not otherwise say who the prime minister has spoken to, unless the counterpart does so first.A European commission spokeswoman described the call between Juncker and May as friendly” and said they “agreed to stay in touch next week” when Westminster returns from its Christmas break and the debate on the meaningful vote will restart.The Commons will discuss May’s Brexit deal on Wednesday after prime minister’s questions, continuing on Thursday and possibly Friday. The final vote, pulled last month after the prime minister admitted she would lose by a “significant margin”, is due to follow in the middle of the week following.Time is narrowing for May’s deal to be approved before 29 March, because once MPs agree in principle, ratification legislation will have to be voted through by parliament, a process that normally takes months.Failure to agree would mean the UK would crash out without a deal, and it would be difficult for MPs to force the government into proposing an alternative. But ministers would need to pass dozens of items of emergency legislation. Labour has said it would seek to introduce amendments that would make no deal difficult to implement.Downing Street had hoped Brexit passions would have cooled over the Christmas break as warnings mount about the potential impact of no deal, but the early signs are that rebel positions remain firm and the vote is expected to be lost.It is believed there are 30-40 Tory MPs deemed certain to vote against May’s deal, including former cabinet ministers and veteran anti-EU campaigners, although that would be a significant reduction from the 100 who publicly declared their opposition in December.The DUP, whose 10 MPs help keep May in power, has been repeating its objections to the proposed Brexit arrangement over the past 24 hours, despite continuing talks with No 10 to try to resolve the impasse.Sammy Wilson, the DUP’s Brexit spokesman, said his party opposed the backstop because if it came into force, Northern Ireland “would have to treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country” and would not participate in any trade deals that the UK may enter into in the future.Downing Street has floated the idea of staging a second parliamentary vote almost immediately after the first in an attempt to pressure MPs to change their minds, in a crisis atmosphere of rising public concern and jittery financial markets.The argument is helped by May’s position being more secure than it was in December after rebel MPs failed to unseat her. Under Conservative party rules, she cannot be challenged again for nearly a year.Labour has repeatedly called for May to step aside if her deal is voted down, but she could only be forced out if she were defeated in a Commons vote of no confidence. Rebel Tories have said they would not vote with Labour in such a situation.EU sources said on Friday they did not know what May was aiming for with her round of holiday telephone diplomacy. “That is still not clear,” said one diplomat, adding that the “surgical removal” of the backstop demanded by some Eurosceptics was “not remotely possible”.A call by the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, for the EU to define the temporary nature of the backstop is not seen as realistic. “Define it how?” the diplomat said. “It can’t be a unilateral departure from the backstop and it can’t be time-limited. All of this tends to run around in circles.”Meanwhile, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, told a group of European newspapers that EU leaders could not hope to push May into organising a second referendum because it would inflame political tensions.“The extent to which Britain is ided currently is small compared with the tensions a second vote would cause. It would continue to split our nation,” Barclay said, in remarks first reported by Germany’s Die Welt.The minister said it would not be possible to hold a referendum before the EU parliamentary elections, due in May, and if Britons had to vote for MEPs again, he predicted there would be “huge democratic damage, because the citizens voted to quit”.Barclay even signalled that holding European elections in such a context could lead to a surge in support for Ukip or other anti-EU populists. “Even our European colleagues cannot be interested in it because that would trigger a very populist reaction,” Barclay said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/881a39e37b589718137809118e4b0a1e459f10af/0_2349_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf9791ed7511fdf727d7e1ef618fa6db","title":"half of people who think they have a food allergy do not study","story":"US study finds some people needlessly avoid foods while others do not have life-saving medicationThe number of adults who think they have a food allergy is almost double the figure who actually have one, research has revealed.While the study was conducted in the US, experts say a similar situation is also seen in other countries, including the UK. The researchers found that many people with an allergy do not have a prescription for potentially life-saving medication, while others might be avoiding foods unnecessarily.“This is really concerning because chances are they could eat the food and then all of a sudden they have a reaction to a food that they could previously tolerate – so what changed in their environment or in them that caused them to now develop this food allergy?” said Ruchi Gupta, a professor of paediatrics at Northwestern University and a co-author of the research. Gideon Lack, a professor of paediatric allergy at King’s College London, who was not involved in the research, said the growing problem of food allergies in adults might be linked to the dramatic rise seen in children over the past 20 years.“We have been focusing efforts and concerns about food allergy in children, and this study is telling us there is a very significant burden of food-allergic disease in adults and we ought to be directing more attention and resources towards diagnosing and treating those adults,” he said.Writing in the journal Jama Network Open, researchers in the US describe how they conducted a survey in two groups of participants between October 2015 and September 2016. In total more than 40,000 adults in the US took part.Participants were asked if they had a food allergy and were questioned about their reactions and diagnoses. The team then assessed whether the reported allergy, whether diagnosed or not, was “convincing” – for example if the participant had experienced symptoms such as throat tightening or vomiting.“If they only had, say, bloating or stomach pain or diarrhoea then we took them out because that could be a lactose intolerance or a food intolerance,” said Gupta.“There are so many adults out there who have a negative reaction to a food. It is really important to get a proper diagnosis so that they can really know is this something treatable like lactose intolerance, or is this a life-threatening food allergy that they need to be very careful with,” said Gupta.Prof Clare Mills, an expert in food allergies at the University of Manchester, welcomed the study but said it had limitations, including relying on self-reported data, including for symptoms. What’s more, she said, the healthcare system in the US is very different to the UK, meaning access to healthcare, and even the way adrenaline is prescribed, is very different. Stephen Till, a professor of allergy at King’s College London, said the prevalence of “true” allergies seen in the study seemed surprisingly high, but the widespread misapprehension of having an allergy chimed with his clinical experience in the UK.“I often see patients who think that they have a severe allergy who either aren’t allergic or who have mild allergy. They may have been unnecessarily prescribed adrenaline auto-injectors and be on a restricted diet avoiding even trace exposure to the suspected culprit,” he said, noting that this could cause significant anxiety and difficulties. “Unfortunately … we have a shortage of physicians who are trained in adult allergy and so this amplifies these kinds of problems.”﻿"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d042096a32e60010d7433f1786aec6ecdf237ac4/160_0_5625_3376/master/5625.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acdf029042196c41ef61504bcb9187ac","title":"vaping by young people remains burning issue health experts","story":"Despite much debate in UK and US there is still little agreement over how safe e-cigarettes areSifting through contradictory evidence is common when it comes to choosing the right thing to do to improve our health, not least at new year when many of us promise to leave old habits behind and make a fresh start. One topic that is almost guaranteed to provoke arguments is e-cigarettes. Thousands of research papers have been published about these devices over the past decade. But we do not seem to be much closer to a global consensus on their risks or benefits, and arguably the debate is becoming more entrenched. What is going on?A number of factors appear to be fuelling this, but in 2018 one more than any other seemed to be driving the debate. It relates to the consequences of e-cigarette use by young people, and the extent that youth vaping will lead to smoking. In other words: are e-cigarettes creating a new generation of nicotine users, and will these vapers become the smokers of the future?Scientists and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic pondered the evidence on these questions in 2018 and came to different conclusions. In the US, the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine reported that “there is substantial evidence that e-cigarette use increases risk of ever using combustible tobacco cigarettes among youth and young adults”. Advice from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention says: “E-cigarettes are not safe for youth, young adults, pregnant women or adults who do not currently use tobacco products.”In the UK, an updated evidence review from Public Health England concluded: “E-cigarettes are attracting very few young people who have never smoked into regular use, and e-cigarettes do not appear to be undermining the long-term decline in cigarette smoking in the UK among young people.” In addition, a House of Commons science and technology committee report stated: “Concerns about the risk of e-cigarettes potentially providing a ‘gateway’ into conventional smoking have not materialised to any significant degree.”Differing policies may also help explain these differences. In the UK, almost all forms of e-cigarette marketing have been banned since 2016. This is not the case in the US. In addition, newer devices appear to be popular with young Americans. These include Juul, which are small, discreet, easy to use and deliver nicotine more rapidly than older models, and have only recently become available in the UK. The EU also imposes limits on the amount of nicotine in e-cigarettes, controls not in place in the US.Attitudes to nicotine also differ. The UK has official guidance on tobacco harm reduction that recognises nicotine is not the harmful substance in tobacco (it is the thousands of other chemicals in cigarettes) and nicotine replacement therapy is licensed for use in smokers who are pregnant or children above the age of 12. In the US, the statement that nicotine harms the developing brain (evidence that comes from studies with mice and rats, not humans) is widely used in official documents. This means any e-cigarette use by American youth, even experimentation, is viewed as a cause for concern.Evidence from the US and UK combined indicates that efforts to deter teenagers from trying vaping may discourage adult smokers from using e-cigarettes to quit smoking. Fortunately, in both countries smoking rates continue to decline for both adults and young people, a fact often forgotten amid the furore about e-cigarettes. If e-cigarettes were a gateway to tobacco, these trends would stall or be reversed. And in the UK at least, government agencies and leading charities actively support vaping as a positive choice for smokers trying to stop.We should not be forced to choose between protecting children and supporting the one in two adult smokers who will suffer and die prematurely from a smoking-related disease if they continue to smoke. The challenge in 2019 and beyond will be to ensure the right balance is struck.Prof Linda Bauld is professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, deputy director of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, and holds the Cancer Research UK (CRUK)Bupa chair in behavioural research for cancer prevention at CRUK.Dr Suzi Gage is a lecturer at the University of Liverpool.

On a night when the Saracens forward Billy Vunipola marked his comeback from injury with a well-taken opening try and played the full 80 minutes it was the hosts who were celebrating a famous, third successive Premiership victory.On New Year’s Day Sale’s embattled director of rugby, Steve Diamond, declared his ambition to compete for trophies again. Putting Saracens, the defending champions, to the sword suggested his desire has substance. Not much has gone right for Sale since their memorable 2006 Premiership final win over Leicester at Twickenham. But this hard-earned victory, chiselled on aggression and two delightful first-half tries, was rapturously received by Diamond and his men.“We’ve beaten the best team in the country and you have to bully them into it sometimes,” Diamond said with a mischievous smile after Sale’s mere second win over Saracens in the last eight years. “But we’ve been playing well and I embrace the challenge of playing in this competition. I think ‘can we turn them over?’ and with the players we’ve got, believing in what we’re doing, we’re doing all right.”Vunipola was making his first appearance since breaking his left arm during a European Champions Cup win at Glasgow on 14 October. In the seventh minute he opened the scoring when he collected a pass from Alex Goode and evaded four Sale defenders to touch down in the left corner.Sale responded with two tries in five minutes midway through the first half. First the homegrown centre Sam James broke from midfield and found Denny Solomona on the right flank before gratefully receiving the winger’s inside pass to scamper clear.It got even better for Sale five minutes later when the scrum-half Faf de Klerk, who beavered away frenziedly all night, seized possession from a lineout. His deft pass found the ubiquitous James who had the presence of mind to return the favour to Solomona racing clear on a diagonal run inside the right channel from around 50 metres out.A yellow card for Owen Farrell following a high shot on his England teammate Chris Ashton in the 35th minute added to the belief that it could be the hosts’ night. Tempers flared as the hour approached, with Saracens’ lock George Kruis and the Sale captain, Jono Ross, squaring up in a spat which also involved Richard Wigglesworth, the former Sharks man. It underlined how much the game meant to both sides as chances grew scarce and tensions mounted.Emphatic proof that Sale really had got under their visitors’ skin came with 20 minutes remaining. Saracens’ replacement hooker Christopher Tolofua became the second visiting player to be sent to the sin-bin when he caught Arron Reed off the ball. After dissent from Farrell saw him concede a penalty moments later, Du Preez’s boot finished off Saracens amid scenes of euphoria, before Nick Tompkins’ last-minute consolation lifted the visitors top.Saracens’ director of rugby, Mark McCall, said: “Billy did quite well but we just got the fundamentals wrong tonight.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2b6ef92873e9b1dbf30d1ec58b5d326a837ed5a/0_128_3828_2297/master/3828.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c462cb5141e702b39d4ea75ad412468","title":"australia v india scg fourth test day three  live","story":"24th over: Australia 76-1 (Harris 49, Labuschagne 0) Harris strikes with the middle of his bat for the umpteenth time this morning, to the sweeper at point. This is his best chance yet to make his way to a maiden Test ton, make no mistake. Labuschagne plays the remainder of the Kuldeep over carefully. “He’s a very good player of spin,” notes Ricky Ponting. He’ll need to be, Kuldeep is a star (and my fave, as you can probably tell).Superb areas, Gaz. I’m going to re-write the Julia Stiles poem at lunch. 23rd over: Australia 75-1 (Harris 48, Labuschagne 0) I was about to type “this could turn into Australia’s best session of the series” or something like that when Khawaja fell. There are people getting stuck into him online, and I get that, but it was the delivery that did him. It brings Labuschagne, to the middle at number three for Australia. Imagine saying that twelve months ago. He’s on strike to Bumrah after Harris adds a couple through square leg then a single to point. The new man cops an inswinging yorker first up, just keeping it out via bat and boot! Welcome! At the end of the over he joins Harris for a laugh in the middle of the pitch, looking at the bottom of his bat that saved him from a first baller. Phew. Fantastic bowling, Khawaja done by the Kuldeep wrong’un! He was on the front foot trying to score through cover but didn’t pick the one that goes the other way, the miscue ending up with Pujara for an easy catch at cover. What classy, accurate bowling that is.21st over: Australia 70-0 (Harris 44, Khawaja 26) Jadeja has been taken off after just those three overs, Bumrah back from the Randwick End. Harris is forced to play throughout, getting down well to a slower ball before pushing another one to mid-on. He’s doing just as Chris Rogers says a busy opener must, turning the board over as often as possible with singles. Khawaja keeps the strike with one into midwicket to finish.20th over: Australia 68-0 (Harris 43, Khawaja 25) Harris is again on the front foot scoring, taking one early in the Kuldeep over to mid-on. The spinner was instrumental in India’s series-winning victory at Dharamsala in 2017, on debut no less. He may be India’s third choice spinner for now, but he has a long, long career ahead of him. Mindful of this, no doubt, Khawaja watches the rest of the accurate set respectfully.19th over: Australia 67-0 (Harris 42, Khawaja 25) Australia are going at better than four an over so far this morning, helped by Khawaja getting into his reverse sweep posture for the first time today, nailing it too for four more. When he was playing this shot a year ago it was seen as a sign of weakness, now it is one of his most dependable. For evidence, see how well he played it in Dubai during his fourth innings epic.18th over: Australia 61-0 (Harris 41, Khawaja 20) Spin from both ends, Kuldeep replacing Shami from the Paddington End. On telly, Tim Lane describes him as a left-arm over the wrist bowler, which will doubtless inspire feral comments about him being a snowflake or some such - what a world we live in. The runs keep coming after Harris sizes him up, carving a couple out to point then getting on the front foot to pick out that same sweeper for two more to finish. Into the 40s he moves. Go you good thing. 17th over: Australia 57-0 (Harris 37, Khawaja 20) Are these two Hayden and Langer in disguise? Two more boundaries in this over, the 50 stand brought up with another cover driven boundary from Harris, later in the over Khawaja jumping down the track to hammer Jadeja over mid-off for four more! That’s entertainment!16th over: Australia 47-0 (Harris 32, Khawaja 15) This is some excellent batting, Khawaja getting into position early to flick a boundary to fine leg with that lovely lift of the back foot when contact is made. Harris is better again, capping the over with a perfect cover drive. No need to run for that. Have a breather, I’d suggest, Mr Shami. “Mon cher Adam.” Why, it’s Bob Wilson dropping us a line from Paris. Good evening over there, comrade. “Many thanks to the LemonCroftCollins trio for a really smooth OBO run in the last couple of games. Good areas. I love this series like a child or a puppy. It’s been a vintage squeeze. I get the current Australian sackcloth and ashes routine about this team but I think these Indians have been remarkable. The almost imperceptible increase in their grip on this has been a thing of beauty. We all love the hack and thump of dizzyingly macho mental disintegration but this lot have executed the most gradual schlonking I’ve ever seen. They have poached you like jellyfish in a jacuzzi. It’s like a romcom with a bodycount.” I can’t add to that. Superb. A romcom with a bodycount, a new turn for Paul Rudd? 15th over: Australia 36-0 (Harris 28, Khawaja 8) Jadeja is on, and there is a dropped catch from the first ball of his spell! Well, Rahul didn’t quiteget to it at mid-on, but he should have. After talking up Harris, he’s played the false stroke, sounding ugly off his bat,, but he survives. He does well later in the over, keeping his cool after his reprieve to drive through cover from the balls of his feat, out to the rope for four. 14th over: Australia 32-0 (Harris 24, Khawaja 8) Lovely again from Harris, the second time this morning he has driven down the ground with control, albeit only for one this time. Even so, this might be the best we’ve seen him look for Australia so far. Khawaja then flicks a couple, watching the rest carefully. Not a bad start at all from the openers. “Morning Adam.” Kim Thonger! How goes you? “I fully expect Australia to bat well on this pitch. They might even declare, on either 567 for 8 or 678 for 9, ah but no I’m English, so by their scoring method perhaps it will be 4 for 567 or 5 for 678. If they reach 6 for 789 though, I’ll eat my trilby. I’ve confused myself now, so I shall stop.” Gosh, the last time Australia declared? Possibly at this ground 12 months ago? Some niche work is required to take this further: the longest time between Australian declarations? Thankfully, I have Geoff Lemon to my right and Ben Jones from CricViz to my left. They live for tasks like this.13th over: Australia 29-0 (Harris 23, Khawaja 6) Bumrah versus is shaping up as a tasty little contest, the Indian seamer building up up his pace through the over at the Aussie opener. Some good Test cricket early in the day here.12th over: Australia 29-0 (Harris 23, Khawaja 6) It’s Shami from the Paddington End, running away from us. Harris uses the pace well, timing a defensive push to cover to pick up one early in the over. Khawaja is using his bat in defence for the rest, getting one to mid-on to keep the strike.11th over: Australia 27-0 (Harris 22, Khawaja 5) Shot! First ball of the day, Bumrah overpitches to Harris to leans into a lovely off-drive for three. Khawaja is immediately under pressure with a delivery slipping past his blade and into his pad but by the end of the over he is leaving confidently. Out come the teams for their pink cap presentation. The Australians and Indians file past Glenn McGrath to present him with their baggy pinks, which are no in turn popped online to help with today’s huge fundraising task. To the middle they continue to begin day three. Bumrah has the ball in his hand, Australia resuming at 24-0 with Harris (19), there with Khawaja (5) PLAY!  One of the joys about writing at the SCG is the half hour or so when the sun is setting over the back of the Members and Ladies Stands. Here was my vantage point last night. I don’t like much about Sydney, but I do like this.“Welcome to the hot seat, Collins!” Good morning to you, Raakesh Natraj. “Tim Paine, top bloke. Wonder how long he’ll hang on to the captaincy after the return of Smith and Warner? Would like him to go on.”Well, in practical terms, it’ll be at least April 2020 before Smith is eligible to lead again - they banned him for two years from captaincy gigs. There’s no reason to pension off Paine any time soon, for mine. If anything, this whole episode reinforces how unfortuante it is that Paine wasn’t able to lead this side earlier. If we knew what we knew. Yes, his finger was cooked for years, but by the time Smith took over, Paine was very much back in business. Ah well.When he does finish up, Cummins is the man for me. In 818 Tests that Australia has played, only one has been led by a quick. Ridiculous. Pat: It’s on!Righto, I’m now upstairs. The ground is looking a treat and it is already hot, with a forecast top of 35 degrees in Sydney today. There will be no complaints given that during this fixture last year it reached 47. Have that. To the enormous credit of Tim Paine, he fronted the press conference at stumps last night. Better still, he maintained a great sense of humour, especially when a colleague’s phone went off on the table. Nicely played. Today is Jane McGrath Day. The Pink Test has been an important part of the SCG Test over the last decade, raising money to support Breast Care nurses across Australia. If you’re so inclined, this is a good day to throw some money the McGrath Foundation’s way. Another smashing day in the harbour city, not a cloud to be seen. Now, there are days in the dirt and then there are days in the dirt and Australia certainly experienced one of the latter on Friday. That was quite brutal yesterday afternoon as India’s lower order got busy, Pant’s unbeaten 159 a real wonder.Without any realistic hope of winning the Test from here, the job for the hosts is to find a way to bat for a full day for the top order to make the most of these favourable conditions to show that some lessons were learned in Melbourne. I’m looking forward to your company through the first session before Geoff Lemon and JP Howcroft stop by later to drive the OBO home. What do you think? Is this the day Travis Head or Marcus Harris post three figures for the first time? Does Usman Khawaja put on a clinic? Or will it all come tumbling down? Drop me a line, ping me a tweet - you know the drill.

As a gay man of colour he didn’t fit the everyday indie rock frontman mould – he shattered it. As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we look at his extraordinary influence. Images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Laura McCluskeyNobody could accuse Kele Okereke of standing still. Following the release of his acclaimed 2017 solo effort, Fatherland, he’s spent the second half of this year on a sold-out international tour with his band Bloc Party, who are revisiting their beginnings by performing their seminal debut album, Silent Alarm, in its entirety. Meanwhile, he’s somehow found time to co-compose the score for the highly anticipated new musical Leave to Remain, which opens at the Lyric Hammersmith in January, with songwriter Matt Jones.And while his professional life continues to metamorphosise, his personal life has also taken on a new dimension as he, along with his partner, welcomed a baby girl into their lives. They called her Savannah. When I interviewed Okereke for Attitude magazine last year, I reminded him that he’d once proclaimed that his solo album came about because all his bandmates wanted to stop and have babies, but he wanted to wait until he was 35.“Did I say that? Wow!” he said. “I’ve always wanted to be a father, but as a gay man I didn’t know if it was possible.”While being a gay parent in the UK these days isn’t exactly a revolutionary act, back in the mid-noughties a queer black singer fronting an indie rock band was nothing short of extraordinary. This was a scene dominated by straight white men where a certain type of swaggering masculinity was the default, yet here was a softly spoken, soulful gay man whose band was leading the race.Even though Okereke himself didn’t formally come out until his solo career took off, during Bloc Party’s reign his queerness was hiding in plain sight. He was never a flamboyant performer in the Freddie Mercury mould, and he didn’t openly embrace his sexuality the way a new generation of queer singers including Olly Alexander, Troye Sivan and Hayley Kiyoko would come to do. But his tender masculinity and softly coded lyrics spoke volumes.As a young, gay, indie music fan myself, who was many years away from landing the job of deputy editor of Attitude, I can attest to the importance of seeing someone like Okereke up on stage back then. And even though he might have been deliberately singing ambiguously, when Okereke launched into I Still Remember, from sophomore album A Weekend In The City, the queer intent was clear. The song is about two teenage lovers, both too afraid to make a move (“You should have asked me for itI would have been brave”). Here was someone who saw the world differently, here was someone like me.Fast forward 11 years and there’s nothing coded about Okereke now, or the songs he sings. On Fatherland he duets with Years \u0026amp Years’s Olly Alexander, on a track called Grounds for Resentment. “It’s the first time I’ve ever sung a romantic duet with another boy, and that’s important,” he says. “I feel, as a gay singer, you can fall into the trap of thinking we’re not really allowed to express desire. That as a gay man singing about love and desire, everything has to be coded.”That trap has opened wide now and Okereke can proudly count himself among a legion of queer musicians whose sexuality is everyday, yet still extraordinary.Okereke’s boundless musical curiosity has since seen him move into theatre as he scores a highly anticipated new play, out early 2019. Leave to Remain tells the story of a gay couple whose marriage forces two very different families to come together.While it’s clear that Okereke’s not short of projects to give his attention to, his primary focus for the foreseeable future is his own family. When I asked him if he has any doubts about raising his daughter as a gay parent he’s firm in his response: “We’re going to do all that we can to make sure she has the strength to stand in her own convictions,” he says. “That’s how I’ve lived my life. I’ve had to go out and be myself in spite of what everyone was telling me.”Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14497a5958db93459ccc506a6a1a4849658c4fdc/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b48f901e1546c95660860feb6086db66","title":"bitcoin after 10 wild years what next for cryptocurrencies","story":"From next no value in 2009, it rose to $20,000 and crashed back to $3,000 within a decade Two years after its inception, 10,000 bitcoin was just about enough to buy a couple of takeaway pizzas. Today those bitcoin would be worth nearly $38m (£30m). That is a huge increase, but just a fraction of their $180m value only 13 months ago, because since its creation a decade ago this week, the digital currency has been at the centre of one of the biggest economic bubbles in history.Bitcoin has had a wild ride since its birth on 3 January 2009. Created as a digital currency to sidestep the traditional finance industry using encrypted code, it took until May 2010 for the first reported purchase using bitcoin to take place: those two large Papa John’s pizzas worth $30 for 10,000 bitcoins.But in recent years bitcoin has become less useful as a medium of exchange and more famous for its boom-bust tendencies – drawing parallels to the Dutch tulip mania of 1637 and Dante’s Inferno for its ability to lose investors millions of pounds.Nouriel Roubini, one of the few economists to predict the 2008 financial crash and a former White House economic adviser is one of Bitcoin’s most vocal critics. He has called it the “mother of all bubbles” and tweeted last month that it,and other crypto copycats like Ethereum and Litecoin, should be ranked in a “2018 Shitcoin HallPile of Manure Shame”.But despite the cautionary warnings from mainstream economists, as well as the finance industry labelling bitcoin a vehicle for scammers, crooks and terrorists, there are still legions of cryptocurrency fans, with an online cottage industry of news websites, blogs and podcasts.The digital currency launched as more than just an opportunity for investors to make millions (before losing them almost equal amounts). The technology underlying it has excited businesses, while the growth of cryptocurrencies promised another future for its fans outside the traditional financial system.At its launch a decade ago, the very first block of bitcoin was etched with a subversive statement: “The Times 03Jan2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”The message from its creator – an unknown person or group of people going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto – was clear: bitcoin would exist outside of a system that had failed badly and could no longer be trusted.The idea came straight from the Austrian school of economics with a pinch of left-wing anarchism thrown in for good measure – offering inidual liberty and a way to avoid the grasp of government, while sidestepping corporate power and the banking system.The birth of the digital currency represented a return to the days of private money in the earlier stages of western economic development, with a parallel to wildcat banks in the mid 19th century as the US expanded westward, when railway companies and construction firms issued thousands of banknotes between them.Scores of bitcoin copycats have emerged, hoping to ride the wave of euphoria evident in 2017, launched through initial coin offerings (ICOs) that in several cases turned out to be fraudulent scams.As with the age of private money, which led governments to create monopolies over currency under the auspices of the central banking system, in order to gain state control and to protect consumers from firms and iniduals unable to repay the holders of their notes, bitcoin also appears to be heading for a more tightly regulated future.The UK government is poised to give sweeping new powers over digital currencies to the Financial Conduct Authority, after MPs warned that it and other cryptocurrencies were akin to the “wild west” and exposed consumers to various risks. Central banks including the Bank of England are examining cryptocurrencies, while some countries have looked to create their own.Despite losing some investors millions of pounds, the bitcoin boom and bust has also attracted attention to its underlying technology – the blockchain – which may be used to revolutionise the way companies handle payments or transfer information.Kiran Nagaraj of the accountancy firm KPMG said company executives increasingly ask about how they can use digital currencies or blockchain technology. “Credit to bitcoin, it created an awareness. The 2018 bear market will help create better quality services and products for the whole space overall,” he said.There are fears however that the institutional wave of investors that rushed to buy cryptocurrencies last year may slowly melt away. JP Morgan has warned that more professionals are ditching bitcoin than investing. After the launch of bitcoin futures on the Chicago Board Options Exchange a year ago – viewed by enthusiasts as its arrival in the mainstream – trading interest has slumped.Wild estimates were made for the future value of bitcoin a year ago. John McAfee, the software security company founder, predicted it would reach $500,000 by the end of 2020. The Winklevoss twins, who have invested significant sums in bitcoin, argued it could end up matching gold in value, meaning a price above $320,000 and total market capitalisation of at least $4tn.The argument went that prices only exist for any given asset because society agrees it is worth that amount, and why should bitcoin be any different, even if it lacks physical properties. But while gold also has limited utility to justify its value, unlike bitcoin the precious metal has been held in high regard for millennia.At the start of its 10th year, predictions for Bitcoin’s future are modest. Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at the currency trading firm Oanda, is moderately optimistic: “A bit of risk is still in the air but I’m starting to warm up to the upside now … we could see $5,000 and even a push to $6,000 on a convincing enough break of the key $5,000 mark.”Clement Thibault, senior analyst at Investing, reckons investor confidence has been shot for the time being: “I believe too many would-be early adopters got burned badly last year, and once an asset has been labeled a bubble, a gamble, or a speculative investment, it takes time to rebuild the trust and appeal needed to push the asset forward.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps. We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

But it remains one of the poorest places in the world, racked by war and disease and with massive inequality. In the east, where scores of militia commanders battle for control of mines, an outbreak of Ebola has killed more than 300. Across the country, aid agencies estimate that 4.3 million people are displaced.\u0026nbspIt is still recovering from a civil war triggered by the fall of the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, in which 4 million people died. Joseph Kabila has been in power as president since his father, the victor of that conflict, was shot dead in 2001.The country’s problems have been exacerbated by the refusal of Kabila to leave power after the end of his second mandate two years ago, which is why December’s much-delayed election was invested with so much hope and trepidation.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDRC has never known a peaceful transition of power since its hasty independence from Belgium in 1960. Chaos at polling stations on the day of the vote and a block on internet connections and SMS services\u0026nbspsince have severely dampened hopes that the election would bring a measure of political stability.The Catholic church, which sent more than 40,000 observers to polling stations across the country, said it knew who the winner was, urging the national electoral commission (CENI) to publish the result.It stopped short of giving the winner’s name, as this is illegal in the DRC, but several observers said it signalled that Shadary had lost.“We call on the CENI, as an institution supporting democracy, to respect truth and justice, taking full responsibility as it publishes election results,” the national episcopal conference of Congo (Cenco) said in a statement.The results of the election on 30 December are due on Sunday, but the electoral commission has indicated that delays are likely.The government has cut internet access and blocked SMS messaging, as well as blocking the signals of two broadcasters and withdrawing a French correspondent’s accreditation, in what Angela Quintal, of the Committee to Protect Journalists, called a “systematic campaign of censorship”.The government hit back at the allegations. “Stop intimidating us,” Congolese media reported the electoral commission head, Corneille Nangaa, as saying. “Stop trying to influence the CENI decision. The CENI will announce the results in accordance with the law and the results it collected in all polling stations.” Lambert Mende, the minister of communications, defended the internet shutdown and the revocation of the accreditation of the Radio France International correspondent. He said: “We’re not a sort of zoo in which thrill-seeking tourists from the whole world are invited by pyromaniacs to see savages fighting in a lawless land.” President Kabila’s mandate expired in 2016 but he delayed elections by more than two years, arguing that an important census had not yet been held to count the number of voters, and that the country could not find the £1.4bn it said it needed to hold an election. He has ruled the country since 2001, when his father was assassinated.Polling just before the election showed a large majority of Congolese supported the opposition candidate, Martin Fayulu, a former businessman.The same poll showed almost half of respondents said they would protest against a rigged election, and more than half said they would not accept the result if Shadary was declared the winner.The US threatened sanctions against officials attempting to undermine democracy.Robert Palladino, a state department spokesman, said: “Those responsible for undermining democratic institutions and processes, threatening the peace, security, or stability of DRC or benefiting from corruption ‎will be held accountable. “Those who undermine the democratic process, threaten the peace, security or stability of the DRC, or benefit from corruption may find themselves not welcome in the United States and cut off from the US financial system. There are moments in every nation’s history when iniduals and political leaders step forward and do the right thing. This is one of those moments for the DRC.”Jason Stearns, the director of the Congo Research Group at New York university, said the DRC was “in a different universe” after the church’s statement.“I think it is a very crucial moment,” he said. “I don’t think Kabila’s going to step down tomorrow ... but we had always suspected there were going to be flaws in the electoral process, there were certainly many suspicions that they could be rigged in favour of the ruling coalition but to have the Catholic church step up and say we know who won these elections, we have proof and we will publish – that is very different from just saying the process has been flawed.”He added: “They’re trying to make sure we don’t end up in a situation where CENI announces different results, there are then inevitable protests in the streets that turn violent, there’s a regime that digs in its heels and they end up in an ugly confrontation. To be honest, that’s where I think we’re going to end up.”Perhaps only way it wouldn’t, he said, was if the South African and Angolan presidents, the African Union chair and Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, all got together and told Kabila: “It’s over, it’s over, it’s over, step down or else.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e41a97ebb231709e429ffdd5f75e3a8afc744c3/0_14_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15da01bca4e39b9590bec43d003ed159","title":"mexico amlo president savings money","story":"Despite spending his adult life in a political system where public service is seen as a route to self-enrichment, Mexico’s president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has revealed that he has a little less than $23,00 in savings.In his first financial declaration since taking office on 1 December, the leftwing president also said that his wife makes slightly more than he does and owns the Mexico City apartment where the couple live.“I’ve never been interested in money,” López Obrador, 65, told reporters. “I fight for ideals, for principles.”The title to a 1.2-hectare ranch inherited from his parents in southern Chiapas state, meanwhile, is already in the names his four sons, he said.López Obrador, popularly know as Amlo, has promised to govern with frugality, and cut his own pay to about $65,000 a year – less than half of what his predecessor made. His wife, author and academic Beatriz Gutiérrez Müller, makes about $72,000.He has also pledged to sell off the presidential plane, traveling instead on commercial flights and a Volkswagen Jetta.At his morning press conference on Friday, Amlo said he didn’t have a credit card and hasn’t had a checking account for years. He pulled a US $2 bill out of his wallet – given to him as a good luck token by a Mexican living in the US – insisting it and a 200 peso note was all he had with him.His display of personal austerity contrasts dramatically with other Mexican politicians. The administration of his predecessor Enrique Peña Nieto was marked by a string of corruption scandals.Amlo’s allies in Congress followed up his pay cut by approving a bill forbidding public servants from earning more than the president. The supreme court, whose justices are paid £10,900 monthly plus generous benefits, later ruled against the pay cuts.Public servants have pushed back against the proposed pay cuts, which include benefits being slashed – such as private healthcare plans. The Banco de México announced Thursday it would challenge the law in court. More than 15,000 bureaucrats have obtained injunctions, protecting themselves from the pay cuts.“There’s a lot of waste in government,” said Valeria Moy, director of México ¿cómo vamos?, a thinktank. “I don’t see the waste in the wages of public servants.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d23991ea4d00d60d091d3bb21ec5b705825d6dd/0_89_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45ae19da1d4b3d7b32d7097f3e156683","title":"nicolas maduro venezuela rebuke foreign ministers lima group","story":"A dozen countries and Canada questioned the legitimacy of the Venezuelan president’s soon-to-be second termA dozen Latin American governments and Canada have delivered a blistering rebuke to Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro, questioning the legitimacy of his soon-to-begin second term and urging him to hand over power as the only path to restoring democracy in his crisis-wracked country.The sharp criticism came at a meeting on Friday of foreign ministers from countries including Argentina, Brazil and Colombia, all of which have been weighing how to confront the increasingly authoritarian Maduro while absorbing a growing exodus of Venezuelans fleeing economic chaos.In a statement, the Lima Group urged Maduro to refrain from taking the presidential oath next Thursday and instead cede power to the opposition-controlled congress until new, fairer elections can be held.“Only through the full restoration, as soon as possible, of democracy and a respect for human rights is it possible to resolve the country’s political, economic, social and humanitarian crisis,” the diplomats said.Even before announcing the resolution, the group’s meeting with the participation of US secretary of state Mike Pompeo drew a sharp response from Venezuelan foreign minister Jorge Arreaza. He accused the coalition of taking orders directly from Donald Trump.“What a display of humiliating subordination!” Arreaza said on Twitter.A once-wealthy oil nation, Venezuela is in the throes of crisis, marked by hyperinflation that makes it difficult for people to afford scarce food and medicine. An estimated 2.3 million Venezuelans have migrated from the country since 2015, according to the UN.The Lima Group was formed more than a year ago by mostly conservative-run regional governments seeking to defuse a crisis in Venezuela that is increasingly threatening regional stability.While the group previously denounced Maduro as a “dictator” and urged dialogue, its hard-edged resolution calling on Maduro to step down suggests its members are losing patience.But beyond the heated rhetoric, the anti-Maduro coalition showed signs of fraying along ideological lines.Regional powerbroker Mexico was one of the early and biggest promoters of the Lima Group. But it sent a lower-level representative to Friday’s meeting who refused to sign the resolution, reflecting the policy of non-intervention favored by that nation’s new leftist president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador.Maduro traveled to López Obrador’s inauguration, meeting privately with the Mexican leader.The US is not formally a member of the Lima Group but has been a vocal supporter and Pompeo participated in the meeting via video conference.Pompeo this month made a visit to Latin America during which he attended the inauguration of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro and then stopped in Colombia to meet with President Iván Duque. Both Bolsonaro and Duque have declared a united stance against Maduro’s government aligned with the US.Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America, questioned Pompeo’s participation in Friday’s meeting.He said the Lima Group was created to showcase concerns of Latin American nations about Venezuela’s crisis and Pompeo’s involvement furthers a perception that the US has been quietly directing its moves.“I’m worried that this paints the region into a corner, with no clear path forward,” Ramsey said of the resolution. “The truth is that Maduro isn’t just going to hand over the keys.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/301241d3db4b4150d839e1f24d5525146c97c810/0_82_4028_2417/master/4028.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b593948cd0167dff816287bbac47269","title":"uk nationals in italy assured of residency in event of no brexit deal","story":"British in Italy group say their worst fears are over after landing new year Brexit breakBritish nationals settled in Italy have landed a new year Brexit break after the Italian government announced they would remain legal residents of the country in the event of no deal.High level officials from the Ministero degli Affari Esteri told volunteers in the British in Italy campaign group that they “would continue to be legally resident with their existing rights to work” if Theresa May does not get her withdrawal agreement ratified and the UK crashes out of the EU on 29 March.“Our worst fears are over. This makes Italy the first EU27 country to publicly declare their plans for citizens’ rights post-Brexit, and to provide the reassurance we have been awaiting so long,” said the group in a statement.The Italian breakthrough comes days after immigration officials in Berlin vowed to open an urgent registration process to secure legal status will be in place for them in the event of the UK leaving the EU with no deal.The Berlin authorities delivered their promise quickly opening the registration process on Thursday 3 January, and telling worried Britons that if there was no deal they would be briefly exempt from German law requiring residency documentation.“From 30.03.2019 onwards British citizens in Germany will, for an initial period of three months until 30.06.2019, be exempted from the requirement to possess a German residency title,” they said on their website.Before Christmas the French also sought to reassure British nationals in France of their status post-Brexit. Nathalie Loiseau, the Europe minister, said that France would guarantee the residence, employment and welfare rights of the 160,000 resident British citizens living there provided that Britain offered the same guarantees to French expatriates.There are an estimated 60,000 British nationals living and working in Italy who were concerned at the prospect of becoming “irregular” with no rights to reside, work, or access national healthcare or social security if there was no deal.While British in Italy says they feel reassured that they will not now be illegal, they are concerned that they lose some of their rights including the freedom to move to another EU country or work or offer services in another EU country.This is because negotiations on these rights were set aside, to be discussed at the next Brexit phase of talks on the future relationship between the EU and the UK.“I feel a mixture of extreme relief that whatever happens with Brexit we will be able to continue to live legally in our adopted home, but this is coupled with a great anger that I and so many others have been left in this situation for so long when it could have been settled on 27 June 2016,” said Denise Abel, member of British in Italy.But she added: “I thank the Italian government from the bottom of my heart for doing what was promised to us, making it possible for us to continue to live our lives as before. The situation is not perfect for those of us who rely on freedom of movement for our work but at least we Brits in Italy can sleep better in our beds knowing we will not become illegal in our own homes.”A fellow member of the campaign group, Carole-Anne Richards, said she had “mixed feelings” about the news but her immediate feeling was “one of relief” that she won’t be illegal.“At the end of the day the UK government has not ensured my rights will be the same as promised – they will be significantly diminished,” she said.The absence of freedom of movement affects Britons who work in multiple EU countries and has lead to accusations that the EU and May are leaving them “landlocked”.According to one of the representative of British in Italy, the Italian state representatives assured them “they are working on legislation that will be in place by 29 March, so in the event of no deal we will all be legally resident and entitled work and continue with our existing rights now, as they are now”.They said they are hoping to replicate the rights Britons have had under Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement if that is ratified.This will mean British nationals can continue to live and work in the country, but they will still be without some of their rights including the freedom of movement to live or work in another EU country, or the ability to offer services in another country.British in Europe, the coalition of campaign groups for Britons facing the loss of rights because of Brexit, have accused the UK of abandoning an estimated 1 million Britons who would be left high and dry if the UK crashes out of the block.The UK did not respond to this offer and instead came up with its own version of immigration rules for EU citizens in the UK forcing the EU to negotiate on these terms."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Earlier complaints do not relate to senior officer suspended pending inquiry outcomeAuthorities trying to establish if she was killed before or during armed stand-offOnly in cases where charge being pursued would process continue after retirementBelfast rape trial review called for no change to NI law allowing naming of defendantsDublin Cycling Campaign says NTA proposals for four bus corridors have been \u0026lsquomixed\u0026rsquoIrish women \u0026lsquobecome invisible when history is appropriated in this way\u0026rsquo, says AndersonHolidays, homes, yachts and jets \u0026ndash or acts of decency and generosity?

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe It would be “helpful” if European Union leaders knew what clarifications they could offer on the Brexit withdrawal agreement that would assist UK prime minister Theresa May pass the deal through the House of Commons, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.Speaking after a phone call with German chancellor Angela Merkel, the Taoiseach said they both agreed to stand by the Brexit withdrawal agreement and discussed how to help Mrs May pass the deal in the House of Commons.Separately, almost 1,000 police officers from England and Scotland are to begin training for deployment in Northern Ireland in case of disorder from a no-deal Brexit, according to a report in .The plans were put in place after Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) chiefs asked for reinforcements to deal with any trouble that arises from a hard border. The training for officers from English forces and Police Scotland is expected to begin this month.The prospect of large numbers of English and Scottish officers being deployed on the streets of Northern Ireland after March 29th could complicate efforts to restore the power-sharing executive at Stormont, which collapsed in 2017.The option of reinforcements is deemed necessary to cover the possibility of civil disorder arising from disquiet about Border arrangements that could be put in place after a hard Brexit.The PSNI request was made under mutual aid arrangements, which are in place to enable local police forces to help each other in times of heightened demands.On Thursday, Mr Varadkar said while the EU could offer assurances and clarifications to the UK, nothing could “contradict or change” the withdrawal agreement struck in November, including the backstop.The backstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard border in Ireland even if there is no future EU-UK trade deal next March, is the main impediment to Mrs May getting the deal passed in Westminster. MPs are due to vote on the deal in the middle of the month.There have been calls from the United Kingdom for clarifications that the backstop will be temporary, and Mr Varadkar has said it was always only meant to hold “unless and until” a future trade deal that avoids a hard border is in place.“What would be helpful for us as EU prime ministers and presidents would be to know what clarifications would be enough to secure a majority in the House of Commons but always understanding that clarifications, understandings, guarantees, explanations cannot go against the spirit or render inoperable parts of the withdrawal agreement,” he said.“We need to know what the United Kingdom parliament wants in terms of those guarantees and those clarifications. This is something we will have to see develop over the next week or two.”Mr Varadkar said he and Ms Merkel spoke for about 40 minutes at the chancellor’s request. They also spoke about planning for a no-deal scenario, which was also discussed by the Cabinet in Dublin on Thursday.At the Cabinet meeting on January 15th, Minister for Health Simon Harris and Minister for Transport Shane Ross will give detailed outlines of planning for the supply of medicines and in the transport sector if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal in March. Other ministers will follow at subsequent meetings.The Taoiseach said that the 45 pieces of legislation needed for a no-deal Brexit outcome will be condensed into four large Bills. If needed, time would be cleared in the Dáil and Seanad in March for such legislation rather than have both Houses “tied up” in January and February, the Taoiseach said.On the issue of State aid in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Taoiseach said the Government would largely be asking the EU for “State aid clearance”.“Us being allowed to use our own money to support companies, businesses and farmers who are adversely affected by Brexit,” he said.Mr Varadkar will travel to Bavaria on Friday to address the annual gathering of the Christian Social Union, the regional sister party of Ms Merkel’s national Christian Democratic Union."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3747008.1546533512!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nostalgia for deutschmark fades as germans accept euro","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA customer pays for a hot dog in Frankfurt at the start of  2002.

Photograph:  EPAA series of votes may be needed in the House of Commons to see what type of post Brexit relationship between the EU and UK is acceptable to British MPs, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said. Mr Varadkar said it is still his hope that the Brexit withdrawal agreement is ratified by the House of Commons in a vote later this month, which he said would be the best outcome for Ireland.However, speaking to journalists at a conference of the Christian Social Union (CSU) he is attending in Bavaria, Germany, Mr Varadkar said that, if the withdrawal agreement is rejected, “we would have to look at what actually gets passed to see if there is a majority for anything”. He said a parliamentary motion passed in Westminster showing a majority in the House of Commons for a certain post-Brexit relationship would send a signal to the EU that the position in London was changing. “For example, the last time they had a series of votes they voted against forming a customs union which would have been a permanent customs union, not a temporary one, by about three votes. “Potentially, that vote may go the other way but, like I say, this is all speculation and while it is unclear where exactly the United Kingdom stands, it is absolutely, abundantly clear where Ireland and the European Union stands.”However, he stressed that any changes would only be to the political declaration, the looser accompanying document to the legally binding withdrawal agreement, which points towards the post-Brexit relationship between the EU and UK.The backstop – the insurance policy to avoid a hard border if future trade talk between the EU and UK fail – is contained in the withdrawal agreement.The backstop is the element causing the most difficulty for UK prime minister Theresa May, and is the most contentious issue for many of her Conservative MPs. “I don’t mean the backstop,” the Taoiseach added. “I mean the future relationship which is the political declaration. “It’s always been the position of the European Union and it’s there in the guidelines that if the United Kingdom were to change its red lines then we’d be happy to talk to them about that. Bear in mind they decided very early on they weren’t just leaving the European Union. “They were leaving the Customs Union and the single market and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Obviously if the UK were to turn around and say that they have changed their mind on those issues we wouldn’t say sorry it’s too late.“I think what we have always said is that if the United Kingdom were to evolve from its red lines the European Union could as well. If they decide they want to stay in the single market or they want to stay in the customs union, in those circumstances I think the European Union would evolve its position as well.” However, he said such a change of mind is unlikely.Earlier on Friday, Mr Varadkar told the conference that Brexit has been traumatic but not fatal for the EU.“People often say that a orce can be like a death in the family,” he said. “It can also bring those left behind closer together. The Brexit orce has at times been traumatic, but it has not proven fatal to the European family. Speaking on Friday evening the Taoiseach said support for EU membership and the single currency had increased not decreased across the continent.“In the midst of all the arguing in the search for an agreement, we have found strength and we have found solidarity from each other. We need to take this with us as we deal with other challenges.”Peace in Ireland was born out of “the European ideal, by communities coming together not growing apart”, he said. “In many ways, the EU is a Franco-German peace process. In Ireland, the EU was a fundamental pre-condition for our peace process sweeping away borders and differences without threatening anyone’s nationality or loyalties. “We cannot allow that to falter now. Despite the ever-shifting sands on the trek towards a settled Brexit destination, two things have stayed constant. The first is European support for Irish concerns and safeguarding peace on our island. The second is our understanding of what must be defended.”He said we are “determined to protect the Good Friday Agreement: peace in Britain and Ireland power sharing in Northern Ireland, and ever closer co-operation North and South”.“We are determined to prevent the re-emergence of a hard border on our island. “At the same time, we want the future relationship between the EU and the UK to be as close, comprehensive and ambitious as possible, provided there is a level playing field and the integrity of our single market is upheld.”The CSU is the regional sister party of the Christian Democratic Union, the national party. In his speech, Mr Varadkar also paid tribute to German chancellor Angela Merkel, the outgoing leader of the CDU.The Taoiseach is due to meet her successor as CDU leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, at the Bavarian event on Saturday.Aside from Brexit, the Taoiseach said: “To preserve our way of life and advance all our values we need more Europe not less. “Issues such as climate change, terrorism, cyber-security, illegal migration, international trade, and the regulation of major corporations are transnational. On these we need to think and act together.“We must stand together or we will fall one by one.”He also said that migration is one of the biggest challenges facing Europe.“We need to act, but we cannot risk losing the middle ground. We need to win the argument, or we lose everything. So I believe that we need a degree of burden sharing and the resettlement of migrants within the EU, and I support the new framework agreed late last year based on new principles.”He said a small number of countries “are shouldering the responsibility of providing refugees with a fresh start in Europe”. “All of us can and must do more. Ireland has accepted migrants from Greece and our navy is participating in Operation Sophia in the Mediterranean sea.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

guidance for parents.The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said there was no safe amount of total daily screen time, but urged parents to show “tough love” in setting age-appropriate limits.In particular, the advice says parents should take firm action if time on smartphones and videogames is “displacing” other activities - such as sleep, exercise and face-to-face socialising.And its experts urged parents to “practise what they preach” - and spend less time of their leisure time glued to tablets and phones.The guidance comes alongside a systematic review of the scientific evidence regarding the health impact of screen time, published on Friday in BMJ Open.It found moderately strong evidence for a link between greater screen time and depressive symptoms.Researchers said it appeared that the “displacement of positive activities” - in particular, lost sleep, as a result of time spent scrolling - was the most convincing explanation for the link.And they said the impact of blue light on screens on the ability to sleep was likely to be a factor.Dr Max Davie, from the RCPCH, said stopping access to all screens for at least an hour before sleep was a  “sensible rule of thumb”.“The process of going to sleep is a physiological process involving the secretion of melatonin and screens appear to interfere with that,” he said.Researchers said the review also found links between high levels of screen time and excess weight - perhaps because children were likely to consume more snacks while staring at a screen.The college also urged parents to negotiate “age appropriate” boundaries on screen time with children, with firm consequences if such limits were breached.Dr Davie said families needed to ensure that screen time was “under control” - for adults as well as children.“Children do learn from example rather than instruction. It\u0027s difficult to impose strict limits on your children\u0027s screen use if you are constantly on screens yourself. It\u0027s much better to be authoritative about screens if you practise what you preach,” he said.“We suggest that age appropriate boundaries are established, negotiated by parent and child that everyone in the family understands. When these boundaries are not respected, actions need to be put in place with parents making consequences clear.”Four ways to keep your child safe onlineProf Russell Viner, the college’s president, said: “If you are authoritative - tough love and giving clear boundaries and warmth, that works.”The chief medical officer is currently considering setting new recommendations on screen time for children. But the college shied away from recommending a daily screen time limit for all children, saying more research was needed, particularly on the use of social media.So far, many studies on screen time have focussed on television habits, failing to keep up pace with the advent of websites and smart phones.Next week the head of the NHS is expected to unveil plans to expand children\u0027s mental health services to deal with the fallout from an explosion of social media.Simon Stevens has said the NHS has been left “picking up the pieces” of an epidemic of mental illness fuelled by digital overload.It comes after The  launched a duty of care campaign calling for more stringent regulation of sites like Facebook and Instagram, in order to protect children from harm.The expansion of mental health services for children - and the rollout of a four week target for treatment - are expected to form part of a 10-year plan for the NHS.Paul Hollywood\u0026#39s ex-wife says she does not regret staying with him after his first affairSex abuse investigation launched after woman in vegetative state for decade gives birth in nursing homeEllen DeGeneres campaigns for Kevin Hart\u0026#39s reinstatement as Oscars hostLuther, series 5 episode 4 recap: more tangled than headphones left in the washEx sleaze watchdog calls for review of mechanisms to oust MPs following Fiona Onasanya scandalComment: Remainers are wrong to think the world hates Britain for seeking independenceVice chancellor in line for £830,000 pay package despite universities\u0026#39 pledge to show wage restraintPeople urged to blow whistle on England player \u0026#39caught snorting cocaine at Christmas party\u0026#39Ban knife offenders from social media, say MPs and victims\u0026#39 familiesStar of viral \u0026#39yellow vests\u0026#39 music video denies anti-SemitismChristmas Day orces filed by 13 couples online as ministers accused of making it too easy to end marriage Zimbabwean doctors stop emergency work in escalating pay strikeFugitive speedboat killer\u0026#39s legal aid for appeal examined by Ministry of JusticeMan stabbed to death in front of his son on board train near Horsley in SurreyComment: As time goes on, more people are waking up to the benefits of a \u0026#39mitigated no deal\u0026#39French deploy Navy boats, aircraft and drones to combat migrant crossings Donald Trump warns US government shutdown could last more than a yearLondon Marathon under pressure to award medals to guide runners after RNIB protestChild killer freed twice from prison must not be allowed to harm public again, Parole Board warnedArt detective who hunts down stolen paintings plans to wrest Renoir from Bristol galleryWomen urged to stop shaving for \u0026#39Januhairy\u0026#39 and take on Disney\u0026#39s \u0026#39smooth\u0026#39 stereotypesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/01/04/TELEMMGLPICT000184117259_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"chinas once shunned surfers riding wave state support beijing","story":"Surfing coaches have been hired to promote the sport among Chinese youth in preparation for future Olympic games, now that the sport will debut at Tokyo 2020Five years ago surf shop staffer Li Jing, 31, didn’t have to fight for the best wave-catching spots in Riyue Bay, on the southeast coast of south China’s Hainan Island.

His lawyers insisted that Ms Griffin did not have the legal right to sue.Yet on Wednesday Mr Stanton dismissed Sheeran’s arguments, and set the case on a path towards trial by jury.Marvin Gaye, who was shot and killed by his own father in 1984, was one of the most influential of Motown musiciansNot only are there substantial similarities between several of the two works\u0027 musical elements, but an ordinary observer might experience the aesthetic appeal of both works as the same, wrote Mr  Stanton in his ruling.Even without considering the bass-line and drum parts, which are not present in the LGO deposit copy, the question whether TOL infringes on LGO should be determined by trial rather than summarily.Mr Stanton also noted that a jury may be impressed by footage of a Sheeran performance which shows him seamlessly transitioning between LGO and TOL.The case came about after a culture website, Spin, noted similarities between the two songs in 2015.Ed Sheeran attempted to avoid a trial by asking the judge to rule on the matterMs Griffin, who works helping prostitutes in Houston, told the website that she was simply seeking to “do the right thing”.“I hate it that me and the family had to go to this measure to get their attention. I’m not looking for the public’s attention. It’s time for people to just do the right thing.”She said that she was contacted by a friend, who told her “this young British kid actually copied the music from dad’s song”.She added: “The law is the law. If I went and rented a car, they’re not gonna let me keep their car without paying them. And if I don’t pay them, then I’ve broken the law.”Sheeran’s record label, Atlantic Records, and his managers did not respond to The ’s request for comment.Ed Sheeran performs on stage at Wembley Stadium on July 10, 2015But the singer has been accused of copying music before.Sheeran settled a $20 million (£15.7m) copyright claim in August 2017 over his song Photograph, resolving the dispute out of court for an unspecified sum.In November he also settled a suit brought by two Australian songwriters over a song he co-wrote with Tim McGraw and Faith Hill called The Rest Of Our Life.The Australians were represented by Richard Busch, a lawyer who successfully sued Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke over their smash hit Blurred Lines, on behalf of the Marvin Gaye Estate.In March, Gaye’s estate – which is not involved in this case – was awarded $5.3 million in damages from Williams and Thicke.“I still wish Mr Sheeran all of the best,” Ms Griffin continued.“I really think he comes off as a really nice guy.“I think he’s a talented person, I do like the song. I’d like the song better if he does right by my father’s work. And I want my father’s name added as one of the writers. If you’re going to use the music, be fair! Be fair, that’s all.”Please review our commenting policyPaul Hollywood\u0026#39s ex-wife says she does not regret staying with him after his first affairSex abuse investigation launched after woman in vegetative state for decade gives birth in nursing homeEllen DeGeneres campaigns for Kevin Hart\u0026#39s reinstatement as Oscars hostLuther, series 5 episode 4 recap: more tangled than headphones left in the washEx sleaze watchdog calls for review of mechanisms to oust MPs following Fiona Onasanya scandalComment: Remainers are wrong to think the world hates Britain for seeking independenceVice chancellor in line for £830,000 pay package despite universities\u0026#39 pledge to show wage restraintPeople urged to blow whistle on England player \u0026#39caught snorting cocaine at Christmas party\u0026#39Ban knife offenders from social media, say MPs and victims\u0026#39 familiesStar of viral \u0026#39yellow vests\u0026#39 music video denies anti-SemitismChristmas Day orces filed by 13 couples online as ministers accused of making it too easy to end marriage Zimbabwean doctors stop emergency work in escalating pay strikeFugitive speedboat killer\u0026#39s legal aid for appeal examined by Ministry of JusticeMan stabbed to death in front of his son on board train near Horsley in SurreyComment: As time goes on, more people are waking up to the benefits of a \u0026#39mitigated no deal\u0026#39French deploy Navy boats, aircraft and drones to combat migrant crossings Donald Trump warns US government shutdown could last more than a yearLondon Marathon under pressure to award medals to guide runners after RNIB protestChild killer freed twice from prison must not be allowed to harm public again, Parole Board warnedArt detective who hunts down stolen paintings plans to wrest Renoir from Bristol galleryWomen urged to stop shaving for \u0026#39Januhairy\u0026#39 and take on Disney\u0026#39s \u0026#39smooth\u0026#39 stereotypesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"impeach motherfer newly elected democratic congresswoman vows","story":"A newly elected Democratic congresswoman has vowed to impeach Donald Trump, the US president, in an expletive-laced speech that has provoked outrage among Republicans.Rashida Tlaib, who was sworn in on Thursday, said we\u0027re gonna impeach the motherf----- during a celebration party with supporters.In a clip of the event circulated widely on social media on Friday, Ms Tlaib can be heard telling a crowd: People love you.

We have been diligently attending to emergencies hoping that the current impasse would be resolved,” a statement from United Bulawayo Hospitals read. Doctors across the country have been on strike to demand better pay and working conditions as Zimbabwe grapples with severe currency shortages and spiralling inflation.Members of the executive met with (first lady Auxilla Mnangagwa) but no agreement was reached, Mthabisi Bebhe, secretary general of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, told Reuters. The strike has not been called off.Mrs Mnangagwa is an advocate on health issues.The doctors\u0027 first strike in March last year marked the first major labour dispute faced by Emmerson Mnangagwa, the president, who is under pressure to repair an economy suffering after decades of missteps by his predecessor Robert Mugabe.Africa\u0026#039s tarnished jewel: how four decades of Robert Mugabe left Zimbabwe\u0026#039s economy reelingPublic hospitals have been left short of drugs and reliant on patients to buy them, while some pharmacies have stopped accepting insurance policies for purchases and are demanding payment in US dollars.Dwindling spaces in mortuaries combined with a lack of doctors to fill in the paperwork to see bodies taken out and into funeral parlours has created a huge backlog.Doctors say their salaries, paid in local electronic cash, do not cover their living costs and they will not return to work until they are paid in real US dollars. Most junior doctors earn less than £100 per month. “The money which gets into our banks is not even enough for some of us to get to work if we are on shift,” Mr Bhebe told The Daily . “We have been insulted by the government, and it is not fair. We paid for our own education and we cannot survive on what we are paid... I am sure the nurses are organising now. They will go on strike soon.Emmerson Mnangagwa sworn in as Zimbabwe\u0026#039s new presidentThe bankrupt government says it has no money to meet the doctors\u0027 demands, and that medics must return to work or be sacked.The government says it will replace junior doctors with foreigners and medical students. All negotiations have broken down at the main teaching hospital in Harare, the Parirenyatwa, the largest in Zimbabwe, which is the only teaching hospital with a maternity ward. Insiders told The  that the number of beds has been halved from 5000, and most of its operating theatres and equipment are not working properly. Thousands of people with HIV and Aids say they fear their imported anti-retroviral medication will be delayed.  “There is no blood here, the equipment is not ready, there is nothing going on here, we can’t treat people,” said a senior nursing sister on Friday at the Parirenyatwa Hospital in central Harare, once once of Africa’s finest hospitals. Virtually no senior civil servants, cabinet ministers or the top national leadership seek medical help from Zimbabwe’s public health service and they also shun the well equipped, modern private hospital in Harare.  They usually use private hospitals in neighbouring South Africa, while Mr Mugabe and his wife, Grace, have long chartered international aircraft to undergo medical treatment at an exclusive clinic in Singapore. Please review our commenting policyPaul Hollywood\u0026#39s ex-wife says she does not regret staying with him after his first affairSex abuse investigation launched after woman in vegetative state for decade gives birth in nursing homeEllen DeGeneres campaigns for Kevin Hart\u0026#39s reinstatement as Oscars hostLuther, series 5 episode 4 recap: more tangled than headphones left in the washEx sleaze watchdog calls for review of mechanisms to oust MPs following Fiona Onasanya scandalComment: Remainers are wrong to think the world hates Britain for seeking independenceVice chancellor in line for £830,000 pay package despite universities\u0026#39 pledge to show wage restraintPeople urged to blow whistle on England player \u0026#39caught snorting cocaine at Christmas party\u0026#39Ban knife offenders from social media, say MPs and victims\u0026#39 familiesStar of viral \u0026#39yellow vests\u0026#39 music video denies anti-SemitismChristmas Day orces filed by 13 couples online as ministers accused of making it too easy to end marriage Fugitive speedboat killer\u0026#39s legal aid for appeal examined by Ministry of JusticeMan stabbed to death in front of his son on board train near Horsley in SurreyComment: As time goes on, more people are waking up to the benefits of a \u0026#39mitigated no deal\u0026#39French deploy Navy boats, aircraft and drones to combat migrant crossings Donald Trump warns US government shutdown could last more than a yearLondon Marathon under pressure to award medals to guide runners after RNIB protestChild killer freed twice from prison must not be allowed to harm public again, Parole Board warnedArt detective who hunts down stolen paintings plans to wrest Renoir from Bristol galleryWomen urged to stop shaving for \u0026#39Januhairy\u0026#39 and take on Disney\u0026#39s \u0026#39smooth\u0026#39 stereotypesEd Sheeran faces trial in New York accused of copying Marvin Gaye\u0026#39s Let\u0026#39s Get It OnWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/04/15/bitcoin-price-latest-news-update.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6258776  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/04/15/bitcoin-price-latest-news-update.jpg","title":"bitcoin birthday cryptocurrency anniversary satoshi nakamoto future predictions","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearOne popular idea is that regardless of bitcoin\u0027s utility as a means of financial transaction, it can and will continue to act as a store of value, like a form of digital gold.\u0026nbspSo what do the next 10 years, or 20 birthdays, hold for bitcoin? One thing many cryptocurrency analysts\u0026nbspagree upon is that price volatility will steadily decrease, thanks to a combination of its finite supply and regulation designed to help the market\u0026nbspstabilise and mature.Bitcoin price predictions for 2019: From $0 to $36,000, experts weigh Whilst some critics still argue, for varying reasons, as to the longevity of\u0026nbspbitcoin, the next 10 years should at the very least provide many more talking points and events to document its life,\u0026nbspDavid Thomas, director of Mayfair-based cryptocurrency broker\u0026nbspGlobalBlock, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.If, as expected, increased regulation enters the market then bitcoin will be opened up to a broader investor base, and with increased adoption, we expect to see volatility reduce and stability increase both of which will establish bitcoin and cryptocurrencies further as an asset class in their own right.10th birthday has prompted speculation about the cryptocurrency\u0027s future (Rock Star Pastries Composite)Bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology is also expected to continue to drive an entire industry of new applications.\u0026nbspVladislav Dramaliev, head of digital marketing at aeternity, believes this is where bitcoin\u0027s real promise lies.Mr\u0026nbspDramaliev\u0026nbspdescribes bitcoin\u0027s inception as starting a curious revolution, but believes the word evolution will be more appropriate to describe the next decade of bitcoin and blockchain\u0027s growth.One of the most incredible developments is that, 10 years after that first block was mined, there is actually a whole\u0026nbspindustry\u0026nbspbased around this fantastic technology. Today we have a mind-bogglingly erse range of iniduals and companies in the sphere, covering every possible spectrum of opinion, vision for the future, and agenda, he said.The public blockchain infrastructure is getting better and better, more developers are getting interested in blockchain applications, more entrepreneurs are looking for the next killer app, and more users are playing with digital assets on a blockchain. I don’t expect this process to slow down. Everyone looks at Bitcoin and sees something different, depending on their own background.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/09/13/20/house-building-0.jpg","title":"brexit services purchasing managers index december","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

If a Brexit deal is agreed soon, growth will surely rise this year.The services PMI covers sectors such as hotels, restaurants, transport and finance, although not retail.Separately, the Bank of England reported on Friday that unsecured lending to British households slowed to an annual rate of 7.1 per cent in November, the slowest rate\u0026nbspsince March 2015.The number of new mortgage approvals for house purchases also fell to 63,728 in the month, well below the expectations of City of London analysts.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Spears said in an additional statement on her website:\u0026nbsp“I am dedicating my focus and energy to care for my family.

If a Brexit deal is agreed soon, growth will surely rise this year.The services PMI covers sectors such as hotels, restaurants, transport and finance, although not retail.Separately, the Bank of England reported on Friday that unsecured lending to British households slowed to an annual rate of 7.1 per cent in November, the slowest rate\u0026nbspsince March 2015.The number of new mortgage approvals for house purchases also fell to 63,728 in the month, well below the expectations of City of London analysts.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

When adjusted for inflation, credit card debt is fractionally below a peak reached in Early\u0026nbsp2010 as the country emerged from one of the deepest recessions in its history.People with low incomes or living in poverty were turning to credit cards because of their heavy marketing and easy availability, according to David Steele of The Money Charity.Credit card lending continues to rise as interest rate hike loomsWhen personal loans are added in, each UK household has almost £8,000 of outstanding consumer credit.The Money Advice Service (MAS) estimates that 8.3 million people in the UK are over-indebted, and that 22 per cent of UK adults have less than £100 in savings, making them highly vulnerable to a financial shock such as losing their job or incurring unexpected bills.The precarious position of so many household could pose a wider threat, according to the BoE which warned more than a year ago that banks were in danger of underestimating the risks they face from being too lax in lending to consumers.\u0026nbspIf the economy were to enter a new downturn, lenders could incur £30bn of losses on their lending on credit cards, personal loans and for car finance, the BoE said in July 2017.But consumer credit, which includes credit cards, store cards, car finance and other loans grew 7.1 per cent in the year to the end of November to £215.4bn.Despite ongoing fears about the future of the economy as the UK prepares to leave the EU Britons have increased their total amount of credit card debt in every month since July 2013 as wages have lagged behind the rising cost of living.Earnings growth picked up to the highest level for a decade in the final quarter of 2018 but this has done little to make up for 10\u0026nbspyears of wage stagnation that has left average inflation-adjusted earnings still languishing below their pre-crisis levels.Sue Anderson of StepChange, which provides free advice for those facing debt problems, said credit cards are the single most common issue the charity encounters.\u0026nbsp“More than two thirds of people we helped in the first six months of last year had credit card debt, with an average of around £7,600 on their outstanding borrowing on cards,” Ms Anderson said.\u0026nbspConsumer credit growth slows in DecemberConsumer credit growth hits new 11-year highMore than a third of single mothers in debt, research findsOil-hungry companies are contributing to huge debt problems in Africa“Credit cards can be useful and convenient, and when used as originally intended for short-term purposes, can be a helpful way of timing payments.\u0026nbsp“But if borrowing builds up without being paid back on a monthly basis, it can become expensive and increasingly difficult to pay off – which is why the regulator is now requiring firms to take steps to help their customers address persistent credit card debt. If you are struggling to manage, seek free advice from a reputable debt charity.”The figures highlight a ide in the UK between those able to borrow at close to record-low rates against the value of their homes and others pressured into taking out high-cost credit in order to make ends meet.While interest rates have remained close to historic lows as the economy continues to grow slowly, the average APR on credit card lending bearing interest was 18.5 per cent in October 2018, higher than the 15 per cent seen in 2006 before the financial crisis.What to do if you want to reduce your credit card debt“Don’t panic,” says David Steele of The Money Charity. “Don’t get pressured into doing something before you have had time to take advice. There are usually managed ways out.”Contact\u0026nbspStepChange\u0026nbspon 0800 138 1111.

Transferring a debt from a card with a high rate of interest to one with low or 0 per cent interest could help you pay off the debt faster.Make an assessment of all of your borrowing across cards, loans, overdrafts etc. Make sure you are paying off those with the highest interest rates and charges firstWhen charges are taken into account, overdrafts can sometimes be more expensiveHowever, remember that credit cards should not take priority over debts such as Council Tax, rent or utilities, where the consequences of not paying may be worseA January 2018 report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found that one in four of the UK’s poorest households are in arrears with debts or are spending a quarter of their income or more on debt repayments.Borrowers could face a further squeeze with the BoE\u0026nbspexpected to raise its benchmark interest rate further this year, a move that will probably be passed on to consumers.However, millions of consumers do not pay any interest on their credit card debt, either because they clear their balance each month or because they have secured a 0 per cent deal. Just under 45 per cent of credit card balances pay no interest, according to UK Finance, an industry trade body.Those paying high interest rates may be able to transfer their balance to a cheaper card or consolidate their debts into one loan with a lower rate.The average APR for a £5,000 personal loan in October 2018 was 7.7 per cent while for a £10,000 loan it was 3.8 per cent.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

When adjusted for inflation, credit card debt is fractionally below a peak reached in Early\u0026nbsp2010 as the country emerged from one of the deepest recessions in its history.People with low incomes or living in poverty were turning to credit cards because of their heavy marketing and easy availability, according to David Steele of The Money Charity.Credit card lending continues to rise as interest rate hike loomsWhen personal loans are added in, each UK household has almost £8,000 of outstanding consumer credit.The Money Advice Service (MAS) estimates that 8.3 million people in the UK are over-indebted, and that 22 per cent of UK adults have less than £100 in savings, making them highly vulnerable to a financial shock such as losing their job or incurring unexpected bills.The precarious position of so many household could pose a wider threat, according to the BoE which warned more than a year ago that banks were in danger of underestimating the risks they face from being too lax in lending to consumers.\u0026nbspIf the economy were to enter a new downturn, lenders could incur £30bn of losses on their lending on credit cards, personal loans and for car finance, the BoE said in July 2017.But consumer credit, which includes credit cards, store cards, car finance and other loans grew 7.1 per cent in the year to the end of November to £215.4bn.Despite ongoing fears about the future of the economy as the UK prepares to leave the EU Britons have increased their total amount of credit card debt in every month since July 2013 as wages have lagged behind the rising cost of living.Earnings growth picked up to the highest level for a decade in the final quarter of 2018 but this has done little to make up for 10\u0026nbspyears of wage stagnation that has left average inflation-adjusted earnings still languishing below their pre-crisis levels.Sue Anderson of StepChange, which provides free advice for those facing debt problems, said credit cards are the single most common issue the charity encounters.\u0026nbsp“More than two thirds of people we helped in the first six months of last year had credit card debt, with an average of around £7,600 on their outstanding borrowing on cards,” Ms Anderson said.\u0026nbspConsumer credit growth slows in DecemberConsumer credit growth hits new 11-year highMore than a third of single mothers in debt, research findsOil-hungry companies are contributing to huge debt problems in Africa“Credit cards can be useful and convenient, and when used as originally intended for short-term purposes, can be a helpful way of timing payments.\u0026nbsp“But if borrowing builds up without being paid back on a monthly basis, it can become expensive and increasingly difficult to pay off – which is why the regulator is now requiring firms to take steps to help their customers address persistent credit card debt. If you are struggling to manage, seek free advice from a reputable debt charity.”The figures highlight a ide in the UK between those able to borrow at close to record-low rates against the value of their homes and others pressured into taking out high-cost credit in order to make ends meet.While interest rates have remained close to historic lows as the economy continues to grow slowly, the average APR on credit card lending bearing interest was 18.5 per cent in October 2018, higher than the 15 per cent seen in 2006 before the financial crisis.What to do if you want to reduce your credit card debt“Don’t panic,” says David Steele of The Money Charity. “Don’t get pressured into doing something before you have had time to take advice. There are usually managed ways out.”Contact\u0026nbspStepChange\u0026nbspon 0800 138 1111.

Transferring a debt from a card with a high rate of interest to one with low or 0 per cent interest could help you pay off the debt faster.Make an assessment of all of your borrowing across cards, loans, overdrafts etc. Make sure you are paying off those with the highest interest rates and charges firstWhen charges are taken into account, overdrafts can sometimes be more expensiveHowever, remember that credit cards should not take priority over debts such as Council Tax, rent or utilities, where the consequences of not paying may be worseA January 2018 report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found that one in four of the UK’s poorest households are in arrears with debts or are spending a quarter of their income or more on debt repayments.Borrowers could face a further squeeze with the BoE\u0026nbspexpected to raise its benchmark interest rate further this year, a move that will probably be passed on to consumers.However, millions of consumers do not pay any interest on their credit card debt, either because they clear their balance each month or because they have secured a 0 per cent deal. Just under 45 per cent of credit card balances pay no interest, according to UK Finance, an industry trade body.Those paying high interest rates may be able to transfer their balance to a cheaper card or consolidate their debts into one loan with a lower rate.The average APR for a £5,000 personal loan in October 2018 was 7.7 per cent while for a £10,000 loan it was 3.8 per cent.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The announcement led the company\u0027s share price to plunge dramatically, and led to concerns about the future success of the phone.But Mr Cook\u0027s letter to staff suggests that there are a range of successes for Apple away from its Chinese and iPhone troubles, pointing to a range of different business that continue to grow.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAnd he said that he is confident the company\u0027s current run of iPhones\u0026nbsp– the XS, XS Max and XR – are without a doubt, the best iPhones we’ve ever made.

Ben Chu investigatesClick to followThe IndependentShadow chancellor John McDonnell (right) has suggested Labour could include a pledge to reduce the working week in its next manifestoAs a society we can’t seem to make up our minds about work. Do we want more of it? Or less?There’s a chilling fog of fear over what technological advances will mean for our jobs, with an endless supply of alarming forecasts about how robots and algorithms are set to displace human workers.But there’s also a furnace of angst about low productivity and under-investment by firms in just the kind of innovations that induce those nightmares of a “jobs apocalypse”.Boss wants to make four-day working week trial permanentSome lament the supposed proliferation of pointless, soul-dismantling, “bullshit jobs”. Yet no one gets out the bunting when a struggling company announces redundancies.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe UK’s official labour market surveys suggest\u0026nbspmany of us want fewer hours at work, presumably driven by a desire for a healthier “work-life balance”.Yet those same surveys also show that many people also want more hours, that the post-financial crisis curse of “underemployment” has not yet been lifted.Some complain about the raising of the state retirement age and the depressing prospect of being forced to work longer than they planned. But for others the big problem is ageism, the risk of being pressured out of jobs they enjoy prematurely.When it comes to work, we’re rather like those two diners in the Catskill mountains: “Boy, the food at this place is really terrible... Yeah, I know and such small portions.”Yet onto this terrain of confusion and apparent contradiction some stride confidently.To Alex Williams, a Corbynite academic, automation should be embraced by the left as the emancipation of labour, provided the gains are comprehensively redistributed.The Trades Union Congress seems to have been influenced by this cocktail of technological optimism and socialist assertion. Its general secretary\u0026nbspFrances O’Grady\u0026nbsprecently demanded a four-day week by the end of the century, declaring: “Bosses and shareholders must not be allowed to hoover up all the gains from new tech for themselves.”The Labour Party is keen too. The shadow chancellor John McDonnell has made favourable noises about the four-day week and is reported to be asking the crossbench peer, Robert Skidelsky, to head an inquiry into the subject.Yet this isn’t just a British story. There are tectonic rumblings from abroad too. The IG Metall union in Germany earlier this year won the right to a four-day week for its almost 900,000 members. One technology start-up, founded by former Google employees, has a “Free Friday” policy. Even a think tank close to the authorities in China has called for the most populous nation on the planet to have a four-day working week as soon as 2030.Any project that can unite German metal bashers, Silicon Valley coders and Chinese Communist apparatchiks clearly has an unusually wide appeal.So is the four-day week a big idea whose time has come? Or is it an unworkable left-wing fantasy? And even if a four-day week is economically feasible, should we really desire it? Or is it a case of being careful what you wish for?When Marei Wollersberger and her colleagues established an east London-based data design agency, Normally, as a four-day week operation in 2014, the motivation was largely personal.“We wanted to lead happier lives basically – enjoy ourselves more, not just to defer our enjoyment to retirement age,” she told me.But there was another goal: “There was also a motivation to be more productive.”The economics of the four-day week revolve around the concept of productivity, the amount we produce per hour worked.The size of the economy – the size of our national income – is derived from the value of all the goods and services produced by businesses and households.On the face of it, if we all worked one less day a week, our personal output would drop by around fifth. Multiply that fall across the overall economy and you’ve got an economy that is considerably smaller, implying lower income and lower living standards for all, one way or another.Yet what if working fewer hours were to stimulate our productivity? What if we produced more per hour working four days than we did per hour working five?In that case there might be no overall drop in total output, and therefore no decrease in living standards. If our productivity rose enough we might even have a higher income than we did before.Wollersberger says the model has worked in stimulating performance at her company. “You’re more productive – you achieve exactly the same or more in four days as you would in five,” she says. “And I honestly believe it’s better work.”\u0026nbspA New Zealand financial firm called Perpetual  found similarly gratifying results when it trialled a four-day week recently.“There was broadly no change in company outputs pre and during the trial,” said its boss. “No reduction in job performance and the survey data showed a marginal increase across most teams.”Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The results of a Swedish trial involving 70 nurses working a six-hour day were more mixed. While there was some boost to worker productivity, the city of Gothenburg also had to hire more nurses to cover the hours lost.Intuitively, this seems much more likely to be the result of moving to a four-day week in services sectors that are, currently at least, heavily reliant on face-to-face human interactions such as healthcare or teaching.That’s not to imply the shift in working patterns should be ruled out as impractical. There are benefits in terms of lower stress and happiness to set against those financial costs. But it’s probably unrealistic to expect the move to always pay for itself, at least in the short-term.And some experiments have flopped. Treehouse, an online educational firm in Oregon, was one of those companies which got media publicity for its four-day week in 2015. But Treehouse’s founder recently lamented that the working practice killed the work ethic in his company and called the experiment a “terrible thing”.The only way is down?Inidual “micro” trials are certainly useful, but they aren’t necessarily a reliable guide to “macro” economic impacts.The closest thing that we have to a state-mandated four-day week is France’s 35-hour week, introduced in 2000 under the Jacques Chirac-Lionel Jospin cohabitation.Jospin\u0026nbsp(left) and president Jaques Chirac (right) (AFPGetty)The first thing to bear in mind is that this does not mean all French people work a four-day week. The regulation simply means overtime kicks in after a worker has completed 35 hours and they accrue the right to holiday lieu days. Yet it does establish a social norm of fewer hours and a financial incentive for firms to limit them.Opinions are mixed about its results. France has a high unemployment rate relative to the UK and other developed countries and it’s notable that Emmanuel Macron campaigned for president promising to increase the flexibility of the system.And though the level of French productivity stands comparison with the most productive nations in the world, there’s no evidence that its growth rate has risen since it introduced the 35-hour week.This might incline us to scepticism about the value of the the state having any role in limiting working hours.\u0026nbspYet that could be the wrong conclusion. For the historic trend is clear. In the late 1900s, UK workers put in more than 2,500 hours a year on average. That’s down to 1,680 hours in 2017. There’s been a similar steep fall in other developed countries over the past century and a half.That reflects the fact that the five-day working week, as opposed to six days with only Sunday off, only become standard practice in the 20th century.It was the industrialist Henry Ford who was the pioneer in the US, giving his factory workers a five-day shift in 1926 while keeping their wages steady. This prefigured legislation and Congress’ 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, which mandated a maximum 40-hour working week (effectively five working days).We primarily think of John Maynard Keynes as the great promoter of employment for his pioneering theories on the economic benefits of government-funded job creation during the Great Depression.\u0026nbspBut it was this secular decline in hours worked, despite the agonising surge in unemployment in the 1930s, that led Keynes to look forward to a 15-hour working week in The Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren by the year 2000.The question is whether the recent flattening out is the end of the decline in hours worked,\u0026nbspor merely a pause.\u0026nbspAnd is a government nudge necessary to get history moving again?There’s also the question of consumption. One of the reasons Henry Ford instituted a five-day working week was revealed in a 1926 interview: “Leisure is an indispensable ingredient in a growing consumer market because working people need to have enough free time to find uses for consumer products, including automobiles.”In other words, it was less a paternalistic concern for his workers’ well-being\u0026nbspthan a recognition that it would create help create more customers for Ford.There’s an echo of this macroeconomic concern today, with government-linked Beijing researchers suggesting a four-day week could boost the domestic tourism and entertainment sectors and help rebalance the overall Chinese economy to consumption and away from excessive investment.But perhaps the major economic question about moving towards a four-day week is whether it\u0026nbspcould somehow boost our long-term productivity growth rate (perhaps by inducing more investment in automation by firms) or whether a shorter working week could only ever be the fruits of productivity growth with an origin elsewhere.The truth is that we don’t know the answer. Yet it’s vital to recognise that countries and societies have autonomy too, even now.\u0026nbspThe US has a considerably larger GDP per capita than any developed country in Europe. But the bulk of this gap is due not to a vastly higher level of productivity but the fact that Americans, on average, work many more hours than the French, Germans or Swiss or British and so on.The trade-off between work and leisure is different between our two continents. Both Europeans and Americans, by global and historical comparisons, have very comfortable standards of living. Choosing more leisure over extra working hours is not, whatever some might employers might argue, necessarily a route to penury and decline.Doing nothing for ever and everThe Victorian historian and essayist Thomas Carlyle believed in the redemptive power of work.“A man perfects himself by working,” he enthused. “Foul jungles are cleared away, fair seed-fields rise instead, and stately cities ... Even in the meanest sorts of labour, the whole soul of a man is composed into a kind of real harmony the instant he sets himself to work.”The (possibly apocryphal) epitaph on a Hertfordshire gravestone took a different view of the intrinsic value of hard labour.“Here lies a poor woman who always was tired​”One does not need to be a Carlyle-style work zealot to appreciate that there is some intrinsic psychological value to labour. Work is where many of us find not just an income, but friends, stimulation and status. But we can also see where that Hertfordshire washerwoman was coming from.This dichotomy underlines that not all jobs are the same, or are experienced the same by the worker. For every occupation that that does help to clear away someone’s jungles of mental disorder there will be one that is felt as detestable drudgery.One of the deficiencies of the debate over the four-day week, as with discussions of the appropriate retirement age, is a failure to acknowledge the vast ersity of both jobs and workers. Labour is not homogeneous.Working until 70 might seem entirely reasonable, even desirable, to the university professor, the politician or the TV presenter. But to the cleaner, the firefighter or shop assistant – especially jobs with a physically arduous component – it may have considerably less appeal.\u0026nbspAnd so views erge too on the desirability of the four-day week.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Frances Connolly, 52,  and Patrick Connolly, 54, from Moira, County Armagh in Northern Ireland, who scooped a £115 million EuroMillions jackpot in the New Year\u0027s Day lottery draw, during a photocall at the Culloden Estate and Spa in Holywood, Belfast, as they announce their winThe offshore patrol vessel HMS Mersey leaves Portsmouth Harbour as it is deployed to patrol the English channel following an increase in migrants crossing in small boatsRail protestors wearing masks with the faces of Prime Minister Theresa May and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling outside Kings Cross St Pancras station in London ahead of a visit by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to highlight \u0027rising rail fares and falling standards of service on Britain\u0027s railways\u0027 as part of Labour\u0027s Rail Action DayPolice restraining a man after he stabbed three people at Victoria Station in Manchester last night.

He confirmed he will remain in post and thinks it is important to continue working with Cabinet colleagues to ensure the best Brexit outcome for the countryOne of the most significant developments in the UK and broader Western economy over the past decade is the rise of the gig economy and self-employment. Around a sixth of the British workforce is now self-employed.This was brought home to me recently when I met the Romanian father of one of the friends of my young son. The father had been a chauffeur for a wealthy family in Chelsea. But he’d resigned after his son had started school and had signed on with Uber so he could pick his lad up directly from school and shift his driving work to airport shuttle-runs at night instead. “I wanted the flexibility and my previous employer couldn’t provide that,” he told me, as we watched our boys career around the playground.His work-life balance was not to be found in limiting the hours he worked (indeed he wanted to keep those the same or even increase them) but in the flexibility of his arrangements.Survey evidence suggests this is a common story. The majority of Uber drivers like the personal control over their working hours made possible by the platform. Drivers who valued flexible working reported higher levels of life satisfaction, as well as lower levels of anxiety.However, there was also a minority of Uber drivers who would prefer to work fixed hours in a more conventional work setting. And these workers reported lower levels of life satisfaction and higher levels of anxiety.A question of representationThis brings us back to the apparent paradox of many people in the UK workforce wanting fewer hours but many others wanting more.\u0026nbspDavid Bell, a labour market economist from the University of Stirling\u0026nbspwhose work, along with Danny Blanchflower of Dartmouth College in the US, has highlighted this ergence, says that the groups who want fewer hours tend to be older, while those who are underemployed seem to be younger.One of the implications is that younger people in the workforce may need the money from more hours because they are under greater financial pressure, perhaps because they have families, or perhaps because they have suffered a greater real wage squeeze since the financial crisis.\u0026nbspThis suggests that Corbynite left is correct in stressing that to consider the economic and social case for a four-day in isolation is a mistake. Incomes plainly matter too, as well as the level of inequality.\u0026nbspOne has to consider the role of income redistribution and employment policies. Give people higher incomes and more “outside options” for employment, perhaps through a jobs guarantee or even a universal basic income, and the desire for extra hours in their current job may well melt away. They may begin to make different work-leisure trade-offs than they do now.Perhaps one of the reasons why we some people languish in ultra-flexible gig economy jobs they don’t appreciate – like those disgruntled Uber drivers – is that, despite what most economic analysts say, there is actually hidden slack in our economy – and that if the slack was eradicated they could find the kind of regular job they wanted elsewhere.But that still leaves a circle to be squared, presuming that different people, all else equal, are still likely to put different weights on work and leisure. How do we give those who would prefer a four-day week more freedom to choose it, while protecting the interests of those who don’t?The empowerment of ordinary workers is Professor Bell’s answer. Let inidual employees have substantive input into determining the trade-off, rather than leaving it up to politicians or employers.This is how I know the NHS won’t survive without EU staffOver a million young women say they’re paid less than male colleaguesDJ jailed for raping boy, 3, in toilet at working men’s clubTrailblazing images of early 20th-century working conditions“One of the things that might help is a strengthening of worker representation, which has declined so dramatically,” he says. “Rather than jumping in to impose a four-day week you want to think first about whether workers’ interests are being properly represented.”This would be going with the historical grain, given the driving role of new trade unions in the achievement of an eight-hour working day in the 19th century and early 20th century.It’s notable not only that IG Metall workers in Germany this year were able to achieve a four-day working week through negotiation with bosses – but that they also had sufficient bargaining power to protect their overall levels of weekly pay.A fundamental question that underpins this broad discussion about the future of working hours is a philosophical one: what makes us happy and fulfilled as human beings?Modern psychological studies do partially back up Carlyle’s Victorian pompous sermonising: formal work can be as positive for human happiness as leisure, sometimes more so.\u0026nbspA job does seem to bring a valuable sense of social usefulness. Involuntary unemployment is clearly harmful for people’s mental health.But how much work do we want or need? Keynes in the 1930s called this desire for work “old Adam” and predicted that three hours a day in the future would be “quite enough to satisfy” this inherited instinct.Perhaps the right thing to do is not to dictate to people, or engage in speculation on what the future of work will look like, but rather to help them decide for themselves.Four day working weekOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But sceptics say “trail-hunting” is a cover.The South Shropshire Hunt had been licensed for trail-hunting events on trust land on one day next week and on 29 January.Pressure group National Dis-Trust says the South Shropshire took terriermen onto trust land at the Long Mynd estate last month and hunted for four hours, including hunting outside their licensed area.If I decided to run an event that met outside a village pub I would need permission from the councilThe National Trust allows “trail-hunting” but has banned the use of terriermen – men who use terriers to dig out foxes that have fled underground.“Multiple foxes were pursued and the terrierman waited to dig out. The police were informed of illegal hunting and use of quadbikes,” the activists claimed.\u0026nbspA fox was filmed narrowly escaping capture, they said, and video showed terriermen also apparently accompanying the hunt on quadbikes.Ten days later the trust website was updated to say all remaining dates for the South Shropshire had been cancelled for the 2018-19 season.National Dis-Trust said the South Shropshire Hunt was\u0026nbsp“still out for blood” elsewhere this week.The hunt said the allegations were untrue. Camilla Corrie, of the South Shropshire Hunt, told The Independent: “I understand there have been a number of unsubstantiated allegations made against us, but we continue to work closely with the National Trust and look forward to trail hunting in the near future.”\u0026nbspNational Dis-Trust also reported Shropshire’s United Pack to the trust for allegedly hunting on Long Mynd outside their licensed area and with quad bikes and terrier boxes.“They travelled directly across where the South Shropshire Foxhounds had marked a fox to ground the day before,” the group claimed.But a spokesperson from the United pack said: “The United operates within the law to comply with the Hunting Act 2004.The hunt works closely with all of their landowners, including the National Trust, to ensure they respect the wishes of the people whose land they cross, and are in discussions with the National Trust regarding the allegation that the hunt strayed out of their licensed area on the date in question.”Separately, just before Christmas the trust cancelled all dates for the Trinity Foot and South Herts Beagles but the reasons were unclear. The trust said it was because the date clashed with a deer cull at the Ashridge Estate but the hunt insisted it had always used the estate during annual culls.\u0026nbspA National Trust spokesman told The Independent: “This year we have concluded that, upon reflection, the area is not a suitable location to licence trail-hunting given the extensive deer management programme which takes place simultaneously.”Conducting the two activities at the same time at Ashridge was not compatible, he said. “Due to the ongoing issues surrounding the deer-management scheme, we will not be inviting future applications for trail-hunting on the estate.”The footage of a fox allegedly killed in Dorset emerged as thousands of Facebook users condemned footage of a rider from the Portman Hunt apparently kicking a horse in the stomach as he tried to mount it.\u0026nbspThe hunt said in a statement: “The Portman Hunt takes great pride in maintaining the highest standards of animal welfare. We are taking this very seriously and will deal with the matter internally.”Meanwhile, a businesswoman is trying to force local authorities to enforce rules that could prove an obstacle to hunt organisers.Barbara Wray says: “If I decided to run an event – say a community treasure hunt which was open to all members of the community, with children and adults on bicycles or segways, in wheechairs or on ponies … and I set the meeting point as outside the village pub ... I would have needed to have applied to the council for permission.”Ms Wray, who has qualifications in agriculture, says she has asked 12 councils so far whether hunts have applied for event permits but not one had said it had received an application. Some said it wasn’t their jurisdiction, others have not replied yet.She is starting a petition on Change.org, calling for hunts to be forced to apply for and be granted event permissions according to local council regulations and Health and Safety Executive guidelines and that they must supply risk assessments and proof of public liability before being allowed to meet on public land or highways.She said: “In addition the trail course must be submitted in advance, to the council for their approval – showing that horses and hounds will be kept well away from public highways.“Finally that trail hunts only permit horses, riders and hounds. No quad bikes or terriers should accompany the riders.”Last month Tetbury town council in Gloucestershire voted to ban the Beaufort Hunt, a favourite of Prince Charles, from its land.The Portman Hunt said it would fully co-operate with the police investigation into the apparent fox killing. A spokesperson said: “The hunt operates within the law to comply with the Hunting Act 2004.“Despite this, the hunt, along with many others across the country, is regularly subjected to spurious allegations of illegal hunting as part of a wider animal-rights agenda.”There were numerous clashes around the UK between hunters and protesters on Boxing Day and New Year’s Day as thousands turned out for hunt meets.The National Trust declined to comment on the cancelling of the South Shropshire licences.A spokesman said the United Pack was still licensed to trail-hunt on trust land “and we assume they will be using their one remaining licence date”.A spokesman for the Local Government Association said: “We are not aware that councils have a role overseeing hunts and clearly neither are the hunts, given none of them have submitted applications. If someone thinks that a contrary position is true, they should set out why and give some specific legal references.”The association has guidelines on how to stage public events, including obtaining council permission.The Countryside Alliance declined to comment on the idea of hunts obtaining permits from councils.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

He confirmed he will remain in post and thinks it is important to continue working with Cabinet colleagues to ensure the best Brexit outcome for the country“If some of those MPs can be persuaded to back the prime minister’s deal, it won’t be because they’ve come under pressure to do so from their local party members over the Christmas break,” said Prof Bale.\u0026nbspThe study found that 59 per cent of Tory members opposed Ms May’s deal, compared to 38 per cent who supported it and 3 per cent who did not have an opinion.More than half, 53 per cent, also said that the deal “does not respect the result of the referendum”, comparing to 42 per cent who said that it does.People were then asked how they would vote in a referendum where there were three options – to remain, leave with the deal or leave without one – and in which they are able to put down a first and second preference.Some 57 per cent opted to leave with no deal as their first choice, with only 23 per cent putting Ms May’s deal and 15 per cent backing the option to remain in the EU.Forty per cent\u0026nbspthen put the prime minister’s proposals as their second choice, with 19 per cent putting no deal and 6\u0026nbspper cent opting to stay as a member of the bloc.The survey showed large majorities of members think both that a no-deal Brexit will have a positive impact on the economy in the medium to long term and that warnings of disruption have been exaggerated.A slim majority, 51 per cent, said they thought Ms May was doing “well”, but almost as many, 48 per cent said she was doing “badly” to some degree.But despite wavering support for Ms May and her deal, an overwhelming majority of members – 83 per cent – opposed the idea of having an election, while 82 per cent would not back a further referendum.Yesterday, the prime minister’s Northern Irish partners in government raised the stakes further in the Brexit talks, saying there is “no need” for key parts of the deal she agreed with the EU.Nigel Dodds, DUP deputy leader,\u0026nbspargued that the withdrawal agreement she is seeking “flies in the face” of the government’s own commitments relating to the border between the north and the republic.His comments came after a meeting in Downing Street, and are a blow to the prime minister as she desperately tries to convince the Northern Irish party and her own MPs to back her proposals ahead of a vote in the coming weeks.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We’ve just accomplished the most distant flyby.”Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said: “In addition to being the first to explore Pluto, today New Horizons flew by the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft and became the first to directly explore an object that holds remnants from the birth of our solar system.“This is what leadership in space exploration is all about.”The radio message from the robotic craft was picked up in Madrid by one of Nasa’s big antennas. The data took six hours and eight minutes to traverse the massive breadth of space between Ultima and Earth.According to Nasa, scientists had not discovered Ultima Thule when the probe was launched in 2006, meaning the mission was unique. In 2014, astronomers found Thule using the Hubble Space Telescope and selected it for New Horizon’s extended mission in 2015. “Anything’s possible out there in this very unknown region,” said John Spencer, deputy project scientist for New Horizons. Launched in January 2006, New Horizons embarked on a 4 billion mile journey towards the solar system’s frigid edge to study the dwarf planet Pluto and its five moons. The spacecraft, which is the size of a baby grand piano, flew past Pluto in 2015, providing the first close-up views of the planet. During the flyby, the probe found Pluto to be slightly larger than previously thought. In March, it revealed that methane-rich dunes were on the icy dwarf planet’s surface.After trekking 1 billion miles beyond Pluto into the Kuiper belt, New Horizons will now seek clues about the formation of the solar system and its planets.There is a great deal scientists can learn from Ultima and the hundreds of thousands of similar bodies scientists deem to be in the solar system. Hal Weaver, project scientist on the mission, told the BBC the rock is “probably the most primitive object ever encountered by a spacecraft, the best possible relic of the early solar system”. The object is officially known as 2014 MU69, but was nicknamed Ultima Thule, a Latin phrase which means “beyond the borders of the known world”.Additional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It is vital Theresa May fights EU chiefs to ensure we have the right to trade freely across the globe without the “backstop” threat.Her Government must continue planning for a No Deal Brexit, so thatwe are forced into a clean break, Britain will continue to be Great.We want more energy and bold thinking from the Government. The country is crying out for some real leadership.The housing market remains broken, our NHS is strained, and the high street is in dire straits.Meanwhile, the migrant crisis has shown how quickly a problem can escalateit is not tackled head-on.Mrs May bought herself temporary respite by winning her no-confidence vote.

The EU will be guided through its many problems by a basket-case country with a pygmy economy, most of whose citizens are desperate to get the hell out and reach the UK.Every time you might doubt we did the right thing in voting to leave, the EU comes up with another brilliant reason not to stay in.Romania, with its beleaguered government and wealth per person lower than Trinidad  Tobago and Kazakhstan. That’s who will be running the show.Right now, though, we have to get our act together. In the middle of this month there will be a debate in Parliament about Theresa May’s “new” deal for us to leave the EU.Government ministers have been whispering that May has won some concessions from the EU negotiating team. I hope so. But I kind of have my doubts.As Lord Sugar might put it, she couldn’t sell prosecco to a hen party. But it’s time to get behind her. Time, too, for arch-Brexiteers to cease being so self-indulgent and vote through a deal that is the least-worst option.Sure, I’m no fan of Theresa’s Pedigree Chum plan ­— a dog’s dinnerever there was one. Truth be told, I’d rather we crashed out with no deal at all.But that would be more dangerous — for the British economy and even for Brexit.And waiting in the wingsthe Prime Minister fails to get her plan through is Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party.Frankly, I would rather stay in the EU than have Jezza as Prime Minister. As Tom Harris, a Labour Brexiteer, put it, May’s deal gives us Leavers slightly more than half of what we voted for. And given the result of the referendum two years ago, that seems about right to me. None of us get exactly what we want.But we do leave the EU and we retain control of our borders. And soon we’ll be free to strike our own, independent, trade deals. Reach out to the rest of the world. That seems to me a decent compromise.The problem lies in convincing the arch-Brexiteer Conservative MPs that now is the time to give up the fight. I understand their many reservations. But the reality is the deal May puts before the House of Commons is about the only solution that stands a chance of winning a majority.And we are in this position largely because the Tory Brexiteers never managed to sort themselves out. At every stage, they were ided among themselves and too often concerned about their political careers.Sothis isn’t the deal we all wanted, they have themselves to blame.Our negotiations with the EU should have been done with confidence and self-discipline.Instead, we were always on the back foot because of Conservative in-fighting.Now it’s time to get serious, at long last. Becausewe don’t push this deal through, we may not get Brexit at all.MY wish for the New Year is that someone might tell me what Kendall Jenner, Rita Ora and Ferne McCann actually do for a living. Other than this kinda thing.That’s wish No. Wish No is that Gary Lineker takes a self-awareness course and discovers he’s a bumptious t***er who knows next to nowt.Most of my social-media friends went to bed at pm to avoid seeing London Mayor Sadiq Khan’s ludicrous fireworks display.And all the downstairs lights were off in the houses in my street.Are people getting bored with New Year’s Eve, do you reckon Our Foreign Secretary has just landed in Singapore to drum up more trade for Britain post Brexit.This tiny country – just a city state – is a major economic force and an important ally.It’s also a good lesson for those whining lefties who blame colonialism for the desperate plight of Africa.Singapore was founded as a British trading post exactly  years ago. It was under British control until .It has a booming economy, one of the world’s highest le expectancies and a top standard of living.So it’s not done too badly, has it The truth is colonialism is NOTHING to do with the failure of African countries. It’s about good government.Theres going to be a gay bar in EastEnders.This is an innovation dreamed up by the new script editor, Kate Oates.It’s intended to make the programme more closely represent the area in which it’s set.Ha! Here’s a tip, Ms Oates. If you want EastEnders to truly reflect the borough in which it’s set – Tower Hamlets – you need a few more sweeping changes.Fewer than a third of Tower Hamlets’ residents are white British, so that’s most of the cast gone.Almost  per cent of the people there are Bangladeshi, so the programme should be broadcast in Bengali, not English.Come on, Kate. You want EastEnders to be more real Then make it REALLY real.Lets be honest. It’s not just whichever oaf parked Paul Pogba’s car in that disabled bay who is doing it.When I go to my local supermarket, all the disabled bays are full, every time.No stickers in the car windows.And the people inside the store don’t seem to be limping very much. Sometimes I fantasise about waiting by their cars, with a hammer, for them to emerge with their shopping.“Disabled, huh  Well, you are now.”But one of the problems, I think, is that we have too many disabled bays.And so people don’t take them seriously.Quite clearly, the French are doing nothing whatsoever to deter them.It wouldn’t surprise methey were actually herding them on to the dinghies.“Go on, monsieur, you can see the clfs over there. It’s not far. Bon voyage, mon ami.”It’s another two fingers from the hopeless French because we’re leaving the European Union.What we should be doing is towing the migrants all the way back to Calais.I know living in France is probably a “cruel and unusual punishment” under United Nations laws. But it’s time the French took their responsibilities a bit more seriously.Another year dawns with something  to be terried about.Evil Chinese mussels have invaded British waters, apparently. They smother our decent, God-fearing British scallops and oysters.By the time you read this, they will probably have made their way up the Thames.It’s time we took a stand against these vile, bivalved b******s.Leave our oysters alone, you Commies!

But the analysis warns that Britain’s second place is under “serious threat” from China due to its economic growth and naval investment.The rankings find Britain has retained its unique capacity to “project and extend itself around the world” and the audit also says Britain’s fundamental capacities have faced no “discernible impact” from Brexit.The audit’s chief analyst James Rogers said:“The pervasive spread of neo-declinism in Britain is wholly without foundation.Brexit has had no discernible impact on the UK’s fundamental ability to apply itself around the World.Although the UK is likely to retain its leadership role in Europe, it is also increasingly wedded to the so-called ‘Anglosphere’ - further investment in groupings like the Five-Eyes could help cement its successes.China’s rapidly expanding geopolitical capacity poses a serious challenge to the West. Over the past year, China has added tens of thousands of tonnes to its Navy andcurrent trends continue – it will overtake Britain as a global power by as soon as next year.If the rules-based order is breaking down, the UK should urgently invest in its armed forces’ projection capacities forward basing – not least in the Indo-Pacic region –it seeks to halt this sht.Urgent remedial action is also required – in  – to secure Britain’s continued economic, industrial and technological leadership.Without signicant new funding for Research and Development, the UK risks falling dangerously behind in the new technological race.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And there has been talk of a rt between Harry and his brother William and their wives.Meghan has also been accused of bombarding staff with am emails and displaying a demanding attitude toward staff — earning her the nickname “Duchess Dficult”.But former Hollywood lighting director Thomas, ,  said: “If there is any animosity between Meghan and Kate they should put their dferences aside. I’m very upset by the criticism Meghan is getting.“I don’t think she deserves it and I don’t think she is doing one third of the things she is being accused of doing.“I’m not buying that she made Kate cry. First off, I think Kate is a stronger woman than that.“I think Kate also knows she is in a stronger power position than Meghan is.“Kate’s the hero mother. I can’t see her being that weak.“No woman is who pops out a kid then walks out of hospital the same day.“I don’t think she’s afraid of anyone. And I don’t believe that Meghan is trying to hurt her in any shape or form. But at the moment I cannot call Meghan and say ‘What is going on  How can I help you ’“I need to know what the hell is happening and why it is happening. I need to know why she is being bashed every day.”Thomas, speaking exclusively to The Sun from his home in Rosarito, Mexico, said the wall of silence from Meghan was piling misery on him and the rest of his family.He  said: “This whole thing should have been one of the proudest moments of my le.“Now it’s like a dream that has turned into a nightmare. The royals and Meghan can help end this nightmare by simply giving me a call. To this day, I cannot think of anything I’ve done to deserve how I’m being treated now.“I’ve been a good father I’ve done nothing wrong. Axe murderers kill  people and their daughters still come and visit them in prison.“It’s just incomprehensible for Meghan to treat me this way.”Thomas had hoped to join Meghan’s mum Doria Ragland at the  wedding in Windsor last year but suffered a heart attack shortly before. And while recovering in hospital, he hung up on Harry, , during a heated row.The Prince had urged Thomas not to speak to the press — but he was caught co-operating with a paparazzi photographer.Harry told him: “This is what happens when you don’t listen to what we tell you to do.”But Thomas said: “I’ll keep talking and I’ll probably get louder. Meghan and Harry’s silence empowers all the crazy tweets and insults against me and my family.”Thomas admits he has made mistakes in the past, but said he is keen to make amends. He also hopes for an eventual first meeting with Harry. But today his message to him is: “Man up and get over it.“If I’m the first person who’s insulted you or hurt your feelings, you’ve got a long way to go.“He’s human just like the rest of us. I feel that he feels he is above everyone  and that he has a right to talk down to people.“And I cannot accept that. It feels like arrogance.”But despite the criticism of Meghan, , Thomas thinks she has settled into royal le.And he urged her new family to let her be herself. He said: “I now see her doing things she is comfortable with. I see her reaching out to people and hugging kids — because that is who she is.“If she’s able to continue doing that, it’s going to be fine — it takes away a little of the stuffiness.”He also said he is proud of seeing pregnant Meghan cradling her bump — and said he would love to play a part in the child’s le.But while Thomas remains proud of Meghan, he said he did not even get a Christmas card from her.He added: “On Christmas Day I visited some friends and received a lot of phone calls from every relative I have — except my daughter. I was prepared for it.”And he said he will carry on defending himself evenMeghan does get in contact with him. Thomas, also father to Tom Jr, , and daughter Samantha, , said: “I’ve been quiet long enough.“If they ever want to speak to me, maybe I’ll quieten down a little bit. But in the meantime I’m not going to become a monk in a monastery and take a vow of silence.“The bottom line is that I’ve done nothing to deserve this kind of treatment. I cannot cut my tongue out and never speak again. I can’t shut up because they have opened the door for a million people to criticise me and my family.”He said he feels the need to defend himself against online trolls attacking and misquoting him.He said: “One journalist claimed he had done a nine-hour interview with me. He came to pick me up for dinner with a female companion and was very unprofessional. I made him promise nothing could be used in a story.“The next day a story appeared. I do not want Harry and Meghan to believe I did the interview. They are the ones that told me not to believe everything you read.“In truth, there are a few journalists I have grown to trust and I use them to speak out from time to time.“I only speak because of the deadly silence from Meghan and the royals. No one was standing up for my family — so I had to.”Thomas ended his interview  by saying he plans to write a book “about the good years with my daughter and my fond memories of her growing up”.But the thing he wants most is reconciliation. He said: “I miss Meghan a lot. She was a big part of my le up until she met Harry.“But I don’t want pity. I remember my beautul daughter from the time she was born.“If she called me right now I would simply say ‘How have you been  I am glad to hear from you’.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Really I only ask because when the fly-by happened on New Year’s Day, the space craft was traveling at ,mph.This is known in technical circles as “very fast”.And think about it. If you try to take pictures of the underside of a motorway bridge as you pass by, you’re not going to learn much.And you’re only doing .So what nuggets of information came back from the edge of our solar system Ah well. Because the probe only has a -watt transmitter and because it’s four billion miles from earth and because the sun’s currently in the wrong place, we won’t have all the graphs and the algebra for  months.By which time, the boffins will have been given another gazillion dollars to go and look at another bit of frozen rock.I’m not one of those people who say the money should be spent on blankets for refugees.But can we stop pretending that space is a big encyclopaedia of facts we need to know Because it isn’t. The moon taught us nothing of any great consequence.Missions to Mars have given us nothing but a very good film starring Matt Damon and all we know about the bit between is that it’s cold and empty.Yes, further out, beyond the Thermal Shock Region, ten or five thousand galaxies from here, there could be all sorts of juicy titbits for the boffins to analyse.But we can’t get there.And we never will.Becauseyou were on a space ship that took off like the Enterprise, you’d fall over.So let’s concentrate our efforts on something which IS achievable.Turning space travel into the ultimate zero-g theme park ride for tourists.A CHINESE space craft landed on the Moon this week.I anticipate it will learn nothing of any great value but that, within a week, it will have built a factory that makes , pairs of training shoes every month.LIKE many other bores and cowards, I decided on New Year’s Eve to quit drinking for a little while.As I write, it’s lunch time on January  and already, a small rash has developed on my stomach.I looked it up on the internet and, of course, it’s cancer.I was going to have a drink to help me think about that but then I noticed that the pain in my hip is also cancer and so is my failing eyesight and so is my deafness and so is my wonky ankle and so is every symptom anyone has ever developed anywhere.As a research tool, the internet is brilliant. As a doctor, however, it’s scary . . . and almost always wrong.THERE are many noble and well-meaning attempts to make people stop filling the sea with bits of discarded plastic.Iceland, the supermarket chain, has started a “reverse vending machine” scheme which gives you a ten pence voucher for every empty plastic bottle you deposit.And there are many volunteers who comb the world’s coastlines, pulling plastic bags from the mouths of turtles and stranded dolphins.I wish all these people well.But I think a more targeted approach is necessary.Every time I go for a walk on Britain’s coastline, I notice that the high-tide mark is always littered with the plastic wrappers from milk chocolate Bounty bars and Flora margarine tubs.So how’s this for a plan You go to the people who make these things and you give them an ultimatum.Do something about it. Or we will do something to you, involving sharks.AS I watched the fireworks light up the night sky over London on New Year’s Eve, I wondered how long it would take someone to say the money should have been spent on the NHS.The answer, very depressingly, was about four seconds.Well, let me provide a retort.The amount of public money spent on the fireworks was £.million.Which isn’t even enough to buy one decent MRI scanner.Let me put it this way.You could save all your money for a rainy day and live on gruel.But it’s nice once in a while to spend a bit of it on beer and curry.MANY don’t enjoy the first few weeks of the year because it’s usually cold and dark and miserable.I love it though because all my friends are back from their Christmas holidays.Which means my Instagram feed is no longer full of their legs on a beach with nothing in the background but the blue sea and the bloody blue sky.I’M delighted to hear that Olivia Newton John isn’t as poorly as was reported earlier.I’ve always been a fan.Once, in fact, I wrote to Jim’ll Fix It askinghe could fix it for me to sleep with her.The filthy little pervert never even replied.THERE are so many exciting new things set to lt our spirits in .We have what will probably be the last Avengers movie and, a quarter of a century after the original, a new Toy Story.On the small screen, Game Of Thrones will be back and there will be world cups in rugby and cricket.The soundtrack will be provided by the Spice Girls reunion and . . .  none of you will be paying attention to any of it because this month, Theresa May’s useless Brexit deal will be dashed on the foreshore of democratic debate.This will cause Corbyn to propose a vote of no confidence which will trigger a general election.And the winner of that will stage a second referendum which will provide the same result as the first so there will be riots, petrol bombs, power cuts, death and the end of days.Despite this, though, I’d like to wish you all a happy New Year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is extraordinarily irresponsible and self-contradictory.He added the backstop was a “con trick” to keep the UK tied to Brussels rules.“On the one hand the Government is preparing to leave on WTO terms, while pretending that its preparations will be unsuccessful and disastrous.”Leading Tory Eurosceptic Tory Steve Baker gave his wholehearted support to the report and said leaving on WTO terms would end the “corrosive uncertainty” about Britain’s future.Theresa May pulled the vote on her deal before Christmas amid claims more than  Tory MPs were ready to vote against it – largely over concerns the UK will be tied to EU customs rules for years to come.Hardline Brexit-backing Tories agreed to an uneasy truce after the PM survived a no confidence challenge in her leadership last month.But, an-ex Cabinet Minister said they believed MORE Tory MPs were prepared to vote down the PM’s deal and accept a clean break with the EU – given the step up in preparations on both sides of the Channel.They added: “I don’t know anyone on our side whose views have changed over the Christmas break. If anything people are now more resolved to vote against.”A No. spokesman said: “As a responsible Government, we are preparing for all eventualities. But we think the best thing for this country is to leave with a good deal.”Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lamont added: “The government’s strongest card in negotiating a good free trade deal with the EU is its willingness to leave on WTO terms.“It is extraordinary that they should be talking down that possibility which as this paper shows has been absurdly demonised.“The Government seem desperate to scare people into accepting the unsatisfactory EU terms and to swallow the Withdrawal Agreement.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Mr Dudley insists it was not registered offshore for tax reasons, but for protection from animal rights activists. He told the Mirror: “I was approached by a consortium of farmers to operate a livestock service to Dieppe. This was at a time when animal rights activists were sending letterbombs to firms operating live animal exports.”   He added: “It had to be in the British Virgin Islands because we were all being hounded by animal rights activists. It was absolutely not for tax reasons, it was because we needed the anonymity.” Andy McDonald MP, Labour’s Shadow Transport Secretary, said: “Awarding a public contract to a firm run by someone who has historic links with tax havens is typical from the Tories. “With every passing day the depth and scale of the Transport Secretary’s irresponsibility becomes ever more evident. “It’s clear that Chris Grayling failed to undertake the necessary checks and due diligence on Seaborne Freight and its directors. His ministerial incompetence is a disgrace to the country.” Mr Dudley confirmed the business was registered with a so-called “brass plate” firm - an empty office which multiple firms used as their legal address. He said he withdrew from the firm when the mad cow disease crisis took hold, and livestock exports collapsed. He understands the firm still exists, but is not active.   The Department for Transport says both department officials and “highly reputable independent third party organisations with signicant experience and expertise” performed due diligence on Seaborne Freight before awarding the contract. But asked by the Mirror who the third party organisations were, they refused to say. Meanwhile, it has been claimed Seaborne Chief Executive Officer Ben Sharp once ran a shipping company that ceased trading with more than a million pounds of debts and a huge unpaid tax bill.

David Blicharz, , spilled lager over fellow passengers and reduced children to tears after he went berserk at , feet. His outburst happened when staff aboard a two and a half hour Jet flight from Turkey to Manchester refused to serve him any more alcohol. During the journey from Antalya, Blicharz, who worked for a business travel consultancy, told air hostess Kayla Stanbury she was a mother f***er and f***ing stupid as she and other cabin crew urged him to behave. He also began arguing with his girlfriend before being made to sit at the back of the aircraft until it landed at Manchester Airport.Other passengers were so fed up of his swearing they offered to help restrain him, a court heard. Blicharz, who was arrested on touchdown, later claimed he got drunk after a problematic and costly trip away with his partner and two children which became embroiled in a series of arguments and worsened as they were about to go home. But in a statement one of the crew members said it was the worst abuse they had ever encountered on a flight.  At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Blicharz of the citys Whalley Range district admitted being drunk on an aircraft and was today jailed for four months. He has lost his job since the incident on November  last year and his relationship has broken down, a court heard. Prosecuting, Zoe Dawson said: The defendant had embarked on a Jet aircraft flying from Antalya to Manchester but was found to be displaying drunk and disorderly behaviour. He was moved several times during the flight and he continued to upset other passengers with his abusive language and behaviour. This lasted for around two and a half hours. At one point it was stated by the crew members that he spilt alcohol on another passenger and was moved as a result. Cabin staff stated children were upset and crying, listening to the behaviour. He was purchasing drink on board until one member of staff decided to halt any further purchases. She states she was asked by the defendanthe could purchase further alcohol, he was told she would not serve him and he would have to wait. She said she would go and deal with other members on the aircraft instead of him at that juncture. Because of this he ignored the cabin crew assistant called Kayla Stanbury and approached another member of the cabin crew. He ignored what she said and moved to the back, and approached another staff member to purchase alcohol. She, thereafter, went to confront the defendant, she spoke to him about the fact he had ignored her and purchased alcohol. At this point the defendant referred to her as a trolley dolly with stupid red lips. She then asked for his passport and he called her a mother f***er.  Miss Dawson said the defendant shouted and swore at the stewardess and other members of staff. She told a court there was more than one announcement by the Captain expressing an iniduals behaviour was unacceptable. Miss Dawson added: Considerable time and thought was given as to whether it was appropriate to redirect the aircraft. That decision was not made. Eventually staff members were able to take the defendant to the rear of the aircraft and he sat with members of staff for the duration of the flight. During the incident other passengers offered to assist the crew because of the extreme behaviour of the defendant, that they felt necessary to ask whether they needed help restraining the defendant. On landing the police arrived at the aircraft, but earlier the captain radioed ahead regarding his behaviour. In mitigation, defence lawyer Simon Blakebrough said: The aircraft was not put in any immediate risk, though it could have been. The background to what went on is that his relationship was not going very well. He went on holiday with his partner and her two teenage children. It cost a lot of money, and there were many problems on the holiday. There were arguments during the holidays, particularly when they were planning to go home to the UK. He had a little bit to drink before getting on the plane. He did drink more alcohol on it. He had a row with his partner in the seats they were allocated, so he asked to move to the front of the plane and the crew accommodated.  The defence lawyer continued: He was served alcohol in that seat and he drunk it. He asked for some further alcohol to be served to him. He then went to the back, but said the crew wouldnt serve him. Things escalated quickly as they tried to take the alcohol off him. He accepts his behaviour fell far below what it should be. His behaviour was in front of cabin crew, children and other passengers, and he accepts it would have caused them signicant distress. He has indicated remorse. He is appalled by his behaviour and would like to apologise to all concerned. He is sorry for any inconvenience and distress he has caused. He has since abstained from alcohol completely. He was working for some years in a business travel agency. He is fluent in German and Polish. He has lost his current job because of these offences, he has lost his good character and his relationship is over. He has expressed remorse at what has happened and wishes to put this behind him. Sentencing the judge Mr Recorder Andrew Nuttall told Blicharz: The aircraft was filled with passengers many of whom had been on holiday and your behaviour was one of drunkenness and abuse, in particular towards the senior stewardess who you were particularly abusive to. You called her a mother f***er, a trolley dolly with stupid red lips, f***ing stupid and other such appalling language. You had been moved from your seat on more than one occasion. It was noted children were present on board the flight, who were clearly concerned with your behaviour and it is highly likely they would have been frightened. Its well known that travelling on an aircraft lies a special duty with passengers to behave. They are confined in a small area for a y period of time. He added: The safety of passengers may well be put in jeopardy over a relatively small incident which could have catastrophic consequences. People are entitled to have an uneventful flight which they have usually paid a great deal of money for. In cases like this, courts make clear a punishment of immediate imprisonment should reflect a deal of deterency. You have said you hold remorse for your behaviour and you have presented that you have gained counselling. You have a good record and are fluent in two languages. You are described as extremely competent and have excellent scholastic accomplishments. However, this offence is too serious for anything other than a custodial sentence. Upon leaving the dock, Blicharz said to the Judge: Thank you.

Builder Carl Roberts, , spent pound, on the mini-boozer complete with pub sign, bar stools, pool table and Sky Sports shown on TV. He claimed he built the ft by ft wooden structure as a shed and garden room to entertain family and friends. But planners have ordered him to tear it down after housing association inspectors discovered he was illegally selling alcohol on the premises. Carl, who built the secret pub in his garden in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, two years ago now has  days to demolish it or face legal further action. But the dad-of-two denies he has broken any laws and claims he uses the pub, which he called ‘The Dick Inn’, for family parties.   He said: The only things the pub has been used for are kids parties and the occasional barbecue. Ive never had any complaints and no one has ever had a problem with it before. “The beer taps are all fake. We’ve got a fridge where we keep cans of beer but I’ve never charged anyone for anything. “Bromford [Housing Association] came round after our neighbour had a fire in their shed and now Im being told I need to take it down. Im a builder by trade so I know how to build a decent shed. “Its not something Ive just knocked up - its cost me about pound, to build. A lot of money has gone into it. Worcestershire Regulatory Services even warned Carl faced up to six months in prison for selling alcohol without a licence. A letter sent by Bromford said: Following our recent visit to your property to inspect the large building in the rear garden, it appears you have built a micro bar and it is apparent that this is not being used for personal use.   A following letter from Worcestershire Regulatory Services goes on to say that information has been provided to us that licensable activities, including the sale by retail of alcohol, are being carried on at the property, and warns that enforcement action will be takenlicensable activities continue. Jo Fieldhouse, head of locality for Bromford, said: “All customers are required to obtain written permission when planning alterations to their home and this is something which every person living in our homes agrees to as part of their tenancy agreement with us. “Unfortunately the process wasn’t followed on this occasion and, when a surveyor assessed the structure at  Teme Avenue, we found it not only conflicted with our own guidelines on what is acceptable but it was also above the size allowable without planning permission from the local authority. Where we find there to be issues with the structure, or its construction or use, our standard procedure is to give customers  days to remove it as we have done in this case.” "},{"url":null,"title":"family reunited after four years","story":"NewsFamily reunited after four years without a single day in the same room togetherPolice officer David Bald finally got to spend the holiday break with his family of ten after years working the Christmas period miles away from homeShareCommentsByGrant Bailey:,  JAN NewsDavid Balds family were reunited - after almost four years apart \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis is the moment a family were reunited - after almost four years apart.

Callum Berry only stopped his horrying attack when he saw flashing blue lights from a police car outside, a court heard. By the time cops arrived he had already kicked her in the head, punched her all over and broken a bone in her face when he started to throttle her. The terried woman said she didnt stand a chance as he carried out the attack which left her an absolute mess. Now the -year-old has been jailed for  months at Newcastle Crown Court, reports Chronicle Live.The woman said in her victim impact statement: I cant believe he has done this.   He is a big, ft in bloke who boxes and does MMA fighting, I didnt stand a chance. He was kicking me in the head while I was on the floor. When he was choking me I honestly thought he was going to kill me, I couldnt breathe. This was a prolonged attack, my face is an absolute mess. Prosecutor Michael Bunch told the court the couple had been out for the evening together last September but Berry was resentful that they were back at her home by pm.   Mr Bunch said he was already highly intoxicated and had started goading his victim for an argument, then broke a bathroom window while trying to climb out. The court heard the woman had shown Berry a cut she received cleaning up the broken glass. Mr Bunch added: She said that then led to the defendant, effectively, going ballistic. He punched her to the face, hard enough to cause her to fall to the floor. Then he started to kick her while she was on the floor. She was crying and trying to get up.

Mr Bunch said: At that point, realising what she had done, he pulled the living room door from its frame and started to stamp on it. He said he had nothing to lose, came back towards her and placed his hands around her throat. He started to squeeze so she struggled to breathe. She said by this stage she was terried, gasping for breath, trying to beg him to stop but struggling to speak because of the tightness of his grip around her throat. At that point, the police arrived at the scene, blue lights illuminated the room and meant the defendant let go. She fell to the floor. The court heard the victim was taken to hospital, where it was found she had suffered a fracture to a bone in the left side of her face. She has been left with ongoing issues, including nerve damage, which she had been told may take up to  months to completely repair. Berry, of Boston Crescent, Sunderland, admitted causing grievous bodily harm and causing criminal damage in the house during the attack. Recorder Tom Little QC told him: You put your hands around her throat and she struggled to breathe. She said in her victim personal statement she thought she was going to die as a result of what must have been a truly horric incident for her. Fortunately, the police arrived, you saw the blue lights and let go of her throat.

The sperm of  men whose shypartners had experienced three or more consecutive miscarriages was compared to that of men whose partners had not had one. Their samples had higher levels of DNA damage, the study found. Recurrent miscarriage affects around one in  couples and is defined as the consecutive loss of three of more pregnancies before  weeks. Until recently it was thought to be caused by health issues with the mother such as infection or immune problems.  Dr Channa Jayasena, lead author of the Imperial College London study, said: “A growing body of evidence suggests sperm health dictates pregnancy health.” DNA damage may be caused by too high levels of reactive oxygen species, molecules that are meant to protect sperm from infection.

The government is advising families with dferent surnames to take supporting documentation to airports with them in order to prove they are related. Earlier this year the Home Office shared an image on Twitter urging parents to take birth or adoption certicates on holiday with them in order to speed up the passport control process. They added: Families with dferent surnames may be asked questions to establish their relationship. The tweet was met with a great deal of indignation from parents on the social  and Labour MP Stella Creasy compared the UK to Gilead - a fictional patriarchal dystopia in novel The Handmaids Tale. One Twitter user responded: I am fundamentally against this. My husband and I have dferent surnames. And our son bears my husbands. Not unusual for parents to have dferent surnames in the st Century. Appalling stuff by @sajidjavid and the Home Office. Another wrote: Just to clary women who chose not to take their husbands surname or have children with a partner they are not married to will be subject to increased border measures. This is what freedom looks like under a Tory government  Straight out of Gilead.  Why might families with dferent surnames be questioned at airports  After sharing the original message the Home Office added a follow-up tweet to explain why the procedure is so important, writing: We have a duty to safeguard children and to prevent people trafficking, child sexual exploitation and other crimes. That is why Border Force officers sometimes need to ask additional questions. On the governments website the situation is explained further: Every day thousands of children arrive at the UK border, manyfrom holiday with their family or with family friends. The safety and welfare of every child is of utmost importance to us and sometimes we may ask a few questionsan adult is not the child’s parent, or has a dferent family name. For more information on Border Forces policy, there is a leaflet parents can access on the governments website.  Advice for families travelling with dferent surnames The government advises that,you are travelling with children who have a dferent surname, you may be asked questions at the border to prove your relationship. You can help by bringing with you the following documents:a birth or adoption certicate showing your relationship with the child orce or marriage certicatesyou’re the parent but have a dferent surname from the child a letter from the child’s parent or social worker giving permission for the child to travel with youLast year, a lawyer warned mums and dads they could unknowingly end up embroiled in a child abduction case, be refused past check-in, or turned away at border controlthey fail to take the right documents with them, the Manchester Evening News reported. One of those was Wigan mum Hannah Marshall, who was stopped with her daughter Lilly at London Stansted Airport when they ed from a holiday in Denmark. At the time Hannah, , wasnt married to Lillys dad Scott, so while Lilly had the surname Marshall, Hannahs was still Thomas.  Hannah said While queuing I went to one desk with my daughter and my partner and his mum went to another desk for passport control. They looked at both mine and my daughters passports then asked me how I knew the little girl and when I said it was my daughter they asked why I did not have the same last name. They asked my daughter who I was to her and thats when my partner came over and explained that shes his daughter too and as we werent married she had his last name.  They told us that my partner should have taken her through passport control because I would need to prove she was my daughter. They checked my partners passport to prove she held the same last name and then let us through. It can, however, be dficult for a person to prove they are a childs parent on the spot, unless they are carrying the right documents. David Connor heads up the family department at Woodcocks Haworth and Nuttall Solicitors, who have offices in Bury and Lancashire and says parents need to plan ahead to avoid being caught out. He said: People need to take extra caution when holidaying with children who don’t share their surname as they could unknowingly end up embroiled in a child abduction case, be refused past check-in, or turned away at border control. It’s vital you have the correct documentation to hand or it could derail your trip. For separated families, you’ll need evidence of approval from your child’s other parent, but remember to seek approval from everyone with parental responsibility – this may include grandparents too. He added: You’ll also need a copy of any Child Arrangement Order which proves you have court approval to take the child abroad. It’s vital that all evidence marries up and this is where orced parents are often caught out, particularly women who revert back to their maiden name. A change of name deed will help here, which can be supplied by a solicitor. Take a copy of your child’s birth certicate with you too to prove who you are. You wont need permission from an absent parenttheyre not on the childs birth certicate, butan absent parent has passed away you may be required to take the death certicate with you. If an absent parent doesnt consent to you taking the child out of the country you will need to go to court to try and resolve the matter.

Harry has secretly agreed to join more than , elite commandos shypractising a counter-attack against a Russian invasion of Norway, which lies on Europe’s northern flank against Russia and is vulnerable to invasion.  Sources say the -year-old former Army Captain, who is also head of the Royal Marines, will spend time visiting the marines while the multi-million pound war games are taking place over  weeks, signed off by Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. A senior military source said: “Prince Harry will be totally immersed in the exercise, and he will be privy to top-secret battle plans. “It will be high-tempo, extremely rshyealistic and his involvement is good news for the Marines, who will see his involvement as a very positive message of shyencouragement to the Corps. “They are the main force who will protect Europe’s northern flank in the event of a conflict, the tip of the spear, and it is important Harry is among the troops.” The Duke of Sussex, who fought in Afghanistan as a Cavalry officer and Apache helicopter pilot, has told his closest confidants of his excitement at being back in the military fold. A palace source said: “The duke is relishing his role with the Royal Marines and taking it extremely seriously.  “His grandfather Prince Philip carried out his duty with the Marines with such distinction, which Harry particularly admired. “Throughout his military career, Harry always had the greatest of respect and admiration for the Marines and he has always been fascinated by their valour and courage.” The Norway manoeuvres will be the biggest Arctic military exercise by the Royal Marines in decades. It comes amid escalating Russian aggression towards Europe, with Cold War levels of submarine activity reported in the Northern Atlantic and frequent air incursions on UK airspace. And since Putin’s Novichok attack on former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury last year, tensions between London and Moscow have been on a kne-edge.

Including forces from the US and Europe, , soldiers will be involved. Royal Marines started travelling to Norway on New Year’s Day from their base at Bickleigh Barracks in Devon.

Light-armoured Marine vehicles will move in, there are expected to be mortar, rocket, artillery and anti-tank attacks and Marines will ski into action.

Over several days he will be briefed at every stage of the “battle” which will include special forces and commandos spearheading a retaliation against Russian attack. The troops are expected to hold the Northern Flank until British and US reinforcements arrive. Harry’s involvement is not due to be shyofficially announced and the Mirror has agreed not to publish sensitive details of his movements.

In Afghanistan, Harry worked closely with Marines from  Commando. He has killed Taliban fighters and an shyinsurgent commander revealed they had planned to kidnap Harry.

But pub manager Annette Townley - who was also responsible for cooking the food - was unable to cope with the demand and says a combination of overbooking by the previous tenants and latecomers turned Christmas Day into a disaster.

They arrived early for their .pm booking - and by pm no members of staff had approached their table.

I was so upset because I wanted it to be nice for my elderly father-in-law and auntie. They both live on their own and they were really looking forward to it. They must have known they were going to struggle to serve the people who were booked in. Why didn’t they phone us beforehand, so we could have arranged something   Others took to TripAdvisor to share their dismay. One reviewer called it abysmal and said: We booked Christmas Day lunch for pm. Arrived at .pm to find the restaurant full but no food to be seen. When questioned the seated diners said they had been waiting for two hours. As we only live five minutes away we ed home. I was in tears as the day was ruined, we ended up with a pizza. Annette, who took over the Innkeepers Lodge venue in October, said: There were  people booked in. I thought, in October people wouldn’t be able to book anywhere , so I thought I would just try to do it. I did try to phone some people but the numbers in the book weren’t right. On Christmas Day we were ready to go at midday, but the first two parties were late. The knock-on effect of that was phenomenal. I was trying my hardest to catch up. There was nothing I could do.  Asked why the situation was not explained to diners, she said: I did come out to apologise. My waitress did tell people. I spoke to who I could on the day but I just had to keep going. It was absolutely horrible. Ive been doing this for  years and I’ve never had a day like that. Boxing Day and New Year’s Eve went really well – they were bookings I had taken. Christmas Day was a one-off. I can’t apologise enough to people. A spokesman for Innkeepers Lodge said: This was not done with any malice or bad intent. Annette has a good heart and over-estimated her ability to fulfil the bookings. We are very sorry for the disappointment caused to customers.

It took about three hours for police officers to track down his parents while they went house-to-house and put out an urgent appeal. Mr Collins said the boy sat happily in his home where he warmed up and played Lego with his daughter, who was upset when the toddler left with police to be taken to hospital for safeguarding during the search. He said: My little girl cried when the little boy left, as she thought he was here for good. I dont know what will happen to the little boy, but we would be willing to foster him while they sort it out. Mr Collins said he found the toddler wandering in the middle of the road in Main Avenue when he went outside to put something in the bin. He said: He was looking confused. I took his hand and got him to go to the pavement on the opposite side as cars were passing.  Nobody seemed to notice him. I asked two peoplethey knew him. They said no. One said they noticed him wandering up the road. No help there. I saw one of the neighbours coming down Third Avenue in a car. I flagged it down and askedthey knew him. They said they thought he was with me. In the meantime my -year-old son came out with my three-year-old daughter to see where I was. He added: My daughter came skipping across the road and saw the little boy. She immediately started to play with him and they were happy playing. My partner came out and brought some warm clothing and shoes for the boy as he was looking cold. He didnt seem at all fazed by the situation. The police turned up in a car and a van and I told them what I knew and they sent one of their officers to start knocking on doors. I suggested we go into my house as the boy was very cold and pale. We came inside and got warmed up. My little girl sang songs to him. He did not speak much but seemed very happy playing Lego.  My partner changed his nappy as it was dirty. All this took about one-and-a-half hours. The police having no luck finding the parents decided to take him to AE at Torbay Hospital and to seek to put him in care until they could locate the parents and find out what had happened. A local resident, who was at the scene when the boy was found, claimed he had limited speech and he wasnt wearing any shoes or socks.She wrote on social media at the time: I was there when the boy was found. He’s probably  months old. Walking but very limited speech. Didn’t seem at all phased being in a strangers house. Seemed clean but no shoes or socks on. Insane how a child can be missing nearly  hours now and no one have noticed. Makes me wondersomethings happened to the parents  Devon and Cornwall Police have arrested a woman in her s and a man in his s on suspicion of child neglect. The boy is safe and well, the force added. Devon and Cornwall Police said previously: We were called at .pm on January  to reports of young boy being found in the street in Torquay. A woman in her s and a man in his s have been arrested on suspicion of child neglect. They remain in police custody and will be interviewed by specialist child protection officers. The boy has been taken into police protection and is safe. Investigations are ongoing.

A yellow wind warning is in place from Monday January  at pm until pm on Tuesday. The strong winds are likely to cause some delays to road, rail and ferry transport. Some bus and train services might be affected with some journeys taking longer than usual. Short term loss of power and other services are also possible and those on the coast could be affected by spray and large waves.  Meanwhile, the current cold spell is set to continue across much of the UK with temperatures barely climbing above freezing during the day.The coming days will see generally cloudy conditions with some areas experiencing frost for some under clear spells.Some areas will feel like -C as bitter wind chills descend overnight.Friday night will remain cloudy keeping temperatures above freezing. Some breaks in the cloud are likely in the northeast and parts of southern England and Wales where frosts and areas of fog are more likely.Saturday will remain generally dry but cold with a mixture of cloud and some sunny spells. Cloud could thicken enough to bring some spots of light rain over western hills.  Sunday will be cloudy with light rain in northwestern areas, turning less cold. Monday and Tuesday will become windy with coastal gales.Rain is likely to tun into snow in northern areas at the beginning of the week.In the long-term, some forecasters are warning of a repeat of the Beast from the East that caused chaos around this time last year, with freezing temperatures and heavy snow. Met Office scientist Dr Jeff Knight told the Express that weather patterns indicate there could be sudden stratospheric warming in the second half of winter. As a result, temperatures could plunge dramatically across the country and dump heavy snow in many places. Dr Knight said: “In our long-range outlook so far this winter what we have been saying is that the probability of cold happening is probably more likely later in the winter. “So, this year we have got a moderate El Nino event and when we have those what tends to happen is it favours more mild and wet and westerly weather in the early parts of winter.” He added: “I wouldn’t be surprised at allwe were looking at another sudden stratospheric warning in the New Year.” "},{"url":null,"title":"farmfoods slammed 1 kebab chips","story":"NewsFarmfoods slammed for £ kebab and chips meal thats Jeremy Kyle as a dinnerFarmfoods Kebab Meat and Cheesy Chips is just £ - but its not proving popular on social mediaShareCommentsByRobyn DarbyshireAudience Writer:,  JAN NewsTasty  \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailKebab meat and chips is a delicacy normally enjoyed at the end of a night out rather than bought from a shop.However, Farmfoods offer a kebab product you can oven cook yourself - and its been accused of looking like offcuts of a carpet.

The cutting-edge technology is known as ‘Invisible-to-Visible’, or IV, and could entirely change the way we drive. As well as projected avatar passengers demonstrating the best way to drive, the future-tech can even show scenery of a sunny day in the vehicle – when it’s actually raining. The interactive, D display also contains a system using sensors inside and out to anticipate upcoming obstructions. Tetsuro Ueda, an expert leader at the Nissan Research Centre, said: “By helping you see the invisible, IV enhances your confidence and makes driving more enjoyable. “The interactive features create an experience that’s tailored to your interests and driving style so that anyone can enjoy using it in their own way.”  In what Nissan are calling the ‘Metaverse’ – the virtual world that autonomous cars can connect to – it will even be possible for family, friends or others to appear inside the car as three-dimensional, augmented-reality avatars to provide company or assistance. The ‘Metaverse’ maps a -degree virtual space around the car to provide information about things like road and intersection status, visibility, signage or nearby pedestrians.  It can also monitor the people inside the vehicle by using interior sensors to better anticipate when they may need assistance with finding something, or a coffee break to stay alert. Andan obstacle comes up that the car’s automatic systems can’t anticipate, like a fallen tree, control is instantly handed to expert human guides that can remotely offer assistance – like NASA offering guidance on a space mission.  The futuristic tech will be on display at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas from January -. Visitors to CES can experience ‘IV’ at Nissan’s display by putting on a pair of augmented-reality goggles and stepping inside a demonstration cockpit featuring three-dimensional interfaces and displays. Users are guided through scenarios including a tour of a city, receiving help to find an open parking space at a busy mall, seeing a rainy day outside change to a sunny day inside the car, chasing a professional driver avatar to improve driving skills and exploring how IV can see through buildings and around corners.

Airlines and ferry services have been cancelled, leaving many Brits with no choice but to find safe shelter from the approaching storm. Many have been told to bolt their rooms shut and stay inside as the winds, waves and torrential rains grow more intense by the hour.

We are watching huge waves crashing down and everyone at the hotel is nervous and eager to get back to their UK homes. We can’t believe this time yesterday we were sunbathing on the beach. The noise of the wind is very scary. We’ve been told to stay in our rooms  stay safe. The rain is torrential. While winds are currently recorded at around mph, the Met Office said the sustained gales and vastness of the storm make them strong enough to bring down trees and power lines as well as damage buildings. The heavy rainfall also poses a danger to le with risk of flash flooding, sea surges and landslides.

We cannot leave now when it is calm. No boat can take us. A government ban on all boats in the whole of southern Thailand leaving port means we are here all of today. Tomorrow the storm will be nearer us and the weather will be worse and the likelihood of boats leaving presumably nil. By the time the storm is scheduled to be above us on this tiny little island on Sunday we will be at the mercy of it. We just have to wait. Who knows when we will be able to leave.

Darwin Red Cloud made the remarks as he was sentenced this week to four years in prison following the death of his two-month-old son, Dalton, in . He pleaded guilty to second degree murder at an earlier hearing where pictures of the baby boy with “every bone sticking out” were deemed too distressing to show a courtroom. US attorney Sarah Collins said: There are photos that haunt me and this is one of the cases. Red Cloud, , from Rapid City, South Dakota, was originally charged with sexual abuse of a minor, however the charge was dismissed in a plea agreement as well as first degree murder, felony child abuse and neglect charges, according to US media.  The age of the unnamed mother is not known. It was argued in court he was unaware she was underage, but attorney Ms Collins said there was sufficient evidence he knew her age. The court was also told how Red Cloud had “behaved terribly” in jail and that he had a record of four assaults there, spraying disinfectant on other inmates and threatening staff, reports News Center . But Betsey Harris, representing Red Cloud, argued he had learning dficulties and endured a traumatic childhood, growing up without a father.  She added that he didn’t have the “insights to have a baby and to care for a child” and that the death was the result of a “confluence of circumstances,” News Center  added. Red Cloud told the hearing: I’m sorry. I’m not perfect. I’m a human being whose made mistakes. “I may not be the smartest but I know I can do better. I should’ve paid attention more. I’m sorry. Chief Judge Jeffrey L Viken said this case was “highly unusual” and it was “hard to comprehend the signs were missed by so many”. After the hearing, Red Cloud’s sister, Angie Red Cloud, said she didn’t think the baby showed any signs of emaciation.  She said the mother would “bring him down to the house every other day” and says there were a lot of small babies in their family. Red Cars cousin, Kaitlin Catches, also took to Facebook to defend him, reports the .According to the online publication, she wrote: These reporters wanted to know the bad. But I’m so glad the judge seen the good in my cousin  decided to be lenient. No matter what the records or his dysal baby momma said, HE IS NOT A MONSTER!  I’m glad I took the stand to tell these ppl [sic] who HE IS! I don’t want my cousin to take the full responsibility but he is because he knows he was a parent. Although he isn’t the only parent, he chose to own up to it. The prosecutor was trying to make him sound like a monster  give him no less than years. I’m so thankful he will be home soon  able to get the help he needs. Our nightmare is over!!

We controlled the game and had chances to score the second.“We didn’t and then we concede two goals and that is not good. If we want to be top of this league we cannot repeat this mistake.”Painful as the unexpected defeat was, he believes what’s vital now is United put the disappointment of what was only a second defeat since Neilson took charge in October, behind them as quickly as possible.And with home games against Partick Thistle and Dunfermline coming up over the next two Saturdays, he wants the focus to be on what lies ahead and not what’s just gone.“We now just have to think about the next game. We have two games coming now at home and we must think about that and make sure we win them.“Alloa was a very big disappointment but there is still half of the season for us to play and we must put things right. We must keep going and be strong for the rest of the season.“We have been good in most home games and we must make sure that continues.”Since his arrival near the end of the summer transfer window on a two-year contract at Tannadice, Bouhenna has impressed as a hard-tackling centre-half who can also play when he is moving forward with the ball at his feet.Saturday past, however, saw him moved into a midfield holding role and despite the result, put in an impressive performance.For him that change of role was about doing what was needed for the team.“I have played before some games in the midfield. Fraser Fyvie was injured and I will play there because you must always do what is needed for the team.“It was not a surprise because when I came here I played some games in midfield and when the manager asked me to play there I was happy to do it for the team.“I have played some games there during my career. Centre-back is my best position, of course, but I knew I could help the team there and I did it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"at least 10 cops line dundee street after disturbance at home","story":"Police officers were called to Mains Road in Dundee following a disturbance at a house.A witness said the street was “lined” with police cars near to its junction with Dens Road at around am on Wednesday.Officers were seen running towards a close before carrying bags out of the property.A number of residents in the block said they were aware of the police presence but were unsure what had happened.

today vowed to continue to repay the faith shown in him by manager Derek McInnes.The Pittodrie gaffer turned to the -year-old during the Betfred Cup final on December  when Scotland international Gary Mackay-Steven was knocked unconscious in a sickening clash of heads with Dedryck Boyata.Having suffered concussion, Mackay-Steven has been sidelined since, and McLennan started all eight Premiership games packed into December.The Redsof six wins from that run elevated them from the bottom six in the Premiership to within just three points of leaders Celtic and Rangers.For the teenage star it is a position a club of Aberdeen’s stature, having finished league runners-up for the last four seasons, expect to occupy.Mackay-Steven is expected toto action after the winter break but McLennan’s emergence has certainly given McInnes selection options.And McLennan, who has netted twice this season, is ready and willing to start again for the Donsrequired.He said: “The manager has shown faith in me to keep me in the team and hopefully I have repaid him.“I have played since the cup final which has been great for me personally and hopefully I can kick on in the New Year as well.“The manager knows what he is going to get from me and I will do all I can to make sure I am doing the job out on the pitch.“There are some brilliant wingers at the club and it was just about taking that chance when it came.“I was confident enough thatI did get a chance I could go on a wee run.“I think I have done that and we have got some good results in December.”Aberdeen went into the Premiership shut-down just three points behind leaders Celtic and Rangers, with Kilmarnock third.Prior to the League Cup final at the start of December, the Dons had suffered a stuttering start to the league campaign and were languishing in the bottom half of the table.Now, as they ready to jet out for a warm weather training camp on Tuesday, the Reds are in the mix of the most competitive title race for almost a decade.McLennan said: “We have climbed the table in December and racked up the points so hopefully we can push on now in the second half of the season.“For a big club like Aberdeen, up there near the top of the table is where we expect to be.“A club like us needs to be near the top of the table and we will fight to stay there for as long as we can.”Following the injury to Mackay-Steven, Pittodrie youth graduate McLennan was thrown into the deep end – straight into a cup final against double treble winners Celtic and then a trip to Rangers just three days later.Aberdeen rallied from the cup final loss to triumph - at Ibrox with McLennan playing a pivotal role in the victory.Just days after that Old Firm double-header, Aberdeen tied the Peterhead-born talent to an extended contract until summer .McLennan said: “I played through most of December which has been incredible for me.“I want to play in every game, just as every player does.”Having been at Pittodrie since the age of eight, McLennan made his first team debut at  in a - loss to St Johnstone in April . He had to wait more than two years, and via a loan spell at Brechin City, for his first start.That came in the - League Cup defeat of St Mirren in October, where he also scored a spectacular goal.He finished a break-through year with an eighth straight start in the - victory at Livingston.He said: “Livingston had a few good results against some of the good teams in the league so we knew what we would be in for.“We had a game plan and managed to carry that out to get the win we wanted.“When we got the first goal we were comfortably of pushing on and getting another goal.“Even when Livingston scored we were confident enough we could pull through for the win.”"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen community praises impact of rise in students in area","story":"An Aberdeen community has welcomed the impact of an increase in student accommodation developments in and around the area.George Street Community Council said the sht is good news and “beneficial to everybody”.The Combworks on George Street, close to the junction with Hutcheon Street, is the latest development to open, with  student rooms.It follows the opening of Causeway View and Fraser Studios on Causewayend, although these lie just outside the new community council boundary line.A heavy student presence has led to tensions in other communities in the past, but George Street community council chairman Andy MacLeod has not found that to be the case.He said: “As far as George Street Community Council is concerned, we’re really pleased people are living in the centre of town.“We’ve got our concerns should there be a major change in the economy of the area and the universities and number of students goes down, what would happen to the buildings.“But while the universities and colleges are a major part of Aberdeen’s economy, the chance to have a lot of young people living in the area is beneficial to everybody.“It keeps their costs down because they haven’t got to travel miles to get to campus. It has benefits on all sides.“It also releases some of the flats for families to use. We want to work positively with everybody who is in the area.“One of the good things about the Cruyff court that’s opened up is that it’s really well used.“One reason is because of the sheer number of young people in the area.“You go past any time and there’s somebody kicking a ball there, which is really quite good.”Denise Paterson, marketing assistant at the Combworks which opened on September , said: “We’re pleased to be here at the top end of George Street.“The new building has certainly cleaned up the area.“All the students have been welcomed here.

Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"woman admits acting intimidating manner","story":"NewsWoman admits to acting in intimidating mannerThe -year-old shouted, swore and acted in an aggressive and intimidating way towards Shannon Kerr.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  DEC NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has admitted to acting in an intimidating manner.

For Deborah Biggar has just got a whole chunk smaller. The -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier. Deborah, of Dalmellington, revealed a Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis meant she was put on steroids at age just . Even after the first round of steroids she put on two stone. And she said: “I realised I had to do something or my weight would soon be out of control.” She’d kept active as a community support officer and loved horse riding - but had to get out the saddle as her mobility reduced.   Deborah said: “Riding was something I absolutely loved, and also walking, and with this loss of regular activity, I was definitely going to be up against keeping the weight off.” She took the plunge and joined the Coylton branch of WW . She revealed: “I turned up alone and felt very apprehensive. “Due to my illness this wasn’t an easy thing for me to do, as I can be very self-conscious and don’t often go many places on my own, but I needn’t have worried.” Class wellness coach Kellie Brown and her team quickly put Deborah at ease, and she has now only missed one workshop since joining.   During her battle her weight has snowballed up and down as her medications changed. She said: “I am delighted with my weight loss so far as I am feeling much better, not just physically, but I think more importantly, mentally I am in a better place. Going out I do not feel as self-conscious and my confidence is now a lot better. “I went to my nephew’s wedding a happier and much more confident and content person, and looked forward to it, instead of dreading going. “This is all thanks to Kellie and the group I attend at Coylton and this time I will be continuing to attend workshops to help keep me on track.” She tracks calories with an online WW app as she trawls supermarket aisles.   Deborah said: “I love the fact there are so many zero smartpoint foods, and I eat out quite regularly. As long as I track everything and make sensible decisions, I can still lose weight no problem. I sometimes choose what I’m having before I go with the help of my app. I don’t have a sweet tooth so saying no to desserts and cakes is an easy decision for me.” Fatty foods like chips and fried meals have been swapped for fruit, veg, chicken and home-made soup. Trips out are now anxiety free. She revealed: “I am no longer thinking that people are thinking she is only using a stick or scooter because she is fat but they actually see I have a disability. “With my weight loss I am on the list for the Riding for the Disabled Association, and my fingers are crossed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"make-a-date-with-sinatra-and-crosby-this-christmas-in-selkirk","story":"THERES a chance to swing your way into Christmas this weekend in Selkirk with some of the best-known festive hits.Christmas Crooners is coming to Victoria Halls on Sunday as part of their UK tour, now in its tenth record-breaking year.The show features the renowned West-End Singers performing the famous Christmas hits of all the greats, including Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Nat King Cole.They will be showcasing over  of the best-loved festive tunes, such as lsquoDeck the Hallsrsquo, lsquoChestnuts Roastingrsquo and lsquoSanta Babyrsquo, bringing some old-school Christmas glamour to the Borders.Stephen Leatherland, producer and director of the show, said: ldquoIrsquom delighted to be bringing Christmas Crooners to Selkirk and the Border region.\"This fantastic show has brought joy to many people over the last ten years and more, and we look forward to bringing a parcel of Christmas Magic to Selkirk ndash the perfect start to the festive season for young and old alike.Staged in the warm style of the famous Andy Williams Christmas Shows, this production comes complete with Christmas trees, a rocking chair and fireplace.Christmas Crooners is a community-minded event that will bring people together in the local town hall over the Christmas period to celebrate all things festive, with top-quality musicians performing Christmas classics.Hamish Moir, events and programming officer for Live Borders, said: ldquoI canrsquot think of a better way to celebrate the festive season than by heading to the local town hall for an evening of recreating the biggest Christmas hits.\"The Christmas Crooners put on a top quality performance with the West-End singers and Jazz-All-Stars, and we canrsquot wait for them to come to Selkirk for a cosy evening of live music.ldquoWe have a great series of events running over Christmas and in  that would make great gts, and I recommend looking at our website to view the full programme.\"At Live Borders we want to help make communities healthier, happier and stronger, especially at Christmas time, so come and join us on December  for these feel-good hits.Christmas Crooners will be performing in Victoria Halls, Selkirk, on Sunday at :.Tickets, priced at pound., are still available from www.eventbrite or by calling  ."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

But they will be eroded at a pace that will scare uswe are not awake to this threat.Mr Murray said there were no longer any ldquountouchables in Scotland but warned that there was a danger of a long-term ldquodrag on the nationrsquos economygangster infiltration was not stopped.The investigator said the profits of Scotlandrsquos multi-billion drugs industry were not increasingly being laundered at home, in the new corporate equivalent of traditional cash ldquosafe houses.The old safe houses were properties where bulk cash could be stored before being laundered abroad.Mr Murray explained: ldquoCompanies are now being acquired to take the place of safe houses.ldquoThere is always a reason for cash to be in companies. The companies themselves may have an entirely legitimate business but it provides an effective shelter for these funds which are then drawn in through a network of associated companies. This can then provide a story of value or a source of income for organised crime players.ldquoYou could always tell the sort of companies associated with organised crime. Taxi, security and logistics firms, tanning salon and nail bars.ldquoWe are beginning to move away from that now. What we are seeing is that for the serious players in organised crime and looking to acquire business with a good track record, training and good reputation in marketplace.ldquoThe typical scenario is they identity a company which has all of these characteristics but for whatever reason has run in to cash flow dficulties.ldquoIn general, the central belt of Scotland has always been resilient to outside influences. Increasingly the senior players in Scottish organised are engaging with international service providers.One of those foreign iniduals has himself acquired a business in exactly the way I have described.ldquoI think that could be as a result of wishing to de-risk from being directly involved in the physical carriage of drugs.Scotland has increasingly become known overseas as the new Switzerland - with its shell companies offering the same kind of opportunities to hide illicit cash as Swiss bank accounts once did.Mr Murray, however, is not talking about shell companies, such as Scottish limited partnerships, which tend to bank overseas. He is talking about the purchase by gangsters of real-world business which employ real people and do real business in Scotland.And he believes the consequences for failing to deal with this criminalisation could be grave. Mr Murray said: ldquoThe fundamental penalty for allowing an accumulation of criminal cash in the economy is that it is a drag on the economy. It undermines competitiveness, it discourages legitimate players from entering those markets. If it becomes a growing theme in Scotland, it is bound to affect inward investment. I think it is a serious issue."},{"url":null,"title":"we-can-aim-higher-and-do-better-nicola-sturgeon-raises-expectations-of-second-vote-on-scottish-independence","story":"She saidindependence offered Scotland the chance to ldquoaim higher and do better.The First Ministerrsquos declaration came in Twitter exchanges as she dismissed aldquopretty skewed logic a suggestion to make  the year to end the pipe dream of a second vote on Scotlandrsquos future, reports our sister site The Herald.It takes pretty skewed logic to look at Brexit and the general direction of the UK just now and reach this conclusion.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming. The message would be: For Gods sake, lets just stop this madness and get our lives back."},{"url":null,"title":"Today   s feminist activists are wrong to exclude men","story":"Anne Widdicombe might have dismissed it as trivial and whingeing ndash and some #MeTooers undoubtedly deserve that label ndash but the culture of sexual harassment and abuse it calls out is far from unimportant. Equally crucial are other issues that have vexed women for decades,not centuries, among them equality of pay, professional respect and opportunity.So far, so reasonable. Yet, when I heard Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland, talking last week about Mothers of Invention, a podcast she has set up that focusses exclusively on womenrsquos efforts to address climate change, my heart did a double skip: one for delight, two for despair. Delight that women are getting involved directly in trying to help reduce our carbon footprint, without a doubt the most urgent of the worldrsquos ails, but despair at Robinsonrsquos smug assumption that ldquoitrsquos women who change behaviour, in the family and the community.Letrsquos put aside for a moment the fact that, as Robinson reveals in her recent book, Climate Justice, her own awareness of environmental calamity dawned on her like a Damascene conversion astonishingly late in the day. What sets my teeth on edge is the sanctimonious way in which women are increasingly frequently being portrayed ndash mostly by other women. Itrsquos asthere is a collective halo that needs constant polishing, lest it lose its lustre. Indeed, it seems you cannot these days be a female in a position of influence or authority without feeling the urge ndash or the pressure ndash to add a stone to the cairn of womenrsquos rights, entitlements and endeavours.Donrsquot misunderstand me. I am an old-style feminist, and decry utterly the unfair, oppressive and sometimes iniquitous treatment of women in our and other societies. Men have an awful lot to answer for, today and in the past. But I get decidedly uneasy at the perceptual ide that appears to be widening between the sexes. Climate change, said Robinson, is ldquoman-made, and she enjoys using the term, even though admitting it embraces men and women. But apart from this deliberate provocation, is she really correct in assuming that women change attitudes more widely than men Maybe it depends on what sort of country yoursquore living in. When I look around the UK, I donrsquot recognise that stark distinction. Plenty of men seem to be trying to bring about green change, ethical enlightenment, societal improvement, better childcare and education, and are working towards this alongside women. Sometimes, for heavenrsquos sake, they are even taking the lead.Meanwhile, children in two-parent families are open to influences from both parents. While women still tend to spend more time with their young, this does not necessarily equate to a more lasting influence on their behaviour or outlook. The other day my husbandrsquos granddaughter rushed to interrupt her mother who was on the phone to announce that Liverpool had just scored a fourth goal against Newcastle ndash whose influence was that We are going through a phase where almost every interview with a woman politician or banker, entrepreneur or artist, includes the obligatory question about #MeToo, in the same way that every American is asked their opinion of Trump. And while it obviously takes women at the top to help bring about change for those lower down the ladder ndash or in the community at large ndash it is surely not a sacred obligation placed upon each of them. To assume that is to be sexist and discriminatory. Itrsquos certainly not an expectation placed upon men.Yet to listen to some womenrsquos outrage, yoursquod think therersquos a contract, signed at birth, that insists women pay especial attention to female issues eventhere are things that interest them more. Florence Nightingale and Elsie Inglis personally helped save hundreds of lives, and their influence rippled down the decades to the benefit of all, women as much as men. Yet their initial impulse was not to improve things for their own kind, but to help wounded soldiers and the sick and dying. In other words, to improve the conditions of humanity as a whole, not one gender or the other.Of course splinter groups and special interest parties can make things change ndash just look at Dr Inglisrsquos formidable all-women hospitals. There is a galvanising power and collective spirit in female solidarity that nobody can deny. So letrsquos hear it for women tackling climate change. And for men too.In these unsettling and perilous times we surely need to remember that we are all just people. Our identity is not primarily male or female, trans, intersex, other, or whatever label fits. We are simply and essentially human, with all the complexities of personality, type, and biases that entails. Since wersquore in it all together, thatrsquos also how we should sort things out."},{"url":null,"title":"tv-review-luther-is-back-and-guess-who-knocked-on-his-door","story":"Doctor Who BBC ***A SUSPECT sprints into a dockyard, pursued by a Volvo driven by a demon lawman.

Secondly, it also made me realise that in  years we have learnt nothing.Maybe this is why the current year-long UK tour of Les Miserables, originally adapted by Schonberg and writer Alan Boublil from Victor Hugorsquos  novel, has pretty much sold out already.Arriving in Edinburgh this month for the first time in  years for a month-long run, the English-language version of Boublil and Schonbergrsquos show has been a fixture of the London theatre circuit since Trevor Nunn directed a co-production between the Royal Shakespeare Company and Cameron Mackintosh at the Barbican in .This makes it the second longest-running musical in the world.Despite the success of putting Hugorsquos story charting ex-convict Jean Valjeanrsquos travails through poverty-stricken France onstage, Schonberg for one isnrsquot quite sure of the reasons why it happened.ldquoItrsquos a phenomenon I donrsquot really understand, the now -year old composer admits of a creation which introduced the world to songs now regarded as modern classics such as I Dreamed A Dream, ldquobut the show is more popular than ever. I must say, Irsquom totally surprised.By the time Les Miserables opens at the Festival Theatre in Edinburgh, the new six-part TV adaptation of Hugorsquos book scripted by Andrew Davies will be mid-way through its own run. With Dominic West playing Valjean as part of a cast that includes Olivia Coleman and David Oyelowo, rather than claiming kin with Boublil and Schonbergrsquos take on things, advance publicity appears to pointing up the fact that it is categorically not the musical, and shouldnrsquot be confused as such. Viewers and critics have already criticised this sans songs version as being flat.With Les Mis the musical itself filmed in  with Hugh Jackman as Valjean, this too is something Schonberg doesnrsquot understand.ldquoWhenever I read an article about the BBC version, they are saying it is the real version of the novel and not the trivial musical stage version, he says.ldquoI donrsquot know how you can promote something against it. People know the title because of the musical show, but each time therersquos an adaptation, they all make the point that they are not going to have anyone singing. But who knows  This one might be very good. I will look at it carefully.Schonberg probably doesnrsquot need to worry too much. As he points out, there has been more than  films based on Hugorsquos novel, with over  TV adaptations as well as another  dferent versions onstage. This is how great stories work as they are reimagined for every age. Indeed, it was another musical adaptation of a nineteenth century novel that was the starting point for Les Miserables.ldquoAlain saw Oliver! in London, says Schonberg, who had previously collaborated with Boublil on La Revolution Francaise, Francersquos first rock opera, produced in . ldquoI said to Alain, next time we find a big subject, we have it as a sung-through musical, and when Alain saw Oliver!, that gave us an idea about how to do it.Lionel Bartrsquos musical version of Charles Dickensrsquo novel, Oliver Twist, had already been adapted for film by Carol Reed in  by then, after being first seen on the West End eight years earlier. Prior to putting Les Miserables onstage, as was the fashion then, Boublil and Schonberg released a recording of it as a concept album. This approach had already paid idends for the English musical theatre team of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita, and Schonberg had already scored hit records in France.Three years after the Les Miserables concept album had led to the showrsquos original French production, it was heard by British producer Cameron Mackintosh after it was passed on to him by director Peter Farago.ldquoTwo years after the show closed in Paris, Cameron was organising his records and put it on, Schonberg recalls. ldquoand after that we heard he was looking for those crazy French guys, Schonberg and BoublilWhile the pair worked on new drafts of Les Miserables, Mackintosh was riding high on the success of Cats, directed by Trevor Nunn, who had also overseen David Edgarrsquos epic staging of Dickensrsquo Nicholas Nickleby, and knew how to put on a big show. Success was far from guaranteed, however, and the opening night of Les Mis was a critical disaster.ldquoThe critics were very bad,rsquo says Schonberg, actually using the v word eight times. ldquoCameron has a tradition of having a lunch the day after an opening night, and it was like a funeral. We thought it was finished, and during the lunch Cameron kept trying to call the box office to measure the scale of the disaster, but couldnrsquot get through. Eventually he received a message to say that the reason he couldnrsquot get through was that the show had sold , tickets, and in two weeks would be sold out.Les Miserables went on to win an Olivier Award for the most popular show, while on Broadway it won three Tony awards.The current touring version is directed by Laurence Connor and James Powell for a production reinvigorated for the showrsquos th anniversary in . The result is a very st century Les Mis, which utilises projections based on paintings by Hugo created by son et lumiere auteurs Fty-Nine Productions. The internationally renowned team led by Leo Warner and Mark Grimmer, who have come a long way since their early work at the Traverse Theatre, the National Theatre of Scotland and with Stellar Quines Theatre Company.Having worked worldwide on the National Theatrersquos production of War Horse and the  Olympics, more recently  have been responsible for opening events of the Edinburgh International Festival, Deep Time, Bloom and the First World war-themed Five Telegrams. The latter projected images onto the walls of the Usher Hall accompanied by a thundering score by Anna Meredith.ldquoThere have been so many improvements to Les Miserable this year,rsquo says Schonberg. ldquoThat has a lot to do with technological developments which wouldnrsquot have been possible even five years ago.This keeps the show fresh for several generations of theatre-goers, as was proven last week, when Schonberg met a woman who told him how shersquod seen Les Miserables a staggering  times.ldquoFor Christmas she was taking her children and grand-children to see the show with hr again,rsquo he says.What Les Miserables taps into, again, Schonberg isnrsquot sure about. All he can say is that ldquoI think we did the right job, but it is the novel that is responsible for the success of the show, and for whatever reason, people seem to leave the theatre a bit dferent. People are scared for the future. Theyrsquore all looking for a bright tomorrow and waiting for the sun to shine, and people come out of the show perhaps believing they can be a better person.Les Miserables, Festival Theatre, Edinburgh, January -February .www.capitaltheatreswww.lesmis"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9245391.jpg?type=article-full","title":"burnin-the-clavie-alistair-heather-in-scots-on-a-tradition-thats-aulder-than-scotland","story":"The Clavie is the flamin Archangel Tar half-barrel that gets cairtit roon Burgheid ilka auld new year, the th o Janurary.

But he declined to give any details of the buyer or the company bought.He stressed that Scottish underworld figures, who have traditionally protected their own turf from overseas gangsters, were also actively purchasing distressed real-world businesses to expand their grip well beyond their heartlands in the poorest communities of the Central Belt.BACKGROUND:Police chief saysScotland must wake up to threat of criminals taking over businessIn an exclusive interview with The Herald, Mr Murray effectively sounded a wake-up call about the threat of organised crime infiltration into Scotlandrsquos legitimate economy.The investigator said: ldquoWe are lucky in Scotland. We have strong institutions and professions. We have lots of natural strengths.

The companies themselves may have an entirely legitimate business but it provides an effective shelter for these funds which are then drawn in through a network of associated companies. This can then provide a story of value or a source of income for organised crime players.ldquoYou could always tell the sort of companies associated with organised crime. Taxi, security and logistics firms, tanning salon and nail bars.ldquoWe are beginning to move away from that now. What we are seeing is that for the serious players in organised crime and looking to acquire business with a good track record, training and good reputation in marketplace.ldquoThe typical scenario is they identity a company which has all of these characteristics but for whatever reason has run in to cash flow dficulties.ldquoIn general, the central belt of Scotland has always been resilient to outside influences. Increasingly the senior players in Scottish organised are engaging with international service providers.One of those foreign iniduals has himself acquired a business in exactly the way I have described.ldquoI think that could be as a result of wishing to de-risk from being directly involved in the physical carriage of drugs.BACKGROUND:Police chief saysScotland must wake up to threat of criminals taking over businessScotland has increasingly become known overseas as the new Switzerland - with its shell companies offering the same kind of opportunities to hide illicit cash as Swiss bank accounts once did.Mr Murray, however, is not talking about shell companies, such as Scottish limited partnerships, which tend to bank overseas. He is talking about the purchase by gangsters of real-world business which employ real people and do real business in Scotland.And he believes the consequences for failing to deal with this criminalisation could be grave. Mr Murray said: ldquoThe fundamental penalty for allowing an accumulation of criminal cash in the economy is that it is a drag on the economy. It undermines competitiveness, it discourages legitimate players from entering those markets. If it becomes a growing theme in Scotland, it is bound to affect inward investment.

The only thing that ies is which party itrsquos coming from. The script itself is always much the same.Yet, while the electorate remains sceptical of Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnellrsquos overall economic strategy of aping Venezuela, the policy of renationalising rail attracts considerable support. This is despite the fact that, as often as not, problems that affect rail travellers are the responsibility of the UK Government-owned Network Rail, and that two-thirds of the cost of running our railways is provided by Scottish Government subsidy. The increases here, meanwhile, though well ahead of the general rate of inflation, are actually slightly lower than those south of the Border.Whatrsquos more, the parts of the UKrsquos railways that are privatised compare very favourably with the old British Rail and with rail networks in other countries. The last major comparison of European rail networks, five years ago, found that the UK had improved in efficiency and customer satisfaction more than any of the other  countries examined, while, in terms of passenger kilometres, rail use has almost doubled since , from . per cent of all journeys to nearly nine per cent now. Itrsquos also the safest in the EU .A recent report by the Centre for Policy Studies concluded that the cost of fares is almost the only measure on which UK rail compares badly with other countries. And though you would never think it from talking to rail users or from media coverage, the UK scores highest in terms of customer satisfaction of the six largest European networks , according to a Eurobarometer poll last September.That certainly wouldnrsquot have been the case when the railways were last entirely in public ownership, but then nostalgia for some ldquogolden age of rail transport is usually misplaced. The best services, in terms of both comprehensive coverage and affordability were during the late Victorian age, when there were about  dferent private companies, and after theto private ownership in , when the ldquoBig Four ran a very effective service.Between then and the outbreak of the Second World War, they conveyed more passengers than the total carried in the United States and, during the s, covered more passenger miles, despite the vast dference in distances. And did so while saving pound million ndash  per cent of expenditure ndash over that period. By , savings were at a rate of poundm per year. The only comparable increase in productivity, in fact, has been since the reprivatisation of the s.The postwar period of nationalised British Rail, by contrast, was marked by continual decline ndash not helped, of course, by the ldquoreforms imposed in  by Dr Beeching, which saw a quarter of the network axed.Much of this, of course, had causes other than the way in which the rail system was owned and operated. The growth of private car ownership was almost certainly the major factor. But it does suggest that nationalisation is not an automatic way of improving performance.And that figure of nine per cent of all passenger kilometres travelled, evenit is a substantial rise, indicates that rail travellers are in a small minority, especially when you take into account that people are more likely to take the train for longer journeys. Almost  per cent of people in the UK didnrsquot get on a train at all last year, while the average number of rail journeys for the whole population was two, for a total distance of  miles. Given that many peoplecommute more than  miles daily by train, rail ndash though it gets the most attention of any aspect of public transport ndash does not matter to vast sections of the population.Ah, you say, but more people would travel by trainthe fares were reasonable, as they are in most other European countries. That may be true, though the system is stretched beyond its capacity just now, so it may not be a terric idea. One indication of that strain is that total passenger journeys have doubled over the last decade, but the number of trains being run has increased by  per cent.The chief reason that fares are cheaper on the Continent, however, is that they are subsidised from general taxation or rather, more subsidised than under our system. Rail travel itself isnrsquot cheaper where, itrsquos just that the cost is distributed dferently. The French taxpayer, for example, pays twice as much as the UK citizen towards the railways.There doesnrsquot seem to me to be an overwhelming argument for getting taxpayers, rather than rail travellers, to pay for trains. Especially since most people seldom or never use them and ndash across great swathes of the country, particularly outside the large metropolitan areas ndash couldnrsquot, eventhey wanted to.Since itrsquos also true that most British rail users are richer than the average member of the public, and that almost  per cent of rail journeys are to get to work, or for business purposes, the case for greater subsidy of rail fares is, in reality, an argument for getting ordinary taxpayers to subsidise firms in large cities, and thefairly well-paid professionals who work in them.Evenyou still wanted the poorer taxpayer, whose only transport option may be an inadequate bus service, to subsidise rich commutersrsquo fares, itrsquos not an argument for nationalisation. Yoursquod just spend the money on direct subsidy of fares. In fact, the additional costs of nationalisation, and the decline in service that previous experience suggests would go with it, would make cutting fares even less affordable."},{"url":null,"title":"the-herald-diary-are-we-running-from-the-english-again","story":"THERES been a lot of Billy Connolly on the telly recently.

Neither stance is particularly compatible with goodwill to all men but it is indicative of our nations uncomfortable and seemingly unshtable relationship with our own health.There is a blind and socially acceptable hatred for vegans because we cant stand feeling judged. Even quiet vegans, those who dont picket restaurants or hover in balaclavas with placards on the high street, are scorned.Their mere existence is a comment on our bacon guzzling, planet destroying ways. Vegetarians are alright, they still eat cheese. This is why the vegetarian McDonalds Happy Meal was received with barely a blink you dont feel undermined by a vegetarian, they have their flaws.Vegans are walking embodiments of virtue, silently chiding us for all our flaws.Of course, the impression is a crude one. There are strong arguments that grazing cattle are much more beneficial to the environment than industrially grown maize, grains and soya, as one example.Veganism is rapidly entering the mainstream, however.

Itrsquos amazing to think that his greatest invention was perfected in Borsquoness, and that the building in which he did so can still be seen, adjacent to Kinneil House. Hopefully, our efforts will make people more aware of this great Scot and his amazing contributions that changed the world.The cottage, the only surviving building in Scotland directly linked to Wattrsquos pioneering work, was specically built to allow Watt to test his steam power theories well away from the prying eyes of industrial spies desperate for a glimpse of what he was up to.He had been struck by an idea for a dramatically improved kind of steam engine while repairing a Newcomen steam engine and realising how much energy was wasted by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder.He realised a separate chamber to condense the steam could boost power and be far more fuel efficient. However, his hopes of testing his theory with working models were hampered by a shortage of funds and lack of space in his Glasgow workshop.Industrialist Dr John Roebuck, owner of the Carron Iron Works in Falkirk, stepped in to offer Watt funds to work on and patent his revolutionary steam condenser design in exchange for a share of the profits from the patent.Roebuckrsquos Carron Iron Works ndash which itself played a key role in the industrial revolution producing carronade canons for the Duke of Wellington, kitchen ranges, pillar boxes and bath tubs ndash provided a source of iron and workmanship for Wattrsquos prototypes, while his Kinneil estate offered privacy and access to the nearby Gil Burn to help power a full-size test engine.In a letter to Roebuck, Watt wrote: ldquoOn considering the engine to be erected with you, I think the best place will be to erect a small house in the glen behind Kinneil.ldquoThe burn will afford us plenty of cold water, and we will be more free from speculation than we can be about Borsquoness.While his patent was lodged on January , , his tests were hindered as Carron Iron Worksrsquo workers struggled to create Wattrsquos exact requirements for workable components.It wasnrsquot until  and with Roebuck bankrupt, that Birmingham industrialist Matthew Boulton stepped in to provide finance and links to experienced mechanics who could help create his vision.Apart from a large cast iron engine cylinder which remains at the Kinneil site, Wattrsquos equipment was dismantled and moved to Boultonrsquos iron foundry in Birmingham. Within a year Wattrsquos first large steam engines were providing the power needed to drive forward mills and factories, and the industrial revolution was fully under way.Wattrsquos workshop cottage went on to become a laundry house and eventually fell into disrepair. Today all that marks its unique role in the industrial revolution is a small information .Ian Shearer, chairman of Friends of Kinneil, said: ldquoThe whole site should be an important visitor attraction. In many ways James Wattrsquos Cottage at Kinneil was the crucible of the engineering revolution that spread across the UK and across the world. The cottage stands directly on the line of the Roman Antonine Wall which runs through Kinneil Estate, and is where most of Wattrsquos development work took place.Professor Colin McInnes, James Watt Chair, Professor of Engineering Science at the University of Glasgow, said: ldquoJames Wattrsquos contribution to engineering cannot be understated, key to which was the step change in efficiency he delivered through the separate steam condenser.ldquoHis initial is stamped on every light bulb, measuring the electrical power it delivers, but also reminding us of the sheer intellectual light he brought to the world."},{"url":null,"title":"vince-cable-urges-theresa-may-to-end-brinkmanship-over-security-in-n-ireland","story":"The call from Sir Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, came as the issue of the Irish border and the row over the backstop ndash the guarantee that the border would remain open ndash continued to be the impasse to securing the UK-EU deal on Brexit.Police officers, north and south of the border, are due to begin training this month after Police Service of Northern Ireland[PSNI] chiefs requested reinforcements to deal with any trouble that might arise from reviving a hard border.But Sir Vince called on Theresa May to take a no-deal scenario off the table to avoid anyof such a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.ldquoThe Brexiteers claims that the security of Northern Ireland is not at risk as a result of Brexit have been further dismantled by these reports.

who lives in Thurso, has been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Years Honours List in recognition of his services to the community in Caithness. He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Saturday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

The track could also accommodate a number of other activities.\"He said the track, which is  metres long and eight metres wide, has been laid out but needs to be tarred.The layout of the track has been paid for by donations as well as money from the Baillie Wind Farm fund.

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue. The move from loan schemes to direct payments and other schemes meeting set payment deadlines will build trust within the sector in the post-Brexit era and aid the organisation and planning of farm businesses in uncertain times.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But no.As their -day recess draws to a close, there came an extraordinary suggestion from former Brexit Secretary David Davis. Rather than get on with the post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union that British businesses desperately need, he claimed Theresa May should delay the vote on her unpopular plan for a second time.According to Davis, the UK can still achieve much better terms with the EU but onlyit waits until “the eleventh hour”. Despite the EU’s insistence that no other deal is on the table, Davis said waiting until the last moment would force a rethink. “Time is our friend,” he wrote in the , “the more we prepare to leave the EU without a deal, the more likely a good deal becomes.”: Brexit: Theresa May urged to delay meaningful vote for a second timeThe reason, he claimed, was that the EU was worried about the loss of the £ billion that is the UK’s share of EU liabilities. Essentially, he is suggesting that the UK Government plays a game of chicken with the EU until the moments before  March. The trouble is,there is a crash, it is the UK economy that is likely to be wrecked while the EU juggernaut continues on with perhaps a few dents.This astonishingly cavalier and reckless suggestion epitomises too many pronouncements from the hard Brexiteers in parliament. It is also fundamentally dishonourable. The £bn is the UK’s share of liabilities for things like civil servants’ pensions. It should not be used as a bargaining chip. Failing to pay would be like going out to dinner with  other people and then leaving without paying your share of the bill because you had a disagreement. If the UK does not pay up, it will damage our reputation on the international stage as a country that subscribes to the rule of law, that can be trusted, that pays its debts. The suggestion we might not pay should be discarded along with wild ideas that post-Brexit UK could start selling knock-off ‘Champagne’.MPs need to hold the “meaningful vote” on May’s deal as soon as possible to establish whether it is politically viable or not. Businesses and investors need to have an idea of what the UK is going to be like in less than three months’ time. Any sensible politician should understand this.

That is not just something to say to mark the start of , it is also an expression of ambition and hope. And one which is in our power to realise in what is a milestone year for Scotland.This year is the th anniversary of the establishment of the Scottish Parliament. It is therefore an ideal opportunity to assess where we are as a country, whether we have achieved all that we thought we would and what we will need to do dferently.Like thousands of others in the Scottish Labour Party, the trade union movement, and wider civic Scotland I campaigned for a Scottish Parliament and I was proud to do so. The Parliament we wanted – and still do – is one that provides a  to lt families out of poverty, to tackle injustice. Ultimately, to change and improve people’s lives. We wanted a Parliament for real change, to exercise power for a purpose, not just for its own sake.The late Donald Dewar – former Labour MP and Scotland’s inaugural First Minister – reflected this in his speech at its opening. That speech was full of ambition and of hope. He said the Parliament was about much more than politics and the laws that would be passed by MSPs, he said that it was about “who we are, how we carry ourselves”. This was a vision of a Parliament for Scotland not just as an end in itself but, he said, as “a means to greater ends”.Twenty years on, what has happened to that ambition  How can we carry ourselves with pride and purpose when one in four children spent this Christmas living in poverty  When our public services are so under-resourced that health boards are on the brink of going bust when teachers and parents are having to sound alarm bells about the state of our education system and when  workers at the Kaiam computer plant in Livingston can be told on Christmas Eve that they no longer have a job despite, we now know, ministers knowing weeks in advance that the firm would likely close.Labour has called for an inquiry in the Kaiam closure. We want to look at it as a specic case but also the questions it raises about how the Scottish Government uses financial assistance, how the money gets spent, what systems are in place to account for it, who is responsible and how sustainable it is.: HES collapse: Waste firm ceases operations after backlog controversyThat’s why, in the last few days, I have met with workers from Healthcare Environmental Servicesin Shotts who, in a viable business they have helped to build, find themselves without pay, without a job and facing the need to take court action to secure what they are owed. We really need a fundamental review of the balance of power between workers and owners in a situation like this: and we need to find a solution to rescue what we can to safeguard these jobs and good standards of public and environmental health.Labour has a vision for the future, of how to rebalance our economy to prevent these closures from happening so we are not just reacting to industrial change – because Kaiam and HES are far from the first and,we carry on as we are, they won’t be the last. Over the last  years, Scotland’s manufacturing base has shrunk and the service sector has grown – and at the same time we have witnessed a rise in insecure work, low pay and worsening terms and conditions.We need a much more proactive, forward-looking planned approach that involves workers, instead of regarding the threat to their livelihoods as the unfortunate consequence of the inevitable decline of industry. We often talk about this as being an ‘industrial strategy’ but really it ought to be common sense.And that applies whether it’s Michelin in Dundee or Ferguson Marine, Tata Steel, and BiFab – where this time last year Labour and the unions were applauding the Government for stepping in, but where now we are left with three yards, only with no workers in them.It goes without saying that we need a better approach, one that ties together investment in yards like these – so they have the right infrastructure and the workers have the right skills – with investment in offshore renewable energy technology. Our approach would bring together industrial leaders and trade unions to plan ahead.For too long, politicians have allowed ‘the market’ – which in reality means big business and wealthy speculators – to run our economy. It hasn’t been run in the interests of people. Labour would do things very dferently. We want to give workers the right to buy their businessit is put up for sale or facing closure. This is common in other European countries, they’ve had something like this in Italy for  years.: Kaiam boss tells workers: ‘I’m sorry, I failed’We also want to see more democracy in our economy. We live in a country that was once at the cutting edge of the co-operative movement, where workers own and run their enterprise, sharing in the gains and ensuring everyone benefits, not just a privileged few. I would like to see Scotland becoming a beacon for this kind of ownership model once again.These are big challenges that risk being overshadowed and overlooked. Over the last few years, too many politicians have been guilty of offering one-trick solutions to multi-sided problems, whether that’s independence or Brexit.But Brexit actually makes all of these things more immediate and important. It is why I have consistently said that we can’t allow it as an issue in and of itself to ert our attention from issues like housing shortages and homelessness, or the rise in the use foodbanks, and generally from the transformative changes we need to make to our economy.It is also why I believe constantly trying to revive the idea of another independence referendum is an unnecessary and dangerous distraction. To view everything through this prism is an abdication of responsibility. The last thing we need is more instability and chaos, what we need is real change of the kind many of us hoped and campaigned for  years ago.I believed then in devolution and I still do. No one can predict what this year will bring. But Scottish Labour will put that spirit of ambition and hope that marked the start of the Parliament in  at the heart of everything we do in .©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4851955.1546613397!/image/image.jpg","title":"government planning live test of disruption caused by no deal brexit","story":"The Government is to use up to  lorries in a major test of its plans for UK border disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit.A “live test” on Monday will examine the proposal to use Manston airfield near Ramsgate as a mass “HGV holding facility” to alleviate congestion on the roads to the Channel ports, the Department for Transport has confirmed.In a letter to hauliers, obtained by Sky News, DfT and Kent County Council officials say they would run tests during the morning rush hour at am, and again at am, to “establish the safest optimum release rate of HGVs” from the airfield to Dover along the A.It said it would pay for - hauliers from the local area to take part in the test of Operation Brock.The news came after it was reported that Theresa May was due to speak with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker on Friday as she seeks added flexibility in the Withdrawal Agreement.: No way DUP will back Brexit dealMPs are due to debate the PM’s Brexit deal on Wednesday ahead of a meaningful vote the following week but the EU has yet to offer any changes.A DfT spokeswoman said: “We do not want or expect a no-deal scenario and continue to work hard to deliver a deal with the EU.“However, it is the duty of a responsible Government to continue to prepare for all eventualities and contingencies, including a possible no deal.“We will be testing part of Operation Brock to ensure that,it needs to be implemented, the system is fully al.”Congestion at the Channel ports caused by the reintroduction of customs checks on goods has been one of the most commonly cited negative impacts of a no-deal withdrawal from the EU at the end of March.However a poll of Conservative Party members has dealt a new blow to Mrs May’s chances of getting her deal through the Commons, with % of grassroots Tories saying they would support leaving the EU without an agreement.: Nearly two-thirds of Tory members back no-deal BrexitThe DUP has also maintained its opposition to the plan because of the proposed customs “backstop” element of the deal - affecting the Northern Ireland Ireland border - agreed by Mrs May with Brussels.Its Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said on Friday there is no way his party can support the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal,He told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “It’s not just because of the regulations which Northern Ireland would be subject to with the backstop, but also the fact we would have to treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country, we would not participate in any trade deals which the United Kingdom may enter into in the future and we would find that there would be a border down the Irish Sea, which would impede trade with our biggest trading partner, namely GB.”DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds insisted his party’s opposition to Irish border backstop proposals had not lessened after a meeting with the Prime Minister on Thursday.Mr Dodds said: “The Withdrawal Agreement, as currently proposed, flies in the face of the Government’s commitments on Northern Ireland as we leave the EU.”Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said a second EU referendum would “trigger a very populist reaction” and would further ide the UK.Speaking to German newspaper Die Welt he said: “The current rate at which Britain is torn would be small compared to the tensions that a second vote would cause.“It would continue to split our nation.”The comments echoed his Cabinet colleague Jeremy Hunt, after the Foreign Secretary said earlier this week that the consequences for democracy of another referendum would be “devastating”.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4831246.1546591644!/image/image.jpg","title":"poll 57 of conservative members back no deal brexit","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Theresa May#s bid to get Tory MPs to back her Brexit plan suffered a set-back as a new poll suggested more than half of Conservative Party members prefer a no-deal withdrawal.In a three-way choice,  per cent of grassroots Tories said they would support leaving the EU without an agreement, while  per cent would back the Prime Minister’s deal and  per cent would choose to remain.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing.

The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland. was a milestone in a changing Ireland. It was given voice in the Repeal referendum. In Belfast the largest political demonstration was Pride. For this generation the border is an anachronism. When the Repeal result was read out a sign was held aloft, ‘The North is next’. Rights transcend borders and so does this generation. will mark the centenary of the First Dáil. A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern Ireland residents to look out for vulnerable relatives after two people robbed of thousands Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8756119.1546445050!/image/image.jpg","title":"st colman s have a super tour","story":"Local families attending the Family Health Initiative at St Colman#s Primary School recently visited Moundview Eurospar in Dromore for a supermarket tour.The Family Health Initiative is a healthy lestyle programme delivered by Early Years- the organisation for young children in the Southern Trust and is funded by the Public Health Agency.During the supermarket tour both parents and children took part in a fantastic scavenger hunt to find all the healthy food items on their sheet.

Or, more accurately, David Stitt BSc Hons is on Twitter. Arlene Foster’s erstwhile photo companion has been busying himself of late on the Kilcooley bonfire in Bangor, which he’s determined to ensure is the biggest and the best in Are Wee Country.First up, Squinter’s not sure what Science Dee is a Bachelor of Honours in – the UDA man doesn’t say. But from the tweets about the appliance of structural engineering science to the massive edice, it might appear that it is in that field of endeavour that he excelled at university. We might be tempted to speculate on what university handed the qualication over to him, given the quality of the spelling on his Twitter account, but let’s stick to the matter in hand.On Thursday, as the bonfire crept out of the North Down troposphere and into the stratosphere, Dee gave vent to the vaunting pride that’s filling his barrel chest as the race for the title of Biggest Boney came down to the final furlong: “Kilcooley Bonfire, Well on its way to be Ulster Biggest . A Military Operation, being constructed by Structural Engineers for safety.” Across the Pravince, men of substance nodded slowly and gravely and gave thanks that the health and safety of the children of the large estate is in such professional hands. Next day the Kilcooley boney fell down.AUGUSTAN open letter from Emma Little Pengelly, DUP South Belfast MP, on the Glidergate scandal#Thank you for giving me space in your paper to lay out my position on the Woodstock Road Glider stop, erroneously referred to by some as the ‘Short Strand’ Glider stop, among them the people who designed and built the Glider system and the people closest to it.It has been alleged that I have never before shown an interest in bus stops.. Nothing could be further from the truth. At university I was a founder member of the ‘Campaign to Save Ulster Bus Stops’ and I wrote a very well-received pamphlet which I distributed to membersentitled ‘Classic Bus Stops of Markethill and Richhill – Ulster’s Hidden History’. Furthermore, I have on occasion been on a bus, although admittedly not for a while. That the Glider stop I referred to is near the Short Strand is not in question, but since when did geographical proximity have anything to do with naming things  The Donegal Celtic football club on the Suffolk Road is not in Donegal. The Dublin Road is not in Dublin. Even the Woodstock Road is not in Woodstock, which most people are unaware of . So calling the stop Short Strand because it is near the Short Strand makes zero sense and is in fact potentially confusing. What is this place coming to when routes can’t be changed or amended just because they are traditional  SEPTEMBERSCOTLAND’S Shame, it’s called – the ,lb gorilla in the Holyrood Parliament that nobody wants to speak about. Many and frequent are the manestations of anti-Catholic sentiment at the very core of Scottish society, but the antics this week of a senior Labour Party official at the party conference in Liverpool has seen the issue reach a wider audience and that may make it rather more dficult for it to remain a dirty secret. Speaking from the , Scotsman Andy Kerr, Chairman of the Labour Party’s ruling National Executive Committee, invited a woman to speak and then added: “Did you cross yourself there  In that case I might not.” Not surprisingly, the ‘joke’ went down like a fart in a space suit as Andy obviously forgot that he wasn’t speaking before a select audience in Glasgow. The apology wasn’t long coming “unreservedly” with Andy adding: “I was trying to be lighthearted but what I said was ill-judged and wrong.” Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: “People from all parties and none will be appalled by this and by the casual dismissal of concerns.” Much as Squinter cheered Ruth’s decisive intervention, he must reluctantly point out that her party has blotted its copybook in the recent past when it comes to the matter of Catholics in Scotland. Last year a Conservative member of Stirling Council was readmitted to the party after being suspended for posting anti-Catholic comments online. Alastair Majury tweeted: “Why is the Catholic Church against birth control  Because they#ll run out of children to molest.”Of course, had Andy Kerr made a religiously loaded remark like the one he did about Catholics about, say, Muslims, or Jews, he wouldn’t have seen the end of the day. But in situ he remains, at the very heart of a party currently struggling with allegations of anti-Semitism which so far have not been solid enough to see any heads roll. The Zionist lobby which is after Jeremy Corbyn’s head would surely have claimed their first victory had this remark been aimed in the direction of Judaism. Perhaps you’ll remember that in July the Orange Order called off a parade in Glasgow. They called it off rather than obey a direction not to walk past a Catholic church where at a previous Orange Order march a priest had been spat at and struck with a baton by parade followers. Now the socialists have joined the KKK. Jings, crivvens, help m’boab!OCTOBERWHAT IS THE BACKSTOP The factsAn insurance policydesigned to avoid a hard border in the event that a customs agreement cannot be agreed by the end of the transition period . If no agreement is reached, the EU wants to see the north remaining in the Single Market and Customs Union until London comes up with a solution. Under pressure from hardliners, British Prime Minister Theresa May wants the backstop done away with or, at the very least, subject to a time limit.The loyal Ulster factsKeeping the Pravince in the Single Market and Customs Union while the rest of the UK leaves is an existential threat to the future of Are Wee Country and the DUP is battling to “save the union”. The party is clear that there can be no ergence within the UK, except on things that it wants to erge on, gyeh morrage and abortion, for instance. A DUP source has promised to up the pressure on the Tory government: “We are going to squeeze their balls until their ears bleed.”Promises, promises# NOVEMBERWhich brings us to James McClean. Again. Since last year’s Remembrance Day festival the Derry native and Republic of Ireland international has switched clubs from West Brom to Stoke. In order to keep their fans informed ahead of the annual wearing of the poppy football shirts across the English leagues, the club issued a brief statement outlining the player’s historical stance and confirming that he wouldn’t be sporting a poppy on his shirt this year either.Despite the fact that nothing had changed – other than the name of the club at the top of the press release – the statement sent the Pravince’s media to DefCon , just as it has since the day and hour James spoke his first words on the topic, occasioning the familiar angry social media blast from Ulster’s stout yeomanry. There’s a delicious and very fitting circularity in this local saga:just as nothing has changed in relation to James McClean and the poppy, nothing has changed in Ulster’s attitude to it.DECEMBERA BURNING question finally gets its answer. No, it’s not about Brexit, or world hunger, or famine or plague. It’s simply this: what do you call this item pictured below left  You may never have given the matter any thought, but Squinter has, because, well# because that’s the kind of guy he is. Fact of the matter is that you’re very unlikely ever to ask for one because  out of every thousand of these things sold are simply lted by the customer and brought to the counter or check-out without a word. If you have a shopping list it will simply say ‘milk’ and everyone knows exactly how large or how small their milk requirements are.But every time Squinter buys one he asks himself why he doesn’t have a clue what it’s called and, further,a tourist asked him what it was he wouldn’t be able to answer. So, enough being enough, Squinter put the question to Twitter – and back came around  replies, some of them fairly sensible, some#. Quart.. Barrackbuster.. Big milk.. Flagon Jar.. Green milk..

That gap in our knowledge has now been put right with the the timely publication of the powerful ‘War Against All Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America’s Colony’ by accomplished journalist Nelson A. Denis. His book sweeps through the many humiliations heaped on Puerto Ricans after the US invasion of , such as a ban on Spanish in schools and a prohibition against the flying of the nation’s flag. Where the American government led, business followed. Suffocating poverty on the island and slave-like conditions on the sugar plantations worsened. The first civilian governor Charles Allen ed to the US and leveraged his contacts and influence to become the King of Sugar. “By ,” writes Denis, “Allen and US banking interests had converted  per cent of all arable land in Puerto Rico into sugar plantations. These bank syndicates also owned the insular postal system, the entire coastal railroad, and the international seaport of San Juan.”Patriots responded with their own Nationalist Party but its ranks were riddled with FBI informers and when that didn’t stymie its growth, supporters were massacred in the town of Ponce. On Sunday March  , a parade of unarmed nationalist cadets was effectively ambushed by police in scenes similar to our own Bloody Sunday. “The police kept shooting and clubbing for thirteen minutes,” says Denis. “By the time they finished,  men, one woman and a seven-year-old girl lay dead over  more were gravely wounded — moaning, crawling, bleeding, and begging for mercy in the street.# marked the high-point of this revolutionary rising when, following  years of military occupation, the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico staged an unsuccessful armed insurrection.They paid a heavy price for tweaking the tale of the tiger. Ill-trained and poorly-equipped cadres of nationalists – branded communists by the powers-that-be – were cut down by US National Guard troops. In the town of Jayuya where revolutionaries had seized control, the residents were subjected to a merciless bombardment by ten Thunderbolt fighter planes armed with -lb bombs. It was the only time in history that the United States bombed its own citizens.Within a fortnight, the rebellion had been quashed but not before a failed assassination attempt on President Truman had ensured the tiny island nation’s freedom struggle made headlines around the world. The nationalists paid a heavy price: vengeful prison sentences were meted out to the leaders and activists. One woman, Blanca Canales, served  years of a le sentence for burning the post office in Jayuya — the same town levelled by US planes. Their incarcerated leader Pedro Albizu Campos was subject to brutal conditions right out of the Gulag Archipelago — and then some. In , he was exposed to radiation poisoning which led to visible burns on his extremities, swelling of his face and led to a stroke which left him paralysed. Thus ended the long struggle of the revolutionary who had parlayed with De Valera and raised money for the Irish liberation movement in Boston in  — at one point he spoke in front of , people in Sanders Theatre in Boston and delivered what was described, by an English lord no less who was present, as “the most complete, the most brilliant speech” on Irish freedom ever heard. The  years which followed his death in  were, says Denis, “a downward spiral of chaos and corruption that turned the island into a punch-drunk fighter, unsure of its whereabouts, wobbling on its feet, pawing at empty air”.It’s hard to argue that things have improved of late. Emigration is the only route to meaningful work for an entire generation: In  alone, it lost a net , residents or nearly . per cent of its population. In , the island went bankrupt with the US Government refusing to come to its aid. In , Puerto Rico was hammered by a Hurricane Maria — the worst natural disaster to ever hit the island. “Is there a solution to all this ” asks Denis. “Of course, but the complicated ones rarely work. Those that have been tried include corporate tax subsidies to giant pharmaceutical companies, a fraudulent war on drugs, government subsidies, austerity programmes, and real estate speculation. These ‘solutions’ breed government fraud, police corruption, absentee ownership, junk bonds, media spin, and rampant hotels, shopping malls and parking lots. The answer may be much simpler. It starts with an honest self-appraisal. It acknowledges the eviction of an entire people — literally and systematically — from their own land.”Nelson Denis has done a service to the people of Puerto Rico — his people — and to the wider world watching on with this authoritative history of a brave island people. He has, at last, put Puerto Rico on the map."},{"url":null,"title":"meet the brexitbashing twitter account followed by leo varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

State papers: Claims of shoot-to-kill policy by the RUC at the height of Troubles had ‘grave implications’ for Garda co-operation, said Dublin Justice Minister The two soldiers were surrounded by the crowd when they joined the funeral cortege of Caoimhin Mac Bradaigh, an IRA man killed in Milltown Cemetery by the loyalist Michael Stone while attending the funerals of the three IRA members shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar.The double killings provoked outrage among MPs at Westminster.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\". State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mr Ryan also said people across Britain wrote to their MPs demanding greater action against terrorists.The two plain-clothed British soldiers inadvertently drove into the path of the funeral before mourners pulled them from the car and were beaten before being shot dead by members of the IRA.The murders happened days after the funerals of the three IRA members who were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain Mr Ryan said after meeting backbenchers at Westminster, he was struck by their exasperation and anger \"without any proper sense of how to ventilate it\" while there was a resurgence of \"frustrated patience\" with Ireland.\"The complexity of the issues elude their instinctual approach to policy questions, that of self-interested pragmatism and this further fuels their primary response to events such as last Saturdays,\" he added.

State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"alexa can now help nfl newbies understand the american sport","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I quickly realised it was prevalent in a lot of families.ldquoThankfully, society is beginning to talk about it more. ldquoWe need to continue to talk about it because it is so dficult for anyone living with domestic violence to tell their story and it is extremely dficult for children.ldquoThey are scared to speak out because they remain afraid of what might happen to themthey told an outside organisation. Sometimes, their silence is due to them feeling ashamed or even responsible for the abuse they are dealing with.Sheila understood quite early in le about the effects of trauma. Her elder brother, Eugene, disappeared on New Yearrsquos Day  when Sheila was in her early teens.His three children came to live with her family and she saw how her own mother and father were able to make their lives as normal as possible which led to some healing for all of them.The tragedy was the inspiration behind a play called, The Ferryman which debuted in London recently.ldquoMy role is tough, she explains, ldquobut social workers are our own support network. We meet with a lot of anger and abuse. It can be challenging but it can also be rewarding. Many people do come back to us to say thank you or, they will say to us that wersquove helped to turn their le around. That is said to us more frequently than anything . Thatrsquos what keeps us doing the job. We are the source from which change is possible. Everyone has the potential to change and I see it played out time and time again.It is evident that Sheila is dedicated to the families she protects. She said: ldquoDomestic violence is quite prevalent in Northern Ireland. One in six women and one in nine men will live with it including their children some time in their le.ldquoPolice are called to an incident every  minutes. Curiously, it is this time of year that sees a spike in those figures. Christmas Day and New Yearrsquos Day will see the highest numbers of women and children call the police for help.ldquoAnd, I do think the timing of this MBE from the Queen will only serve to raise awareness of this issue. And might even help someone who is suffering abuse to pick up the phone and ask for help.Sheila advises that anyone who wishes to make a call should contact   , which is completely confidential.

They include the Voisinage Agreement with the Irish Government to allow Co Down fishermen to resume fishing in Irish Sea waters. There is also the need for improvements to harbour infrastructure at Ardglass and Kilkeel to allow larger boats to land fish.Miss Ritchie said the prawn quota reduction was more to do with the species being exempted from so-called discard ban.She added: ldquoIt is vitally important that our local fishing industry in the catching and processing sectors is allowed to continue to grow and develop.ldquoThe Government needs to continue with a positive working relationship with the industry to allow the economic sectors in Ardglass and Kilkeel to be nurtured to ensure existing jobs are sustained and new employment opportunities are realised.Mr Alan McCulla, chief executive of the Anglo-North Irish Fish Producers Organisation Sea Source, believes the outcome of the annual negotiation on catch quotas ldquoputs Northern Irelandrsquos fishermen in a good starting position for the next phase in our relationship with the EU.He said the agreements reached at the Fisheries Council meeting offered ldquosome positives and some negatives for the Irish Sea, with the December negotiations described by the Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairsas ldquoone of the most dficult councils in recent years.A spokesperson for the government department said it was vitally important to ensure that sufficient quota was obtained for all Irish Sea fish species to enable them to land all the fish they catch from the start of the New Year, particularly whiting which is a by-catch in the prawn fishery.ldquoThe EU Commission initially proposed an Irish Sea whiting quota of  tonnes but this was successfully negotiated up by % to  tonnes, with agreement to carry out a further review of the quota in the new year.The government department spokesperson said the deal ldquoensures that there are now workable solutions to alleviate the pressure for fishermen while preventing fish from being wastefully discarded unnecessarily..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan tree voted top in NI  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Parkrsquos giant redwood is celebrating being voted Northern Irelandrsquos Tree of the Year in the Woodland Trustrsquos search for the countryrsquos best-loved tree.The stunning redwood mdash or multi-stemmed giant sequoia to be precise mdash finished second in the  UK final.Everyone associated with the Forest Service, the people of Castlewellan and ious groups helping with ambitious regeneration proposals at the stunning forest park, are delighted with the majestic treersquos success in the regional heat.The giant redwood stands within the walled garden at the forest park and at over  years old has seen centuries come and go.

The Hoops raced into a - first half lead with goals from Stephen Galbraithand Sean McMahon before Jordan McCoubrey delivered the coup de grace in the th minute to finally kill off a game Olympic outfit.Celtic looked the more composed and inventive side from the off and an understrength Olympic struggled to create anything of note. The Hoops seized the lead with only six and a half minutes gone and never looked back.Chris Mullan, who was like a fleet-footed gazelle down the left flank and just missed out on the man of the match award, sped past his marker on the edge of the box.His stinging shot that looked destined for the bottom corner of the net was parried out by an alert Ryan Connollly, but Galbraith was hovering around the six-yard box and was perfectly placed to steer the ball home.Less than two minutes later Mullan dipped his shoulder again and cut inside Jack Roddy before striking the base of the post with a fierce shot.Olympic steadfastly refused to buckle and with  minutes gone were unlucky not to equalise when Aaron McCaffrey, their most potent player in attack, was unable to take advantage in a rare moment of panic in the Celtic box.Celtic went back on the attack and with  minutes gone taskmaster Jordan Curran teamed up with Mullan to create an opening for Sean McMahon, but he fired wide.Back at the other end, the dangerous McCaffrey got in behind Conor Doherty, but his delightfully flighted cross missed by everyone in the box.With  minutes gone Rottweiler Curran blocked an Olympic attempt to send Rhys Patterson clear. The ball flew off his shin and into the path of the willing Sean McMahon who raced away from Michael Rice and Darryl Russell, but with only Connolly to beat, his cheeky, dinked effort grazed the crossbar on the way to safety.A minute later another mazy Mullan run ended with the wing wizard crossing for McMahon, but this seasonrsquos top scorer had his audacious effort blocked on the six yard box with Celtic claiming a penalty.The second goal wasnrsquot long in coming and with  minutes gone a Mullan cross was deftly headed home by Doherty, who had been given the freedom of the box. Three minutes later Galbraith made it - when his low corner evaded Connolly at his near post and ended up in the net.Celtic continued their dominance after the break with Mullan and McMahon dovetailing perfectly for Curran, but his shot went well over the top. With  minutes gone McMahon decided to go it alone, but he was well off target as Olympic backed off him.Olympic tried desperately to get things moving, but it just wasnrsquot their day and with  minutes played Russell did exceptionally well to prevent Galbraith from making it - with a last-gasp tackle.The fourth goal was just around the corner and with  minutes gone Andy Baggley headed the ball into the path of prodigy Jordan McCoubrey, who looked suspiciously offside. The teenage terrier didnrsquot hang around as Olympic had pushed up and he raced cleat to beat Connolly all ends up.If anything, Celtic could have won by an even bigger margin and Connolly saved brilliantly in the th minute to deny Baggley a fth Celtic goal.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Shaun Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Mikey Rice, Jordan Curran, Terence Bell, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan.

state Owen Pattersonwith the DUPs David Simpson and Stephen Moutray outside Dan Winters Cottage in Capita had been engaged by The Ulster Society – in which David Trimble was then involved – using public funding for cross-community initiatives in order to explore whether an Orange interpretive centre at the site of Dan Winter’s cottage in Loughgall was a viable proposal.Mr McCavera wrote to Capita to say that he had placed the proposal before a meeting of the CCMS: “The council responded positively to the proposal and could see no objections to Catholic maintained schools participating in programmes associated with the centre.”However, he stressed that it would be for inidual Catholic schools to decide on whether they wanted to visit the centre, rather than the CCMS instructing them to do so.The Ulster Society had applied for a grant in  for an information and educational facility at the site, with a desire to see the site developed in time for , the Order’s bicentenary anniversary.The proposal was for a building which would become both a tourist attraction and an educational facility.But progress was slow, not least because of a dispute over which cottage was the one in which the Orange had been founded and then, after agreement on the correct location, a dispute with the owner over the terms on which it would be sold.A civil service briefing note on the situation said that “progress in purchasing the cottages and adjoining land has been problematic and the Ulster Society has run into objections from both the Planning Service and Roads Service, DOE. “The main obstacle, however, has been a dispute between two branches of the Winter family over ownership of the land for the proposed site of the Diamond Heritage Centre.”In  Dan Winter’s cottage was listed on both historical and architectural grounds and Capita delivered its report.The document stressed the historic signicance of the Orange Order, a body which it said had grown “into a highly influential organisation with an international network ... indeed, a full appreciation of the cultural heritage of Northern Ireland, and a competent and objective understanding of current affairs requires an appreciation of the nature of Orangeism”.“The story of Orangeism at its birth, and in its later evolution, is of intrinsic interest. As an element of the ‘cultural tradition’ of Northern Ireland and as an ingredient in the quest for ‘mutual understanding’ this story has a more practical purpose.”Margaret Ritchie: If the SDLP name disappears I will severely regret it‘Irish feted first baby of  – but won’t applaud first le terminated’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It admitted that “commercial viability of the centre is not possible” but that there were wider economic and social benefits to such a project.The project was to involve refurbishment of the two cottages and the construction of an interpretive building which would house a shop, cafe, toilets, a display space and a video theatre.There would also be car parking, a children’s play area and a model farm and orchard.The consultants concluded that “there exists a potential market for the facility” but that it would cost about £, and would require between , and , visitors a year “to achieve its financial, economic and social impact objectives”.In the end, the project did not go ahead for reasons which are not clear from the file. It was not until  that, thanks to a £, EU and Stormont grant, work began to turn the cottage into a tourist attraction.In , the Order received almost £ million from EU, Stormont and Irish government funding to build museums of Orange heritage at its Schomberg House headquarters in east Belfast and at Sloan’s House in Loughgall.try catch            ..

A referendum in May gave overwhelming support for the measure by .% to .%.As a result, Dublin now provides abortions up to week  of pregnancy, or where there is serious risk to the mother, or where the baby is likely to die shortly after birth.Despite a spate of recent legal challenges, an abortion is currently only lawful in NI where the pregnancy seriously risks a woman’s health.Ms McAvoy said: “On January , the Republic of Ireland celebrated the first baby to be born in . That same day the country’s new legislation on abortion came in to effect. The first human le to be terminated will probably not be celebrated publicly at least.”She added: “We would urge our politicians [in NI] to resist the lobbying from abortion activists and instead provide a more hopeful future for women facing pregnancy crises, a future which is inclusive of them and their children.” Nola Leach, chief executive of the charity Christian Action Research and Education, said the Republic’s new law provides little practical support for women.“It only contains the ‘quick-fix’ of an abortion with little mention of extra funding for support services, counselling, or better provision of information, fostering and adoption for mothers,” she said.There are , people in NI today, she said, who would not be alive had GB legislation been extended here a recent Comres poll found % of people in NI agreed that “both lives matter” in a pregnancy, she added.But Grainne Teggart of Amnesty said the new law and commencement of abortion services are “signicant milestones” in a country which had “one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world”. Amnesty welcomes the fact that women from NI can now access abortion services in the south, she said. However, this serves to underscore “the absurdity of the position women here now find themselves in” because they can board a train or plane for abortions in Dublin or GB but cannot access the same service in NI. “We call on the secretary of state and UK government to ensure  is the year change happens,” she added. with the DUPs David Simpson and Stephen Moutray outside Dan Winters Cottage in \"   with the DUPs David Simpson and Stephen Moutray outside Dan Winters Cottage in \"  Declassied files: CCMS said in  it wasn’t against Catholic schools making Orange Order visitsPSNI deal with multiple cases of blackmail involving men coaxed into performing sex acts Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Alliance for Choice activist, Goretti Horgan, said the vast majority of southern abortions will be through pills prescribed by GPs – medication which she said women on both sides of the border have been using for over a decade.“The change in the south is unlikely to help women here very much,” she said. “We can access abortions in the Republic but would have to pay.” In addition, the three-day ‘cooling off period’ now required to access abortion in the south means an NI woman would have to travel south twice in a week for pills that she could order online in NI without leaving her house.Ex-Sinn Fein TD Pedar Tobin, who is hoping to set up an all-Ireland pro-le political party, lamented the south’s new abortion services.“Leo Varadkar stated this week that the introduction of one of the most extreme abortion regimes in Europe was a sign of social progress,” he told the News Letter. “It shows how upside down our world has become that when the state seeks to end the lives of thousands of inidual human beings it is considered progress.”The majority of women who seek abortions “do so for socio-economic reasons” yet nobody addressed this during the referendum debate, he said. “Shockingly, FF, SF and the SDLP are in lockstep in the promotion of abortion services across Ireland north and south,” he added. Sinn Fein MLA Megan Fearon said: “Sinn Fein supports access to quality and safe abortion care for all women on the island of Ireland.”try catch            ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

Initially under the baton of Clford Bunford and later conducted by Douglas Baxter, the choir performed many of the major works of the choral repertoire and several less well known works. Following Douglas retirement in , the choir began to suffer a decline in numbers, which led to a ersying of the repertoire.The choir was rebranded as Barry Community Choir in  and, under the leadership of conductor, Emma Arscott, the membership has begun to increase again.The choir meets in Crossway Church in Barry on Wednesday evenings and all are welcome to join.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

However, I do prefer to buy and shop from local family businesses.And for all those curious about Veganuary, are taking part for the first time or are interested in finding out more, Ms Thomas will be holding a VeganJanuary fair in Penarthrsquos Paget Rooms on Sunday, January  from pm to pm.There will be a iety of stalls including Melrsquos Kindness Kitchen Vegan Cheeses, Lottiersquos Vegan Bakery and more.For more information, search Absolutely Fabulous Vegan Fayres on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34453454454.jpg","title":"supporting belfast start ups on the rise","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business The UK’s digital tech sector has attracted more capital than any other European country and Belfast has established itself as a key hub, writes Roisin Byrne, business director, Hays Northern Ireland The  Tech Nation report makes it clear that digital tech makes an essential contribution to our local economy with clusters and start-ups forming primarily around AI , machine learning, cyber security and big data industries. The Belfast start-up community ecosystem is alive and well and has carved out a reputation in the wider tech community for having good access to talent, funding and transport links. It also benefits from great workspaces such as Ormeau Baths, Farset Labs and the Innovation Centre at Catalyst Inc. Indeed, the city is bubbling with entrepreneurial talent as demonstrated by the large number of start-ups which have launched in the last two years. Belfast boasts a disproportionate number of the UK’s high growth firms and it is estimated that the local ecosystem now supports around , jobs. Hays has worked with a number of these start-ups as they have scaled up operations – firms such as Analytics Engines, Uleska and Vox to name a few. As part of our commitment to the sector we’ve also taken space in Ormeau Baths which has become an epicentre for tech meet-ups, hackathons and pitch events. It’s also a campus for early stage and growth stage start-ups to network, share experience and build scalable, globally focussed businesses. In its first year, % of companies based in Ormeau Baths grew their teams and revenues, and raised over £m in venture funding. We’ve also launched a new national initiative called Super Connect delivered by Empact Ventures which aims to help tech start-ups and scale-ups to explore collaboration with large organisations and funding providers through a series of venture labs and pitch days. The initiative brings together corporates, SMEs, angel investors, venture capitalists, grant providers, loan funds and crowdfunding s to explore supporting these start-ups and scale-ups. Details can be found at www.superconnectseries. In an increasingly competitive marketplace Hays sees real value in the innovative ideas start-ups are using to network and build traction and as they scale up to the next stage we are providing material support and employer value branding to help them attract the talent they need.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
