In retrospect, the nightmare agony of my 17 years with Vivienne seems to me preferable to the dull misery of the mediocre teacher of philosophy which would have been the alternative.\u0027         More than a thousand letters released by Princeton University in New Jersey provide an extraordinary insight into the troubled love life of the writerThat awful marriage, he says, \u0027brought the state of mind out of which came The Waste Land\u0027.In the letter, Eliot also provides new insight into the other momentous decision in his life — to defy his wealthy Boston family and live his life in England after Oxford. He describes a \u0027life-changing\u0027 meeting in 1914 with the expat U.S. poet Ezra Pound, who encouraged him to stay in England.Eliot said all he wanted of Vivienne was \u0027a flirtation or a mild affair\u0027 but that he was \u0027too shy and unpractised to achieve either with anybody\u0027. He \u0027persuaded\u0027 himself he loved her simply so he could commit himself to staying in England. She in turn persuaded herself she would \u0027save the poet\u0027 by keeping him there.Later, Eliot accepted a one-year poetry professorship at Harvard in 1932 and exploited the fact that his wife couldn\u0027t accompany him. He saw Miss Hale in California, where she was teaching, and saw her \u0027from time to time\u0027 every summer in later years when she came to stay with family in the Cotswolds.He says he only realised he didn\u0027t love her when his wife died in 1947. \u0027Gradually I came to see that I had been in love only with a memory, with the memory of the experience of having been in love with her in my youth,\u0027 he writes.He started to see how little they had in common. He writes witheringly that he not only knew she wasn\u0027t interested in his poetry but that she was also guilty of \u0027insensitiveness and bad taste\u0027.One of her most serious failings, apart from her lack of respect for his strong views on religion and orce, appears to be that she cared more for the opinion of a \u0027woolly-minded\u0027 uncle than she did for his. \u0027It may be too harsh, to think that what she liked was my reputation rather than my work,\u0027 he adds.         Pictured: Emily Hale and T.S. Eliot pose in a 1946 photo in Dorset, VermontT.S. Eliot expert Craig Raine said Eliot\u0027s \u0027devastating letter\u0027 to the executors was a qualification of his love letters to Hale. \u0027Take them with a sackful of salt, is what he is saying,\u0027 he explains.Eliot\u0027s unhappiness with both these two central women in his life contrasted deeply with the happiness he found with his second wife, Valerie, the second Mrs Eliot, who married him in 1957 and died only in 2012.After hearing his poem The Journey Of The Magi as a schoolgirl, she became obsessed by Eliot and reportedly told her headmaster that her ambition in life was to become the poet\u0027s secretary.She joined the typing pool at his publisher, Faber, and did become his secretary, eventually earning the literary hero\u0027s gratitude. \u0027It is only within the last few years that I have known what it was to love a woman who truly, selflessly and wholeheartedly loves me,\u0027 he writes. \u0027I find it hard to believe that the equal of Valerie ever has been or will be again.\u0027Eliot\u0027s troubled relationships with women prompted at least one biographer to conclude he was homosexual. Although he took a vow of chastity in 1928, aged 40, some experts believe it wasn\u0027t until he married his second wife when he was 68 (she was 30) that he was really introduced to sex.They made an odd couple, the etiolated Eliot fawning over his big-chested blonde wife at literary parties. So in love was he that he wrote in one poem, A Dedication To My Wife, of \u0027lovers whose bodies smell of each other\u0027.After he died, Valerie fiercely guarded his legacy, although she published some of his letters. But this cache of 1,131 letters to Emily Hale — in which he pours out his heart — shine a pitiless light on his brilliant mind.In one letter he tells Hale \u0027my love is as pure and unseeking as any love can be\u0027 and that \u0027loving and adoring you has given me the very best that I have had in my life\u0027.Eliot was 24 and Hale 21 when they met. A beautiful aspiring actress with a lovely singing voice, she writes that before the awkward Eliot left America for Oxford, \u0027to my great surprise, he told me how very much he cared for me\u0027.In a letter from 1931, by which time they had reconnected, Eliot blames himself for their failure to click and says \u0027when I first knew you I was immature for my age, timid and intensely egotistical\u0027.Ten months after the death of his first wife, he wrote to her: \u0027It is always you or nobody.\u0027He would address her in his letters as \u0027My Saint\u0027, \u0027My Emily my dear\u0027 and \u0027My Lady Emily\u0027 and signs off \u0027yours devotedly\u0027.His devotion, however, clearly withered when he learned that she was making it available for public consumption. "},{"url":null,"title":"Harry Meghan helped pictures couple hike Vancouver Abigail Spencer","story":"Share this article Once she realized it was the Duchess taking the picture Kantorowicz said: \u0027In that moment the only thing I could think to say, There\u0027s only so much that selfie sticks can do.\u0027She laughed and responded with something like, We\u0027ll have to do better, and then Harry said, No pressure. Both couples are then said to have wished each a happy new year.   DailyMail.com exclusively revealed Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, spent their first Christmas with baby Archie in a $14.1 million waterfront mansion on Vancouver Island. They were joined by the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s mother Doria Ragland. Locals in the island’s rural community of North Saanich noticed cameras and fences erected at the property as early as December 19, before the mansion was swarmed with security guards.                  The royal couple are spending time with the Duchess\u0027s Suits co-star Abigail Spencer.

The new “chuna” mayo baguette (with chick peas replacing tuna), VLT (with roasted shiitake mushroom “rashers” in place of bacon), eggless mayo baguette and hoisin mushroom wrap went on sale initially in its five standalone Veggie Pret shops. However, if they prove very popular with customers, they will be rolled out to the main chain too.In a further fillip for customers seeking plant-based options, Pret will announce that from next Tuesday, it is dropping its charge for dairy milk alternatives: with barista-prepared hot and cold drinks, oat and rice-coconut milk will be offered free alongside soya milk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d86002797af545d0841916848f5330b1edfedcd/75_18_2137_1282/master/2137.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfb6e1775a7ad1d6b00d0b9d39141c34","title":"authoritarian leaders people safe voters","story":"With every new year, I typically set aside some time to write down what I’m grateful for. Health, family, friends, books, jazz, my dog, among other things. This year I added something I’ve been taking for granted. It’s democracy.Like many of us, I have worried about the rising tide of rightwing populism, nationalism and polarisation across the world. Within just a few years, we’ve witnessed the election of Donald Trump in the US, the Brexit decision in the UK, the rise of Matteo Salvini in Italy, Victor Orbán in Hungary, the Freedom party in Austria and the Law and Justice party in Poland. The world’s largest democracy, India, is menaced by a newly virulent nationalism and xenophobia.For a long time I wondered what explained the appeal of these apparently fringe movements that, in my view, had accidentally gone mainstream. They seemed like the exception to a general rule of progression towards, not away from, democratic norms. But this year I came to a different conclusion: it’s democracy that is a precious exception to the rule, and one that is extremely fragile, for a simple reason: the human craving for order and security when chaos feels imminent.The philosopher and psychologist Erich Fromm first identified this predicament in his 1941 book, Escape from Freedom. The gist of it is this: when people perceive an increase in disorder, they feel tremendous anxiety. Inevitably, this anxiety leads to a quest for security. To bring a sense of safety back into their lives, they latch on to authoritarianism and conformity. As Fromm noted, this often leads to “a readiness to accept any ideology and any leader if only he offers a political structure and symbols which allegedly give meaning and order to an inidual’s life”. He had observed this in Germany, which he fled in 1933: “Modern man still is anxious and tempted to surrender his freedom to dictators of all kinds,” he wrote.Fromm was speculating about this dynamic. But decades later, I and other psychologists have empirically shown how insecurity is linked to the rise of autocrats and the erosion of democracy. In a survey we conducted before the 2016 US presidential election, for example, we asked US residents questions about how fearful they were about various threats, such as illegal immigration, a lack of jobs, crime, terrorism, an attack from Iran, among others. They also responded to statements aimed at gauging their desire for stricter rules and their support for different political candidates, including Trump. We conducted the same survey in 2017 in France, measuring support for Marine Le Pen.The results of both studies were telling: people who felt threatened wanted to tighten up – to have stricter rules – which predicted their support for Trump or Le Pen in the US and France, respectively. Other research confirms the same pattern. Economic threats and the growing gap between the rich and poor also create a sense of chaos and instability. This has led to increased support for strong leaders willing to challenge democratic values and practices.It’s a simple principle, one that is causing democracies all around the world to unravel. When people experience threat – whether actual or imagined – they begin to “tighten”. In physical terms, they tense their muscles, ready to defend themselves. In political terms, they begin to crave security and order in a community that seems to be collapsing. Authoritarian leaders satiate this need by promising quick, simple solutions – and, above all, a return to the tighter social order of yesteryear.Leaders are aware of this basic psychology and exaggerate threats to gain popularity. Trump did so masterfully: at campaign rallies throughout 2015 and 2016, he warned his ever-growing crowds that the US was a nation on the “brink of disaster”. He cited Mexicans supposedly bringing violence across the border, global trade agreements and immigrants taking away jobs, and radicalised Muslims plotting terror on American soil. Throughout his campaign, he sent the clear message that he was capable of restoring social order: “I alone can fix it.” Analysing campaign speeches, we found that Trump used far more threatening language than Hillary Clinton.To strengthen democracy, we’re going to have to deal with this threat psychology. Some of the threats, such as the loss of well-paid, secure employment, are real. We need to empathise with those who are struggling – rather than dismissing their fears – and develop innovative solutions, particularly for those put out of work by the decline of manufacturing amid the AI revolution.Now more than ever, we need to develop ways to counter the misperceptions that are beginning to upend democracies. We can’t take those fragile political arrangements for granted. It is not primarily a question of weeding out particular personalities or reversing regrettable decisions, but addressing the things that made them attractive in the first place: that pervasive sense of rising threat.• Michele Gelfand is a distinguished professor of psychology at the University of Maryland and the author of Rule Makers, Rule Breakers: How Tight and Loose Cultures Wire Our World"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/110a530adca530cfe30a49df48fe0e012a36bb0e/0_37_1777_1066/master/1777.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9f609e0b75387fe06c2a886c68975ed","title":"the guardian view on civil service reform a cummings plan","story":"Britain’s civil service is often depicted, in fact and in fiction, as an unchanging monolith. Yet for decades Whitehall has been an arena of repeated and often radical change. Governments of different colours – the Conservatives in 1951 and 1979, Labour in 1964 and 1997 – have come into office suspicious of what they saw as a kind of permanent Whitehall machine, dedicated to maintaining a continuity in policy which politicians are powerless to overthrow. Now, as a result of the 2019 election, Britain has another such government.Boris Johnson’s government will soon unveil its own plans for public sector reform. In an article on Thursday, the influential Conservative policy adviser Rachel Wolf makes clear that these are not intended to be cosmetic. Instead, Ms Wolf argues that changing Whitehall will be a major and radical focus of the Johnson era. Too much of the early discussion about the possible changes, she warns, has focused on a departmental reshuffle, with the Brexit department closed down, and changes affecting the Home Office, justice and international development.Important though such changes could be, Ms Wolf sees them as only a fraction of the larger plan crafted by the prime minister’s chief aide, Dominic Cummings. She thinks officials are “woefully unprepared for what is coming”. This larger plan, of which futuristic inklings can be gleaned from Mr Cummings’s personal blog, is focused on modernisation, systems and delivery. Some of its elements could include recruiting more science and technology graduates, making existing civil servants pass exams in data science and systems, and ensuring that officials stay in departments for longer than the current tendency to move on after 18 months.It would be easy, and to an extent understandable, to react to this radicalism with exasperation. After all, civil service numbers have been cut by a fifth since 2010. For some years, the 18-month merry-go-round between jobs has been one of the few ways to get a pay rise. And while some of the things that Mr Cummings wants to see on data, teams and openness are already established good practice, it is a huge ask to expect such a stretched system to deliver efficiently without substantial new investment.Yet it would be wrong to write off the government’s plans. First, they have not yet even seen the light of day. They should be read first, then discussed. Second, it is undeniable that the British state could do much better at delivering projects and systems on time, on budget and in a manner that puts the citizen first. Cost overruns, delayed implementation, poor productivity and inefficient delivery systems are not fake news. They are familiar realities. And, third, if the pressures for promotion, among ministers and among civil servants, are not restrained in a sensible way, then the long-term policymaking consequences for society are likely to be harmful.The Johnson government is entitled to confront these issues. It has promised more GP appointments, train lines and police officers. It is reasonable for it to ensure, as far as possible, that these pledges are fulfilled. In the now very distant event of a Labour government, the same would apply. That does not mean that the government must get a blank cheque. Some of Mr Cummings’ ideas are naively technophile. Others betray a starry-eyed faith in Silicon Valley management theory. The love of disruption responds to a genuine problem of inertia with what could become a destructive fetish. Yet Britain is right to expect a state sector that offers the public a good deal. That requires proper levels of spending. But it requires a lot of other things too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3042e1418077946fe69eb60671bb076a1a538da3/0_228_3848_2309/master/3848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dabfa1bc2003752dd1bcbc4592be6a65","title":"green suits nature prints bring hope for fashion industry","story":"Experts predict green will be the colour of the decade, but industry’s eco awareness is still laggingThere’s nothing new about fashion using nature as its muse – see Miranda Priestley’s withering put-down in The Devil Wears Prada: “Florals for Spring? Groundbreaking.” This year, however, it’s not flowers but foliage that will have a major fashion moment.At the springsummer 2020 collections several major brands have taken leaves and plants as their inspiration.At Christopher Kane, jackets and skirts were printed with a magnified photograph of wildflowers and blades of grass. At Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana, dresses were printed with palm tree fronds and models wore tropical flower-inspired shoes and headgear. At Versace, Jennifer Lopez’s catwalk appearance in a copy of the jungle print dress she first wore in 2000 sent the internet into meltdown. And in menswear, Dries Van Noten showed suits covered in green flowers and creepers, while at Valentino there were palm leaf prints and camouflage.Green was a dominant colour, whether used head-to-toe (as in the first seven looks from the emerging design star Christopher John Rogers) or as collection showstoppers. Victoria Beckham showed floor-length, frilled apple green frocks Gucci had fuzzy chartreuse jumpers that recalled artificial grass, and teal and pistachio suits. The LGD – little green dress – stood out, like the stroke of a highlighter pen, at Regina Pyo, Marc Jacobs, Balenciaga and Valentino.In a recent presentation looking even further ahead to springsummer 2021, the Dutch trend forecaster Li Edelkoort predicted that green would be a key colour for the rest of the decade. She linked its popularity to a hunger for nature, seen also in the renewed trend for houseplants and the rise of the Japanese practice of meditation in woods or “forest bathing”.Green’s popularity has been building for some time. Pantone named Greenery its colour of the year in 2017, and many of 2019’s stand-out fashion moments were green: in August, Phoebe Waller-Bridge made best-dressed lists in a forest green suit singer Billie Eilish launched a childrenswear collection the same retina-searing lime as her trademark dyed parting and this same bright green was worn by Lizzo and Lil Nas X on the red carpet and used for the most Instagrammed book cover of the year, Margaret Atwood’s The Testaments.Green is also a colour that signifies renewal Atwood chose it, she said, for its hopeful connotations. Still, the trend highlights the disconnect between fashion’s reliance on nature – for inspiration and materials – and the damage caused by its current business model. No designers said they had intended to explore the climate crisis with their plant-inspired collections, nor did they provide information about their environmental impact.Such contradictions were discussed during sustainability panels at London fashion week, where model and environmentalist Arizona Muse talked about her own recent reconnection with nature. “I became accustomed to not seeing nature,” she said, “to seeing sidewalks and cars. Now, just by paying attention to it, I see inidual leaves, I see trunks, I see insects on plants, all these things are becoming alive to me.”An optimistic reading of the trend would be to say that – subconsciously at least – the process of reconnection has at least begun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fe80a95abb976273d44975253b80b706864c594/2_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2db1a323700d265aaab4105c0ec9f071","title":"all federico fellinis films ranked","story":"To celebrate the centenary of the birth of the great Italian director, here’s a cavalcade of his extraordinary feature filmsA gentle, episodic Fellini, with Roberto Benigni playing Ivo, a madcap character who travels far and wide across the Italian landscape on a romantic, fantastical quest to capture the moon.This reunited two of Fellini’s great collaborators: his wife and great love Giulietta Masina and Marcello Mastroianni playing two cheesy old hoofers who do a Fred’n’Ginger tribute routine.A fantasy-fictional version of a documentary, as Fellini grants an interview to a Japanese camera crew and takes them round Cinecittà studios and the contents of his own mind and memories.Some quaint softcore sensuality, perhaps, in this study of a man (Mastroianni) who, Dante-like, wakes up in the middle of his life and finds himself in a hotel in the middle of the woods that is overrun with desirable women.A movie with Fellini’s signature surrealism and episodic structure: a fever dream of imperial Rome, taken from Petronius.Fellini’s debut movie, co-directed with Albert Lattuada, and with a real taste of the exuberance and theatricality still to come. A beautiful young woman joins a travelling troupe of entertainers. Masina has a tiny role as the girlfriend of one of the vaudevillians.Donald Sutherland is Casanova who, in keeping with Fellini’s habitual wayward episodic anarchy and surrealism, is shown not really as a great lover, but an absurd and comic figure at the mercy of fate and his urges.An interesting, atypical, underrated Fellini film – perhaps closer to Miloš Forman – a political satire about an orchestra that goes on strike.A docu-fiction about Fellini’s fascination and passion for circus clowns. It features – as a dwarf nun – Adelina Poerio, who went on to play the red-clad killer in Don’t Look Now.This was Fellini’s first solo directing credit: a joyful romantic comedy that stars the veteran Roman actor Alberto Sordi as a bridegroom whose wife goes missing. It was remade by Woody Allen as one of the sections in his 2012 film To Rome With Love.This film , like La Strada, is a midway point between the neorealism of Fellini’s early screenwriting career and the humour and picaresque pathos of his later work. Broderick Crawford, Richard Basehart and Masina star in a story about a team of confidence tricksters roaming the countryside tricking farmers out of their savings. Crawford plays Augusto, the leader of the gang, who is coming to tire of this life. His personal confusion is brought to a crisis when his daughter re-enters his life.An intensely personal, exuberant and extravagant film that is at once a fantastical autobiography and a kind of episodic, biographical portrait of the film’s leading character: Rome itself, which is presented in a series of semi-connected episodes of its past and present. Roma is also notable for featuring a swansong appearance for the legendary Roman star Anna Magnani. As so often, the movie transforms material that would otherwise be merely autobiographical: a heightened, hallucinatory version of Fellini takes us on a journey into the city, beginning with a spectacular shot of a traffic jam.This was Fellini’s first full-length colour film, and it is a classic of fantasy, theatricality and sensuality. Masina stars as Juliet, an unhappily married woman with a philandering husband, who conceives a preoccupation with the life of her super-sexy and buxom neighbour Suzy, played by the actor Sandra Milo (who played the director’s mistress in 8 ½). Suzy seems to live a guilt- and risk-free life of sexual pleasure in a house tricked out for gratification, and she appears to be inviting Juliet to join her in this attitude. A complex, unhappy film, said to be inspired by a difficult patch in Masina’s relationship with Fellini.Another surreal gem from Fellini: a movie whose love of its own artificiality is obvious. It’s a hothouse flower of a film, created in the studio, not the streets – about as far from neorealism as you can get. A group of musical notables are on a cruise-ship journey to scatter the ashes of a famous opera singer – and Fellini serves up a chocolate box of bizarre and hilarious moments and scenes as these various conductors, soloists and sopranos bicker, intrigue and fall out. But the setting is July 1914, after the Archduke Franz Ferdinand assassination, with war on the horizon, and the tension is ratcheted up when a group of Serbian refugees are accepted on to the ship.Fellini’s genius for welding memory, dream and waking consciousness is on show in this classic movie, whose title is a slang phrase for “I remember”. It’s a personal, quasi-autobiographical tale of a little boy growing up near Rimini, the place of Fellini’s own boyhood, in an Italy dominated by fascism and the Catholic church. As ever, the spirit and aesthetics of the circus are present: scenes and ideas and images will exuberantly follow each other for our delectation like circus acts being brought into the ring.One of Fellini’s truly great films, with a fierce note of melancholy and even tragedy that is perhaps atypical of him. Masina plays Cabiria, a sex worker whose paradoxical mixture of vulnerability and defiant strength is rendered in a series of episodes. She lives in a wretched shack on the outskirts of town: the eerie modernised wasteland that captured the imagination of both Fellini and Michelangelo Antonioni. Cabiria leads an existence that is almost feral, but at any moment she could find herself in a rich man’s apartment or on a squalid street, and she rises above it all.Fellini’s I Vitelloni (“The Young Bucks”) is an explosion of energy, vitality and warmth: a crowd of restless young men (each with a dash of Fellini himself), led by the rising comedy star Alberto Sordi, dream of escaping their provincial hometown while remaining fiercely loyal to it. Quite a lot of the time, they do nothing and there is not much to do: they grow moustaches, then shave them off. They chase after women and then feel themselves being chased – evading the responsibilities of fatherhood – and, of course, there is the key Fellini carnival moment.The heart-wrenching operatic pathos of this early Fellini masterpiece will blow you away, no matter how many times you see it. Masini gives a Chaplinesque performance as the simple working-class girl, with what would now be called learning difficulties, who is sold by her family for 10,000 lire to a brutish travelling player called Zampanò, played by Anthony Quinn. He bullies and exploits her but realises too late that her presence in his life was the working of a mysterious ine grace. It is a rare moment in Fellini when he goes behind the scenes of circus theatricality and shows us that it is not simply a gorgeously surreal phenomenon, but a tough business that involves heartbreak for its practitioners.There is pure euphoria and inspiration in this magnificent film that satirises the fashionable world of Swinging Rome in the early 1960s. Fellini’s cinema put Italy at the centre of the world in the way that the Beatles would put Britain there a few years later. Mastroianni is the jaded gossip journalist who hangs around the Via Veneto parasitically hoping for showbusiness stories and despising himself for not having written his novel yet. He falls briefly in love with a visiting American star, played by Anita Ekberg, the pair disporting themselves in the Trevi fountain, and submits to a beating from her enraged husband. Later, he will report on a sighting of the Virgin Mary by two children the sacred and profane are of equal importance here.Fellini’s masterpiece starts with cinema’s greatest and most disturbing dream sequence, all the more disquieting for being woven into a film in which dreams and fantasies are being manufactured as a way of escaping dreary reality. Mastroianni plays a film director, Guido Anselmi, who is evidently based on Fellini himself and clearly being created as a kind of therapeutic self-invention or self-mythologising. Guido has reached a moment of personal and creative crisis: he is blocked and production on his latest film has stalled. He embarks on a personal voyage into memory and the past, and a reckoning with all the women he has loved.• The BFI is celebrating Fellini’s centenary with a series of screenings in London and on tour from 3 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0024b5bdaad452d0c801a20f90f8c02ad283efe/0_132_4990_2994/master/4990.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45bd1396bdca705ea581f875d2cf2383","title":"lust in translation how we fell for the people giving arthouse auteurs a voice","story":"When Bong Joon-ho went on the Jimmy Fallon show, the Parasite director’s interpreter made viewers swoon – casting a light on the people who speak English for the likes of Michael Haneke and Park Chan-wookJust when you thought Bong Joon-ho – the affable maestro of Korean cinema and now, with his class-conscious Cannes winner Parasite, champion of the people – could not get any more lovable, they let him on Jimmy Fallon. Foreign-language arthouse directors rarely, if ever, make it on to US talkshows this was apparently the first ever Tonight Show interview conducted through an interpreter. With the director cheekily refusing to play ball at points, including breaking down what the film was actually about (“This is a talkshow – you have to say something!” Fallon chided him), the limelight improbably fell on the woman next to him: Sharon Choi.Choi – a 25-year-old Korean-American, also a film-maker, currently living in Seoul – has only been working with Bong since May, when her skills made her an indispensable part of his team at Cannes. But her scene-stealing has shone a light on interpreting, an overlooked aspect of film’s promotional circuit, especially on the arthouse side. It is a high-grade post, combining two-way linguistic expertise, formidable memory skills (good for keeping hold of rambling directorial musings) and a head for PR. Ever-present, as Choi has been as Parasite does the rounds, interpreters sometimes become a mouthpiece for certain directors. The fresh-faced young man that Takeshi Kitano had on hand during junkets in the early 00s was very conspicuous amid the retinue of yakuza-like goons who would hang around the director during his interviews.Chief responsibility is conveying the precise nuances of what a director wants to communicate about their precious latest work. In that respect, there is surely no more intimidating a client than Michael Haneke. King’s College academic Martin Brady has been his go-to man for years. He has obviously cornered the market in Austrian miserabilists he works for Ulrich Seidl, too. Not only does Brady manage sparkling English-language renderings of Haneke’s icy existential pensée, but reportedly he also delivers his translations in a light Austrian accent.Perhaps the gleaming C3PO of cinema interpreters is the Iranian-born, French-based Massoumeh Lahidji, who spent 12 years as a Cannes in-house translator. A self-described “smuggler, or a midwife, helping things to happen”, she works in Farsi, English, French and Spanish – translating for the likes of Pedro Almodóvar, Asghar Farhadi, Martin Scorsese and Werner Herzog. At an Alfonso Cuarón masterclass at last year’s Lumière in Lyon, the festival director Thierry Frémaux gave her a billing almost on a par with the director himself. Lahidji, who came to Paris in 1982 after escaping revolutionary Iran through the Kurdistan mountains, fell into translation after a chance meeting with Abbas Kiarostami at her first Cannes festival. She accompanied him at festivals for the next nine years, subtitled his films and translated the script for 2010’s Certified Copy. She is especially renowned for conducting live translations without taking notes. “A notebook would only get in the way,” she told Le Monde this year. “I prefer to watch a face, the energy a person gives off. I’m custodian of it for a brief instant, then I give it back to the public.”She calls it the “art of the ephemeral”, but interpreting is also political: helping to level the playing field in cinema. “In a jury, when you have a male American film director, he speaks English and of course he feels much more in power than an actress who’s not comfortable speaking English,” she told AP. Translation is an act of democratisation in a milieu increasingly dominated by English – and it is the reason Bong got to go on Fallon in the first place, something not lost on Sharon Choi’s Twitter stans.• Parasite is released in the UK on 7 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d102c49a7b142cd4d3909f7b8cc04d8b66093db/0_156_1884_1129/master/1884.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35c1420d051d4748b11646ede79a7b08","title":"the most exciting movies of 2020 biopics","story":"Jennifer Hudson plays the queen of soul, Ethan Hawke tackles Tesla and Julianne Moore tells the story of Gloria SteinemHaving wiped away her Catstoddler snot, Jennifer Hudson gives her pipes a wider airing in this Aretha Franklin biopic which – unlike other movies featuring the great lady – Franklin was happy to be involved with.

Tammy Faye (her marriages meant multiple surnames) was a singer, author, talk show host and TV personality who, with then husband Bakker, hosted a small screen puppet show, promoted Christian worship on TV and taped hymn-based albums. The pair also built Heritage USA, a Christian theme park, but this was shut after Bakker was imprisoned in 1989 after being convicted of fraud and conspiracy.A new direction for Johnny Depp as he plays war photographer W Eugene Smith in this movie based on his book documenting the devastating effects of mercury poisoning in Japanese coastal communities.

We can’t discount the impact these subconscious images have on hiring decisions. People tend to hire others who look like they do.”“Celluloid Ceiling” comes on the eve of awards season, and amid growing concerns Hollywood award committees will not continue the upward trend of recognizing women in film this year.The Hollywood Foreign Press Association faced backlash when its nominations in the best director category did not include any women directors, in a year replete with strong contenders such as Greta Gerwig (Little Women), Lulu Wang (The Farewell), and Olivia Wilde (Booksmart). “We don’t vote by gender. We vote by film and accomplishment,” Lorenzo Soria, the president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, told Variety when pressed about the absence of women directors.Prominent female actors are leading the charge in changing the status-quo. As part of the Time Up’s campaign, launched in 2017, Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Lopez, Tessa Thompson and others made public pledges to work with women directors. Since then, Kidman has starred in over five films directed by women and Lopez starred in the critically-acclaimed stripper drama, Hustlers, directed by Lorene Scarfia.But Lauzen cautions that this year’s “Celluloid Ceilings” findings show it’s crucial not to become distracted by marquee female-led films and directors and assume the battle for gender parity is won.“It’s easy to think things have improved dramatically when we see high-profile women such as Patty Jenkins and Marielle Heller directing films or when we hear that women are set to direct five superhero studio features in 2020,” Lauzen says. “A few high-profile cases can dramatically skew our perceptions of how women are faring. That’s why it’s so important to count the numbers of women working, so that we’re not acting on perceptions but on reality.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bdc27f295721704d9c510feb46a060395481539/0_223_6720_4035/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86266709f7fca6506abf0e26ddfca9d0","title":"fast food outlets launch new vegan options for veganuary","story":"KFC and Greggs among chains selling meat-free options to quarter of a million Britons set to embrace VeganuaryForget food storage boxes with leftover nut roast and bean curries, the quarter of a million Britons set to ditch animal products for Veganuary this month are unlikely to be stuck for on-the-go options.On the first working day of 2020 several food retailers started selling new meat-free options, including KFC, which launched its first vegan burger nationwide. Greggs, the UK’s largest bakery chain, also launched a meat-free version of its popular steakbake following the exceptional success of its meatless sausage roll last year.McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, Subway and Costa similarly unveiled new meat-substitute items on their menus, while supermarkets including Aldi and M\u0026ampS ramped up their takeaway vegan efforts with everything from fishless “Tuno” sandwiches to fake smoked chicken wraps.Among the consumers eager to sample some of the latest meat-free fast offerings on Thursday lunchtime were Liadhan O’Ryan, 28, and James Chambers, 29, who had headed to the Deansgate branch of KFC in Manchester specifically to grab a couple of its new quorn-fillet burgers.Chambers, a musician and lecturer who has been vegetarian for five years, admitted the £3.99 burger, with an original-recipe KFC coating and vegan mayo, was unlikely to fool diehard meat-eaters. “You can tell it’s vegetarian, but it is nice,” he said.“Sustainability, veganism and that sort of thing is often seen as quite a middle-class problem, and that’s something I’m aware of,” said O’Ryan.Charlotte Luff, 26, who was picking up her first Veganuary lunch after popping out from the travel agents where she works around the corner, agreed with O’Ryan. “A lot of people are under the impression that vegan options are expensive in general, so that’s why stuff like KFC and Greggs options are so popular,” she said.Other diners were unsure about the burger’s taste. “It’s reasonably harmless, but the flavouring’s not as prominent as the chicken would be,” said Alex White, 49, as he tucked in.After his 15-year-old son decided to become vegetarian as a new year resolution because of the climate crisis, White’s family had decided to reduce their overall meat intake.Although the manager at the store said the new addition was “flying”, White doubted he’d be back for more – “I’d prefer a bean burger like the one at McDonald’s,” he said.A few doors down on Deansgate, customers at Greggs seemed to be more sold on the new £1.55 vegan steakbake – with the store’s batch of 48 all snapped up shortly after 1pm.Laura Cobham, a 20-year-old fashion student at the University of Salford, was delighted with the latest offering, having turned vegan four years ago for both ethical and dietary reasons.“I went to three Greggs stores when the vegan sausage roll came out just to get one – they were so good, this is good too,” she said between mouthfuls of the bake, made from quorn, onions and meat-free gravy. “Two years ago, it was difficult to find places to eat, but now there’s so many cheap options.”Her boyfriend, Joe Swain, 21, a graphic design student also studying at Salford, eats meat but gave the steakbake the thumbs up. “I’d definitely buy that one over the meat one,” he said.Seated nearby, Sarah Taylor and Peter Milne, both 63, were eating tried-and-tested beef steakbakes, having ordered out of habit. “I’ve just been looking at the vegan ones though, and they do look lovely,” said Taylor.According to a recent study from the supermarket chain Waitrose, one in eight Britons are now vegetarian or vegan, with food choices assuming an increasingly important role in countering the climate crisis. But not everyone snapping up the pastry snacks was making a concerted effort to switch to a completely meat-free diet.Anthony Dent, 51, eating at the nearby store on King Street, is one of the UK’s estimated 22 million “flexitarians”, who enjoy meat but want to reduce their intake.His first taste of the vegan steakbake had in fact been influenced by his daughters Olivia, 13, and Heather, 10, who is vegetarian. “They do taste nice, but I eat meat. I’m just being influenced by the younger generation to eat less,” he said.Tearing into a bake on her way to the office, fellow flexitarian and civil servant Rachel, 31, said she would be trying to exercise more self-control when it came to vegan fast food this year.“When the vegan sausage rolls came out I had one for breakfast every day for about two months and had to stop because I was getting a bit fat. I could definitely have this for breakfast though,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6979f4318783fa705864e7e6ee65fcd787a15086/0_83_3100_1860/master/3100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5db72157488e256e94285dc6a2297e8","title":"derby barnsley championship match report","story":"Wayne Rooney’s arrival at Derby might have looked like a gimmick but his debut proved he will be a telling influence in the Championship by inspiring his teammates with actions and words on the pitch.Although he had a hand in both goals against Barnsley his most obvious impact was as a leader. There was no power or pace to his performance, instead he relied on his guile, cunning and passing. Jack Marriott and Martyn Waghorn scored for Derby, either side of an Elliott Simões equaliser, with Rooney at the heart of both home goals.Before Marriott opened the scoring Rooney had lambasted the striker after two missed chances. A goal should have arrived when Waghorn broke down the left and provided a perfect cross for Marriott to convert from 12 yards but he lacked composure, sending the ball well wide.A sign of Rooney the coach came when Marriott fluffed his lines again, slotting wide after being sent through one on one. Upon the ball sliding beyond the post, Rooney berated Marriott, showing he is not just the star of the play but directing it, too. “Players miss chances but the way he was casual and lazy about the shot is why I said to him, ‘you have got to put it in no matter if you are offside or not’. Hopefully he won’t do that again,” Rooney said.The former England striker was deployed at the tip of a midfield diamond, sporting the captain’s armband previously worn by Richard Keogh who was sacked after a late-night car crash. Rooney is in Derby to provide a better example, with the most important arrival in the club’s history replacing the suspended Krystian Bielik.“A lot of people see him as a striker and a goalscorer but his vision of the game is excellent,” the Derby manager, Phillip Cocu, said. “I like the way he plays because he is not focused on himself but he also puts other people in good positions in front of goal. He played a great game.”Rooney proved his worth as a player when he whipped in a dangerous free-kick from a deep position for Marriott to make amends, erting the ball into the bottom corner after getting away from his marker for his first goal in 18 appearances.Barnsley created a rare counterattack five minutes after the break, resulting in Simões toe-poking home a rebound from close range after the original shot was stopped. It was a first professional goal for the striker who arrived a year ago from FC United of Manchester.Rooney should have scored soon after when he found himself unmarked on the edge of the six-yard box but he failed to make connection with his head and the ball bounced wide off his right shoulder. A number of crossfield passes were sent from Rooney to Andre Wisdom 40 yards away. In the 57th minute the ultimate aim was achieved when Wisdom controlled the ball, drove towards the box and pulled a pass back for Waghorn to steer into the corner to restore Derby’s lead.Rooney moved further forward after the withdrawal of Waghorn, sitting behind a lone striker as a No 10. The reason for changing his role was a simple one: the 34-year-old looked tired in the closing stages and pushing out of the centre allowed him to refrain from running as he eased himself towards completing 90 minutes. Cocu realises he needs his captain on the pitch whenever possible.A second consecutive victory for Derby moved them 10 points clear of the teams in the drop zone and Rooney is eyeing the top six. “Looking at the league table we are eight points off the play-offs, so it is catchable. We can make the play-offs with more consistency.”The play-offs may be an optimistic aim but Derby have lacked hope for a long time and Rooney is bringing it back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23b2a5301ce6386aa23e2f92a3c155843078d3ae/179_339_3186_1912/master/3186.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1b22e69daa78b55f38140ed87ba167b","title":"liverpool sheffield united premier league match report","story":"Records and landmarks keep being surpassed as Liverpool’s relentless red machine grinds on. This victory was more of a grind in the end even though Liverpool initially threatened a goalfest the game went quite flat for long periods, but a two-goal margin of victory did not flatter the home side and the overall significance lies in the fact that Jürgen Klopp’s players have now gone unbeaten in the Premier League for a whole year.Only Arsenal and Chelsea have managed that in the Premier League era, and no other top-flight side have made it through the festive period without dropping points.Liverpool faced lively opponents in Leicester, Wolves and Sheffield United, all teams in excellent form, yet each obstacle was cleared, with this third win of the series restoring a 13-point lead at the top of the table with a game in hand. Just about the only cause for optimism for those fearing the title race might be over already is that there has been a detectable fall-off in performance over those three matches. Leicester were stylishly routed, Wolves was a much more close-run thing and, while the outcome of this game was never in much doubt from the moment Liverpool took an early lead, after a bright beginning there were too many slack passes and wasted opportunities for the home crowd’s liking. If Liverpool are tiring, it proves only that they are human after all, though they might just have been managing a difficult situation. There was no need to expend unnecessary energy once in front and Sadio Mané’s second-half goal allowed everyone at Anfield to relax just a little.Liverpool got off to the best possible start with a goal in under four minutes. It was a classic quick strike with a minimum of touches, Virgil van Dijk picking up Andy Robertson’s run down the left and Mohamed Salah ready and waiting for the low cross to supply a crisp first-time finish and, though the margins were quite fine on this occasion, there was no need for VAR interference. Robertson had timed his touchline run to perfection to stay onside, though his job was made easier when the chasing George Baldock slipped on the turf, and Salah was smart enough to delay his move towards the ball until the moment was right.If that was not the opening Sheffield United had hoped for, it could have been worse still a few minutes later, when the lively Salah burst on to a pass from Jordan Henderson and brought a fingertip save from Dean Henderson with another first-time shot. With the visitors largely penned in their own half, Liverpool moved the ball around confidently as if putting on an exhibition. At one point Robertson found Trent Alexander-Arnold with a lofted pass from one touchline to the other, only for the right-back to send the ball immediately back in the direction it had come in an attempt to find Roberto Firmino in the penalty area.When Georginio Wijnaldum shot narrowly over from Sadio Mané’s pass midway through the first half there was a sense that another breakthrough might be imminent, though Mané chose the wrong option when Henderson ran half of the length of the pitch to release him, a slight miscontrol allowing the United defenders to funnel back and cut out his eventual cross.It was not quite all one way – Lys Mousset could have done better than shoot tamely at Alisson with an unmarked John Fleck calling for the ball at the far post – but United were indebted to Dean Henderson again when Mané nudged an Alexander-Arnold prompt into Salah’s path and the goalkeeper had to beat away a goalbound shot. Liverpool were at their most fluent when attacking at speed on the counter rather than attempting to pass their way through a packed defence. United knew that but were still obliged to come forward occasionally to try to get back on terms. Liverpool were not quite as sharp as they have been in recent weeks, with a few passes going astray and Firmino’s touch in particular letting him down in promising situations, and despite a wealth of possession in and around the Blades area they were unable to add to their lead before half-time.Firmino shot just wide at the start of the second half before Salah almost claimed a freak goal with an effort that trickled through a crowd of defenders and came back off a surprised Henderson’s right-hand upright. The goalkeeper saw the ball only at the last moment but acted quickly enough to prevent it trickling over his line. Mané’s goal, just past the hour, came from his own determined break down the right. He fed Salah in the middle and carried on running, so that the return pass found him in front of goal, where he was able to beat Henderson at the second attempt. It was a goal considerably less scruffy than it looked. Robertson’s initial pass to Mané was excellent, Mané’s intelligent run even better, and the coolness of Salah’s final pass almost sublime. He might not have meant to do exactly that, but it worked, and for Liverpool at the moment everything works and little else matters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a96477acac0bc35d4fbe0e70aa7b2ac19f3fd0b2/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=767d6f50754844b9488f87440bc7b419","title":"fa cup third round 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Minamino’s Merseyside derby baptism, Woodgate’s Tottenham reunion and non-league Fylde take on Sheffield UnitedConsidering they have been fairly regular visitors over the years, Derby’s record at Selhurst Park is pretty miserable. Indeed in their past 15 trips – a run stretching back to 1983 – they’ve won only once. That victory came in 2002 when Georgi Kinkladze scored the only goal of the game. A big-name big-money player past his peak helping the Rams to an unlikely win in south London? You might be able to spot where this is going. Wayne Rooney made his playing return to English football on Thursday night and played a full 90 minutes in the 2-1 defeat of Barnsley in which his free-kick supplied Jack Marriott’s opening goal. Two games in four days might be aa stretch for a 34-year-old who had not played since October but he could prove quite the talisman: while Derby’s record at Selhurst is poor, Rooney’s is not – he has never been on the losing side at the ground. JA• Crystal Palace v Derby County (Sunday, 2.01pm, all times GMT)Alex Neil and Daniel Farke have at least one thing in common: both men know what it is to lead Norwich City through a campaign in the Premier League’s nether reaches and it is not quite too late, despite their recent results, for Farke’s current vintage to escape the fate experienced by Neil and his crop in 2015-16. They finished 19th that year and, towards the end of the following season, Neil would be sacked. Such is the style and verve Farke has brought to Norwich that it is difficult to envisage a similar outcome a year from now even if they go down, but football moves in mysterious ways. To emphasise the point it is not inconceivable Neil’s Preston North End side, only a point shy of the Championship play-offs even if their festive form was poor, will swap places with his former club in May. He has done an impressive job at Deepdale and it is easy to forget, given that his managerial career began in 2013, he is still only 38. He will fancy his chances of upstaging Norwich for one afternoon, at least: the Canaries have exited in the third round for six straight seasons. NAFylde may be the lowest ranked team left in this year’s FA Cup, but the National League side are by no means the poorest. Financed by local businessman David Haythornthwaite and based at the extremely well appointed Mill Farm complex near the Lancashire town of Kirkham, the Coasters are the envy of their non-League brethren and, like Salford City before them, have been accused of trying to buy their way into the Football League. Fylde’s detractors will be delighted to see that on the pitch this season things have been going rather less swimmingly. Dave Challinor was sacked as manager in October after eight years in charge and while results briefly picked up under Jim Bentley, the club is in in danger of being relegated. Although a trip to Bramall Lane may prove a welcome distraction, getting a result against Sheffield United is likely to prove beyond these ambitious minnows. BGWhen the third-round draw was made at the start of December this tie smacked of a routine away win for the Premier League side. Tottenham seemed to have turned the corner, with José Mourinho’s first two games resulting in a couple of 3-2 wins. Middlesbrough, on the other hand, had just been hammered 4-0 by Leeds, a result that extended a dismal run of form to one win in 12 in the Championship and left them perilously close to the bottom three. Jonathan Woodgate was on the brink of the sack, with Neil Warnock reportedly being lined up as a replacement. A month later, though, Boro come into this tie on the back of four wins on the bounce and are beginning to ponder a play-off push, while Spurs’ Christmas hangover has included a draw at Norwich and a defeat at Southampton. All of a sudden this is not a trip Tottenham will be relishing in the slightest. JAAlthough glamorous enough on paper to have been handpicked by TV executives for the Monday night slot on BBC, in reality Leeds United’s visit to Arsenal may end up being something of a damp squib. With his side leading the Championship at this time last year, Marcelo Bielsa sent a youthful side to play QPR, where they duly lost. Leeds ultimately failed to secure promotion last season, coming up short in the play-offs but they remain in the box-seat to go up automatically at their second attempt under Bielsa. The distraction of an FA Cup run is one they could almost certainly do without and their manager is likely to pick his team for the Emirates accordingly. Following his players’ exertions against Manchester United, Mikel Arteta is also likely to pick a second-string side, although given the insatiable lust of Arsenal fans for the first trophy of the post-Wenger era one suspects a win for whatever team Arsenal field will suit both managers just fine. BGWhile in a perfect, happy-clappy world, each and every team would do try their damnedest to win the FA Cup, the benefits of losing in the third round cannot be overstated for Premier League clubs with more pressing concerns. Seven top-flight teams came a cropper at the first time of asking last season and were duly rewarded with an 11-day winter break later in the month while their rivals prepared for and played in the fourth round. After the gruelling Christmas schedule, what manager wouldn’t fancy a period of recalibration in sunnier clines? While helpful, it is worth noting that these impromptu winter breaks are no guarantee of league success – of the seven top flight teams to go out in the third round last season, three were relegated comes the season’s end. BGQuite a lot of water has passed under the bridge since these two sides last bumped into each other in the winter of 2008-09. That season featured two draws between the teams as Bournemouth (who were deducted 17 points after financial problems) finished 21st in League Two and Luton (deducted 30 points for being in a right old mess) ended up dead last, tumbling into the Conference. Since those dark days both clubs have largely been on an upward trajectory (though not in the FA Cup: Bournemouth have been past the third round only twice since then, Luton only once), one that has taken the Cherries into the Premier League and the Hatters to the Championship. But their engines are just beginning to stutter – away defeats five miles apart in London this week are reason for anxiety in both camps. Bournemouth’s 4-0 hammering at West Ham leaves them in the bottom three, while Luton’s 3-1 loss at Millwall left them holding up the rest of the Championship. So both teams need to balance the desire to keep players fresh for their respective relegation battles with the need for a morale-boosting victory. JASunday will mark exactly two years since one Virgil van Dijk set a resounding tone for his impact at Liverpool. Van Dijk scored a last-gasp header to win the third-round derby against Everton at Anfield on his debut and, while the other end at the pitch is where he has helped change Jürgen Klopp’s team beyond recognition, as a way of gaining early favour it could hardly have been better. Takumi Minamino may not end up having as profound an impact on Liverpool’s entire balance but the former Red Bull Salzburg schemer is likely to make his own bow. What were the odds of this tie being drawn out again, and what price another arrival to remember? Minamino should be well rested, given his last action was on 10 December against his new club, but more importantly his performance in that Champions League fixture suggested he has the high-intensity style required to hit the ground running. If he can repeat Van Dijk’s impact, it could signify good times ahead. NA• Liverpool v Everton (4.01pm, Sunday)These days the FA Cup tends to mean tales of giantkilling derring-do from Mike Flynn and his Newport County side. It has also come to inspire heroics from Millwall, flying under Gary Rowett and currently sitting in the Championship’s top six, have reached the quarter-finals twice in the last three seasons Newport have beaten Leeds and Leicester since January 2018, also holding Spurs and giving Manchester City a game, so in theory it should not take too much for some blood and thunder to occur. Millwall’s unexpected successcomes at a price though, with Rowett likely to rotate, while Newport have not won in 10 League Two games and will prioritise their climbing into the play-off picture. “The league is our bread and butter, so I’d prefer to have another league game coming up,” their striker Jamille Matt admitted this week. His colleague Padraig Amond should be feeling hungry for more cup success though: Amond has scored in eight successive rounds of the competition, ning this season and last, and continuing that run this weekend would put him three short of Stan Mortensen’s all-time record. NA• Millwall v Newport (12.31pm, Saturday)On Thursday, Port Vale were held to a 2-2 draw at home by crisis club Macclesfield Town in League Two. On Saturday they travel to Manchester City to see how the other half live and, to make sure as many dyed-in-the-wool fans of the Potteries club as possible get their chance to attend, Vale came up with a novel tiebreaker when they received an extra batch of tickets from City. Those seeking a nibble at the increased allocation had to send in a 300-word mini-essay detailing how they have supported Vale over the years, and why they should be included in a ballot. Those who got lucky will dream that John Askey’s team can emulate a result from times past. Vale visited Maine Road on 4 November 1997and their 3-2 win is often cited among the depths City had to plumb in sinking to the third tier. The swing in fortunes seen since will almost certainly never be reversed but Vale, 10th in a ision whose wider financial troubles may only just be beginning, will appreciate the payday and if a few of those present 22 years ago got lucky in the ballot then it might rekindle a few fond old memories.

Here’s how to get in the habitMuch like going for a run or eating your greens, saving your cash offers long-term benefits, but is not always appealing. And, let’s face it, there are always good reasons not to lock your money away – confusion over different accounts, fear of making the wrong choice, or feeling as though you don’t have enough money to make it worthwhile can all outweigh the best intentions. But, as the NHS’s Couch to 5K programme taught us about exercise, things are a lot less overwhelming if you start small and build up.Don’t worry if you have been putting it off for years – you can’t be too old to start saving. Whatever your age, you need to decide that saving is something you want, or need, to do, says Iona Bain, the founder of the blog Young Money. After all, she points out, “saving is only possible with motivation”.If you are struggling to feel driven, she has advice: “Saving gives you choices in the future. Once you start understanding that it’s still your money, just put somewhere safe in case you need it, you start finding that motivation that will make saving much easier.”Don’t start a savings account if you have expensive debt to pay off – you will be better off clearing an overdraft or credit card, as they charge higher interest rates than you can earn. But once these debts are cleared, you can start to think about building a nest egg.One option is to set up a monthly standing order to pay into a savings account just after you have been paid. The logic here is that if you cannot see the money in your current account you will not spend it. This is a good choice if you know how much you can afford to save each month.If you don’t, you can squirrel away money throughout the month using a round-up feature. Offered by the new online banks, including Revolut, Starling and Monzo, as well as Lloyds TSB and Halifax, these let you round up any spending to the nearest £1 and put the difference into a savings pot. So, if you spend £1.45, you will be debited £2, of which 55p will be squirrelled away.Alternatively, you could wait until the end of the month and sweep what is left in your current account into your savings. You can do this with any bank, but First Direct’s 1st account can be set up to do this automatically.As with Couch to 5K, it can be helpful to have a goal. Small, short-term targets are good at first, because they are achievable and will get you into good habits. It might be tickets for a show or an activity you have wanted to see for a long time, a new pair of jeans or a night away. Whatever it is, work out how much you need and when you need it.Once you have achieved your aim, do not close your account. You are in the habit now, so keep going.Bain says not to worry too much about savings rates at this point, but if you want an extra incentive, a website such as Savings Champion will show you the best-paying accounts. If you want to be able to withdraw your money in the next year, take a look at easy-access accounts.If you are saving for a property, think about using a Lifetime Isa. If you want to save for the long term, start exploring pensions and other investments. Some of these have minimum payment levels as low as £1, although small investments may disappear in fees, so you will need more to make it worthwhile – £25 a month is more typical and meaningful.“If you are investing over a short time period, certainly fewer than five years, then you should stick with cash, even though interest rates are currently at very low levels,” says Patrick Connolly, a chartered financial planner at the advice firm Chase de Vere. “This is because, if you invest in the stock market and it falls in value, you will have very little time to claw back any losses.”A good starting place if you have a small sum and do not want to take much risk is a fund that tracks the UK stock market.

But can any of them keep our writers moving?Price £15.49 a month.What is it? A full-service experience from the Hollywood star Chris Hemsworth: not just workouts, but a complete meal planner – with food for breakfast, lunch and dinner – a daily guided meditation and a daily motivational article.The experience I immediately regret declaring myself “intermediate” as the app launches into a punishing pilates workout. I am not very flexible at all, and it turns out that my baseline fitness leaves much to be desired in terms of core strength.More frustrating is the fact that the various workouts are introduced as videos. Clearly, this is supposed to emulate a real pilates class, but when my phone tells me to lie face-down on the floor I can no longer see the screen. It is frustrating to have to repeatedly break out of the pose to check the next movement.Worth a download? Only if you are single, enjoy cooking and are willing to hand control of your life to an app.AHPrice $14.99 (£11.40) a month or $99.99 a year.What is it? A cheery selection of audio workouts with curated tunes.The experience Before I start, the app asks me my fitness level, how many times I work out a week, how many weeks a month, what days I work out on, what machines I have access to, and what equipment I have to hand. None of this stops it from absolutely destroying me with bodyweight exercises – but it is the thought that counts.The instructors are great, with the right level of enthusiasm (read: grating in any other context). I am glad to have clear verbal instructions for how to do the exercises, rather than wishing I could just read a list of workouts from my screen. Video walkthroughs, available before and after the workout, help clear up any lingering concerns about form.Worth a download? If you want to get fit to the tune of £75 a year, this is the app to spend your money on. AHPrice Free coaching from $1 a day.What is it? A bizarre mix of a mediocre workout app and personal trainer upselling.The experience You get what you pay for, and as a result the free version of Fitocracy is odd. The main workout app lets you set a goal, then pick workouts from a list, but the presentation of the workouts is much simpler than its competitors: just a list of exercises and reps, which you check off as you go.The problem is that much of the app is effectively broken, with visual artefacts – graphical glitches – all over the place. Digging in, the cause is clear: really, the app is a gateway to a coaching business, where you can spend anything from $1 to $250 a month on a one-on-one consultation with a personal trainer.Worth a download? If you want free, there is better if you want a coach, head to your local gym. AHPrice £17.49 a year.What is it? A simple and direct approach to strength.The experience A popular approach to learning to lift free weights, 5x5 involves doing five sets of five reps of heavy weights, with three different exercises, three times a week.It demands precisely what it does and no more. You need a gym, a squat rack, a barbell and a bench. You don’t need to memorise a list of different exercises, nor wonder which equipment you are going to need today, nor, really, think.StrongLifts is the best introduction to this type of workout there is, providing basic coaching and tracking, as well as just enough motivation to get you to lift the next set. It is my personal favourite: in a year, I have gone from struggling with a 20kg bar to reliably squatting my own weight.Worth a download? Yes, if you have access to a gym and don’t know what to do when you are there. AHPrice Free £13.49 a month for the premium version.What is it? Slick branded workouts with a generous free offering.The experience Nike Training Club, the workout sibling to the more popular Nike Run Club, feels less human than its competitors. While the personal trainers are front and centre, they mostly exist as silent models demonstrating the best form for each exercise.That may suit a certain type of self-motivated student. Less helpful, for me, is the approach to equipment. I feel as if Nike expects me to have an incredibly well-stocked home – with multiple dumbbells, a skipping rope and a bench – or make myself hugely unpopular at the gym by seizing six things at once. That said, most of the app is available for free – a price you can’t beat.Worth a download? Yes, if free is the magic number. AHPrice £14.99 a month or £88 a year.What is it? The chance to have your workout (for the home and gym) and diet plan organised by not only one Instagram influencer, but five – inspired by everything from powerlifting and muay thai to yoga.The experience Kayla Itsines was one of the first internet exercise influencers. She rose to fame with the Bikini Body Guides, her series of fitness ebooks (the name hasn’t aged well). Itsines still offers the BBG programme, but it now includes variations for different fitness levels. This feels like an app that could stay fresh for well over a year. I like that there are modifications for various exercises, that it is easy to sync to Spotify, and that it put so much emphasis on rest and rehabilitation to enhance healing.The meal-planning features are disappointing, though. There is no option to swap suggested recipes, but as some of the suggestions are as unimaginative as “egg and salad roll”, I imagine quite a few people would want to.Worth a download? Yes – for the exercise, at least.CKPrice $9.99 a month or $59.99 a year.What is it? It is all about exercise on Sworkit, and there is a hell of a lot of it. You can choose from a variety of plans or one-off workouts, customisable by time or focused on body parts (Sworkit is quite invested in firming bums).The experience This has one of the best interfaces for exercising of the apps I tried. It works in landscape, counts you in before the next exercise starts and has a preview window to mentally prepare you for the next move. You can alter music within the exercise window and set how long you want to exercise for, with sessions beginning at five minutes. It also has a great voiceover feature: think of the sort of thing a gym instructor might say, such as “keep your toes pointing outward”. The app sends out push notifications to encourage you to exercise, but the upkeep of a plan does not depend on exercising every day. So, beginners can set their own pace.I can’t work out if the instructor figures on Sworkit are AI or humans, but either way I liked them. Sworkit has tried to make its instructors erse – there are men and women in a variety of sizes. It is a small thing, but I appreciate not always having to follow someone with the figure of a goddess.Worth a download? Yes, especially for beginners. None of Sworkit’s sessions require equipment, so if you ever work out at home or while travelling, it can’t be beaten. CKPrice $16.99 a month.What is it? The Instagram influencer Anna Victoria rose to fame with her downloadable workout plans known as the FBGs (or Fit Body Guides) and pictures of smoothie bowls. Here, she brings together her fitness and food advice in one app, offering 12-week exercise and nutrition programmes, including a customisable meal planner.The experience The app provides a series of 12-week plans to last you 60 weeks (for home or gym, for weight loss or sculpting etc), a forum for users, a journal to log notes and a healthy-meal planner, which aims to spoon-feed the user into eating well (the nutrition section generates your recipes and grocery list for the week as well as reminding you when to drink water).I couldn’t get to grip with all of this, but when I tried it out there were some excellent features – a nutrition guide that is not just about calorie-counting (although the variety of the dishes may bore food lovers), plus educational videos (such as breathing dos and don’ts) to help newcomers to regular exercise. The downsides? The app doesn’t work in landscape mode, so checking the demo during workouts is difficult. Also, workouts often require equipment. I am not convinced the app would work for total novices (push-ups in week one for a woman seems ambitious, not to mention the amount of vicious burpees), while scanning future weeks leaves me wondering if it might get boring.Worth a download? Unless you are a fan of Victoria and her style, I can’t see it delivering enough. CKPrice £1.78 a week for training £2.66 including nutrional information.What is it? Touted as a digital personal trainer, this app has a cultish fanbase thanks to its detailed personalised fitness plans. The experience You can join in with the short but intense fitness challenges, or a variety of running, bodyweight or gym workouts. Users can opt for workouts anywhere between 10 and 25 minutes long, and can select sessions based on parts of the body. So far, so normal. But it is the Coach programme that stands out. The personal plans are created by algorithms that pool the data of users with similar stats to chart your journey. Key to this is regular logging you will record your details when you first start (height, weight, general fitness level) and log after each workout, telling the app how tough you found it.Freeletics promises its workouts will be hard, but not so hard that you give up. It is the feedback moments that allow it to alter your plan accordingly, based on the behaviour of other users who had similar experiences. As with a real coach, there are plenty of demo videos and tutorials to guide you through, plus helpful nudges to drink water and sleep well. The Coach can even detect if you are overtraining. Freeletics also has a fairly busy meetup community, providing some of the social elements of exercise that can be lost when training at home. Plus, the exercises don’t require any equipmentWorth a download? Absolutely, if you have some experience of exercising – it could be a little overwhelming for a total newbie. CKPrice Free from £1.99 a week for the premium version.What is it? A 30-day programme with levels from beginner to pro.The experience Month-long challenges have become a staple of modern fitness. This app capitalises on the idea that people can do anything if it is in short bursts, hence the idea of daily sessions for 30 days.Most of the challenges are focused on a specific area – there is the “flat belly challenge” and the “slim arms challenge” – but nearly all involve a full-body workout. The video tutorials are clear and there are 400 workouts in the library if you feel like doing something completely different outside of the challenge. The end result should be that your overall fitness is improved.Worth a download? Absolutely – 30-day challenges may not be for everyone, but, unlike many other apps, there is plenty to do for free.

Sex tapes, terrible singing and off-the-cuff sofa jokes that ignite the far right. Sounds great! There are two ways to spend New Year’s Eve, as best as I can tell: you either dirty the floor of a house party and spend the smallest of the small hours running desperately out of drinkable alcohol until you realise it’s 7am and the sun is up and you just watched yourself pour Pepsi Max into half a cup of Bailey’s until they both curdled into a sort of vomitty pâté or you watched Jools at home with a blanket over your legs, in bed with your teeth brushed by 10 past 12. You get absolutely zero points for guessing which one of the two I saw the new year in with. My body is still shaking.Fair to say, too, that celebrities have yet to emerge blinkingly into the new decade. In the Christmas lull, the famous go into one of two modes of hibernation: either posting a succession of matching-pyjama family selfies in million-pound mansions that are identically decorated with plush beige carpets and tasteful but anonymous tonal greys or going on holiday somewhere unthinkably lush and posting: “How’s the weather back home!” while sizzling in a hammock over aquamarine Malian waters. What I am saying is that there is no news, all right, and we can’t spend 1,200 words having a go at Cats again, so we simply have to preview the year 2020 and have a stab at guessing what the world of fame has for us. Is it a cop-out? Or is it actually quite a decent effort for someone who still has “brandy” in his system and who many doctors would advise shouldn’t be sitting upright at this still-early stage in his hangover? Well exactly. Let’s get on with it.Nothing says “too many people said ‘yes’ to me and I forgot what reality means any more” like a non-singing celebrity attempting a singing career, and in 2020 – with the advent of X Factor: Celebrity and The Masked Singer – we are perfectly primed for someone famous-for-one-thing making the leap into being-famous-for-another-thing. Previously, it’s either been newly departed but much-beloved soap actors (The Martine McCutcheon Principle) or long-running TV staples bizarrely outselling everyone in sight (Walshian Mechanics), but we forget that we’re living under an unprecedented influx of nü-fame Love Island graduates, and at least one of them is surely able enough to hold a tune. From last summer’s lot – soon to be eclipsed by the shiny new winter intake – my best guess is Tommy Fury, too impatient to work his way up the ranks of his boxing career, pivoting instead to earnest YouTube covers. He’ll pioneer a new genre that comes to be known as “thick rap”. By the end of 2021 he’s selling out European arena tours and is richer than God.Say what you want about Katie Hopkins – it’s not like she can afford another libel case – but she did prove that the American model of going full rightwing crank could be a lucrative one, and it’s strange that, in this tinderbox political moment, more celebrities haven’t yet followed suit. The shape of it is always the same: one This Morning appearance with a slightly-right-of-centre opinion about something innocuous (“All I’m saying is, why should my taxes pay for other people’s children to eat lunch? If you’re gonna have a hungry kid, don’t have a kid”), an unexpected boost in people tweeting you “Bravo” as a result, then you double-down harder and harder until LBC gives you a phone-in show and you release a book called Telling It Like It Is, where you pull a quizzical eyebrow and firmly fold your arms on the cover before getting a million new Twitter followers and an invite to the White House so Donald Trump can shake your hand. I think Mark Wright is in prime position to do this: he could shake off his nice-guy Matalan-model Heart-FM shtick and make good on being the shagger bastard early seasons of Towie always told us he could be. Seriously, can’t you see him turning an errant “how many flipping genders do we need?” comment on an episode of Loose Women into a million-dollar empire, breaking the States, appearing on Fox News in a suit with too many buttons on it and doing a lucrative red-state college tour that keeps getting shut down by protesters?One of the best things celebrities do is read exactly one article about a massive social problem they were never previously aware of then immediately make it Their Thing, turning every media appearance, tweet and Instagram post into a reminder of society’s ills for about two-and-a-half months, then forgetting about it entirely when something else comes along. Gemma Collins is already quite good at this – she advocates for animal rights, veganism and high glam in one ongoing stream of consciousness on her Twitter feed – and I feel like she’ll add “the dying environment” to that list this year, tweeting direct @s to Boris Johnson about wind turbines (“Why arent there more of them bozza?”) before an undercover investigation into her own personal jet usage finds out she somehow flew to Scotland 12 times in two weeks to make a recurring personal appearance at a perfume event.Here are two indisputable facts: it has been far, far too long since we had a viable celebrity sex tape no social media platform has truly made it until someone has, accidentally or otherwise, put their dick on it. With the late-2019 popularity and as-yet-scandal-free existence of TikTok, this constitutes a perfect storm, and there’s surley only one man ready and able to take advantage of it: Wayne Lineker. The start of 2020’s summer season will be marked with him firmly performing doggy-style in the reflection of a hotel mirror while mouthing along to LMFAO’s Party Rock Anthem, then one billion views on Pornhub and O Beach Ibiza is sold out for years to come. “Best thing I ever did,” Lineker growls, when interviewed about it some months afterwards, “whatever her name was.”Jessie J will pivot to K-Pop."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65f88d2842790def3aa60df6a9f8fa921b43379a/0_295_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03814c429e1f36022d55604e645d8f6e","title":"alerting amazon about its unsafe lamp cost me 221","story":"I bought a therapy lamp from China via Amazon but it didn’t meet EU regulatory standardsI am a recently qualified acupuncturist and purchased through Amazon a £111 specialised heat lamp for therapy sessions.

In this small and sweaty venue, a Swedish heavy metal band are opening their set with a song about the exploits of Field Marshall Rommel’s infamous 7th panzer ision in the second world war. They follow it with a number about the horrors of Passchendaele in the first world war.By the end of the night, we will have had exuberant hymns to Lawrence of Arabia, an all-female Soviet bomber squadron and the military genius King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. Everyone in the room, the vast majority of whom are wearing Sabaton shirts, sings along with absolutely everything. Meanwhile, the venue gently rocks from side to side, because we are on a ship in the middle of the Baltic Sea.Welcome to the 10th annual Sabaton Cruise: The Battleship, where passions for military history and Olympic-standard drinking collide. Sabaton may be an unfamiliar name to non-metalheads, but they won’t be for long. Other than veterans Iron Maiden, they are the biggest heavy metal band in Europe. Their last album, The Great War, reached No 1 in Sweden, Germany and Switzerland and No 11 in the UK – very respectable for a heavy metal band.What’s more, the band have made significant inroads into the notoriously Euro-phobic US rock market. In addition to their annual cruise (which has sold out every time), they have also been running their Sabaton Open Air festival in their home city of Falun, in central Sweden, since 2008, and have their own history channel on YouTube, where the stories behind their military history-themed songs are explored at length by academics and historians. Every diehard fan crammed into the ship’s mini-theatre has completely bought into the whole thing. The response, as Sabaton conclude the show with pummelling metal jig Swedish Pagans, is deafening and utterly joyful.The following morning, swarms of brutally hungover fans stagger chaotically towards the ship’s buffet restaurant for sustenance. Others stumble out on deck into sub-zero temperatures for a fag. Everyone seems to have survived the night without falling overboard. For all heavy metal’s reputation for rowdiness, the Sabaton cruise has a lovely family vibe – Mikael, from Stavanger, in Norway, tells me he fell asleep in one of the restaurants, but was helpfully carried to his cabin by some Germans. With a Sabaton quiz, heavy-metal karaoke and a merchandise stall selling a bewildering number of items for all sizes, genders and tastes, it all feels very inclusive and cosy. The band’s obsession with war stories ensures that we are all learning something, too.“Every school system I’ve ever encountered has been very effective at turning something interesting, like history, into something boring,” says Joakim Brodén, the band’s mohawked, musclebound frontman. “Of course you have to learn facts and figures, but that can be so boring. If you zoom in and tell stories, like the tale of Witold Pilecki, a guy who went voluntarily to infiltrate Auschwitz and support the resistance? These are human stories – people from every nation and every culture can relate to them.”The band love military history so much that when they heard that a museum on the site of the UK’s only first world war battle was in financial trouble – Heugh Battery Museum in Hartlepool – they created a special T-shirt design and raised £4,000.As educational as their songs are designed to be, Sabaton are aware that their obsession with military events, and the grimmest aspects of war, could be misconstrued as ghoulish, flippant or possibly even politically dubious. There’s no doubting that the band’s motivations are entirely honourable, but Brodén does say they have to remain mindful of the emotional power of these tumultuous tales. “We played the song 40:1 on the battlefield in Wizna, Poland, exactly 70 years after the battle of Wizna happened,” he says. “We had the Swedish ambassador there and 10,000 fans, and we were in the field where it actually happened – you could see the fire, literally, in the fans’ eyes. Those songs are often the most fun but they can be a little scary, too. We’re singing about military history because it’s fascinating. We’re not pushing nationalistic propaganda.”Brodén and bassist Pär Sundström are the sole remaining members of the original Sabaton lineup, and have nurtured their band over two decades: Brodén writes the music, while Sundström seems to be responsible for everything else. Aside from being Sabaton’s manager, he books their shows and deals with logistics, stage sets and a steady stream of new projects he can’t stop dreaming up. “Nobody tells us when or where to play, how to build a stage, how to do accounting,” he says. “Give me a problem to solve and some tools – and I’ll find something I can build with them. I’ll want to build something bigger than everything else.”This includes the Sabaton History channel. Sundström’s piercing blue eyes light up as he explains the thinking behind it. Conceived to flesh out the military stories behind the band’s songs, each episode has led to a surge in streams and album sales. “It’s definitely not paying off in terms of direct income, but not everything needs to do that,” he says, adding that they are turning their website in “an encyclopaedia of military history. You can see how each day in history relates to Sabaton. So you can read about it, watch it, listen to it – we’ll get you one way or the other!”On board the “battleship” (in reality a standard cruise ship, albeit a huge one), there is plenty of evidence that Sabaton’s remorseless pursuit of new ways to attract fans has led to the creation of a genuine community. Up to 40 different countries are represented among the cruise’s 3,000 punters, and Brodén seems thrilled to have brought so many people together. “The Polish fan club started hanging out with the German fan club and so on. I must’ve bumped into 100 people I recognised yesterday.”Several unexpectedly successful tours in the US disproved the notion that, as Sundström claims to have been repeatedly told, “Americans don’t like power metal”. But even within metal circles, the Swedes have seldom been favoured candidates for world domination. Sabaton albums have generally been greeted with an appreciative but noncommittal shrug from the rock and metal press. So-called “power metal” – a brightly melodic and fast-paced strain of old-school metal – has never sought to be cool, and is easily ignored. But while many younger, ostensibly cooler bands have risen and fallen, this defiantly traditional quintet have marched stoically onwards, oblivious to time or trends but dragging a phenomenal number of people along with them.“It’s always been a steady, upward march. We’ve never had a moment where we’ve lost our footing,” Brodén notes, almost sheepishly. “For me, personally, I had one ‘What the fuck?’ moment in Athens in 2009. We were playing in an underground club, not a huge show, and I think we were playing Ghost Division. Suddenly, everything went into slow motion. I realised, ‘Hmm, I’m in Athens having a good time, playing a show, and I haven’t done anything else for the past two years. I guess I’m a professional musician!’”“We were never welcomed into the music industry, especially in Sweden,” adds Sundström. “We are the outsiders, the ugly guys that they don’t want at their parties. A lot of people thought they could ignore us and we’d go away, but they were wrong. Now they have a big problem because they have to write about us and we’re selling their magazines, but they missed the boat, so to speak.” He hoots with laughter.The ship is heading back to Stockholm and Sabaton are bringing the cruise to a close with a second lengthy set full of songs of heroism, bravery, tragedy and horror, with historically pertinent visuals blazing from screens behind them. The band are clearly having as much fun as the fans, despite being (we assume) considerably less inebriated. The last song, To Hell and Back, is a blistering paean to the poetry of US veteran and actor Audie Murphy and goes down so well it nearly sinks the ship.

Cummings warned: “You will not have weekday date nights, you will sacrifice many weekends — frankly it will be hard having a boygirlfriend at all.“It will be exhausting but interesting and if you cut it you will be involved in things at the age of 21 that most people never see.”Cummings added that he did not want to hire “confident public school bluffers” in the role.Described as a “mad professor” and an “evil genius,”, Cummings ran the Vote Leave campaign and is credited with creating the “take back control” and “£350m for the NHS” slogans.But he has clashed with officials and Tory grandees in the past, and has not held back with his opinions on other high-profile Brexiters such as David Davis, whom he once labelled as “lazy as a toad” and as “thick as mince”.He was played by Benedict Cumberbatch in a film about the 2016 referendum called Brexit: The Uncivil War.The post was launched after Rachel Wolf, who helped draw up the blueprint of Tory election pledges, said civil servants could be made to take regular exams to prove they are up to their jobs.Under “seismic” changes being planned by No 10, she also said that civil servants are “woefully unprepared” for sweeping reforms.Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, which represents senior civil servants, warned that the PM’s allies are exhibiting a “fundamental misunderstanding” of the modern civil service."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d568e49e9f6d0ec29ea6d30ba75dffdcc11936a/0_241_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d043380f477653f2193475e0cc08c09d","title":"labour leader favourite starmer calls to rebuild party as force for good","story":"YouGov poll shows Starmer in lead to head party over nearest rival Rebecca Long-BaileySir Keir Starmer, the favourite to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader, has called for the party to become a “trusted force for good” as up to nine rival candidates consider whether to stand next week.The shadow Brexit secretary is seen as the candidate to beat following a YouGov poll showing he has a commanding lead over nearest rival and Corbyn ally Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary.In his first comments since the release of the poll, Starmer refused to officially confirm that he would stand, instead telling Sky News: “The most important thing is that the Labour party is rebuilt, we learn the lessons of the last general election, reflect on them, and address them. But we need the Labour party as a trusted force for good.”The poll’s findings, which did not include either affiliated or registered supporters, have prompted some concern among MPs and members who believe Starmer, the member for Holborn and St Pancras, is the wrong candidate to win over seats in the Midlands and the North that were lost to the Tories in the general election.Neil Coyle, MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark and a supporter of Phillips, said “another white bloke from Islington” was not going to win back Labour’s lost heartlands.Long-Bailey, the MP for Salford and Eccles, has been seen as the candidate to continue Corbyn’s transformation of the party. Ian Lavery, Labour’s chairman, said that he is still considering his options despite speculation that he may drop out to ensure that Long-Bailey has a smooth path. A spokesman said Lavery has been “inundated with requests from Labour members and supporters asking him to stand”.Lisa Nandy, the MP for Wigan is expected to make a decision this weekend after being urged to stand by union and party members. The only candidates to declare so far are the shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and the shadow treasury minister Clive Lewis.Yvette Cooper, the former welfare secretary who has long been touted as a possible leadership candidate, is expected to rule herself out of the contest. A friend told the : “The party membership is currently looking for someone who has been in Jeremy’s shadow cabinet not someone who has been in the actual cabinet under Gordon Brown.”Others considering whether to stand include David Lammy, the Labour member for Tottenham, and Dan Jarvis, the Sheffield City mayor.The contest has to take at least five weeks, according to party rules, but the actual timetable will be decided by a meeting of the party’s national executive committee on 6 January.Some on the left of the party have grown increasingly concerned that Starmer could be buoyed by a “centrist insurgence” of registered supporters – members who pay a one-off fee to vote in the leadership contest.A party source said that members of the party’s ruling body which is dominated by Corbyn supporters are being asked to open registration for a limited period.“There is real concern that there could be an influx of people who don’t share the party’s values,” the source said.Under Labour’s preferential voting system other candidates would be successively knocked out.The YouGov poll does not include affiliates such as trade unions and registered supporters, who have also been able to vote in previous elections. Exact rules for this contest are still being finalised."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d71061cecf6f2b6bd9faa8cd6d6c724ff20b1af/0_0_4759_2857/master/4759.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65c7275758741869a2d38c23edd2f772","title":"patriotism cannot be progressive if it masks hostility and prejudice","story":"Rebecca Long Bailey (Journal, 30 December) cites, as an example of what she calls “progressive patriotism”, support by Lancashire mill workers in 1862 for Abraham Lincoln’s war to end slavery in the United States. It was indeed a generous act supported by the Liberal MP for Manchester, a mill owner, Sir Tom Bazley, and was part of a wider Manchester campaign for free trade – best exemplified today by the no-frontier trade of the EU.However, in 1917, unions representing railway workers, miners and engineering workers passed a resolution to stop “coloured”, Chinese and other foreign workers coming to help Britain produce more arms and food in the first world war. In 1945, Polish soldiers who stayed in Britain were sent down mines to dig vital coal. British miners refused to work with them so separate shifts and even working men’s clubs were set up to keep them apart.In 1968 London dock workers and Covent Garden porters marched to Westminster to support Enoch Powell’s xenophobic demagogy.In our own time there are not a few Labour MPs and trade union leaders who have played into the hands of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage with denunciations of EU citizens working and paying taxes in Britain.Edith Cavell, the British nurse based in Brussels, shot by the Germans as a spy in 1915, famously said: “Patriotism is not enough.” Loving your country and its fellow citizens is one thing, but invoking patriotism with or without an adjective like “progressive” is dangerous political territory.Dr Denis MacShaneFormer Europe minister• After all the build-up, Rebecca Long Bailey’s opening statement of intent felt like the political equivalent of the X-Men Dark Phoenix film – you’re led to expect fireworks and all you get is a damp squib.Long Bailey has tried to cover all bases and alienate none. We get references to an undefined “progressive patriotism”, alongside “pride”, “dignity”, “common purpose” and “pluralism”. This is like an abstracted version of the Labour manifesto – whatever buzzword you want, it’s there. If this is the kind of hard thinking Labour intends to do between now and the next election, we may be in for a long five years.What does “progressive patriotism” actually mean? I’m proud of the working-class history in this country that encompasses the General Strike and the NHS. I’m not proud of the country that carried out the Bloody Sunday killings and invaded Iraq. I don’t believe it helps us develop a progressive working-class politics to seek to obfuscate over this. Does the notion of “progressive patriotism” make it easier or harder to separate these histories out?In the end, isn’t the dismal key to this statement the line “Over the next few years, our task is to rebuild the broad base of support that will get us into government”? Doesn’t this just mean that the inevitable struggles for day-to-day survival under Johnson should be subordinated to delivering up a Labour government? Isn’t the lesson that Labour needs to learn exactly the opposite of this – that unless it somehow becomes part of the means of defence of working-class life, within real communities, it will remain irrelevant?Nick MossLondon• Join the debate – email • Read more  letters – click here to visit guletters• Do you have a photo you’d like to share with  readers?

We’re increasingly experiencing unseasonal heatwaves, dangerous flooding and extreme weather,” explains WWF climate change specialist, Isabella O’Dowd. “The government, businesses and iniduals have an important role to play in reaching the UK’s climate change targets. Right now, people want to know what they can do to help mitigate the effects of climate change.”In the past year, the climate crisis has shifted from 11th place to third place on the list of people’s concerns in WWF’s monthly public opinion poll, just behind the NHS and Brexit. This year has also seen high-profile global youth climate strikes and Extinction Rebellion protests. In addition, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2019 report stresses that it will be impossible to keep global temperatures at safe levels unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced in all sectors, including land and food. As a result, more people recognise that climate breakdown isn’t abstract. It’s not a threat affecting remote communities, or far away in the distant future – it’s happening here and now.The climate and nature crisis is already accelerating so many human-induced influences on our planet – from the destruction of vast areas of rainforest in the Amazon to the collapse of bee populations. As more species become endangered, including one-third of all insects globally, the ecosystems that we all rely on become more fragile.With such astonishing loss of bioersity and habitat, planet Earth is much more likely to reach irreversible tipping points. Environmental breakdown is inevitable if we continue this unsustainable consumption of fossil fuels.Mark Wright, WWF’s director of science, hopes that environmental issues will be at the top of the agenda for political leaders: “Attitudes are shifting and now we need a step-change – the UK government needs to take radical steps to meet its target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.”WWF climate experts estimate that net-zero could be achieved much sooner than the current 2050 target if we act now, but that calls for fundamental changes to the UK’s outdated energy infrastructure. Historically, the UK has been one of the biggest emitters and has an important role to fully decarbonise our energy system as quickly as possible. We need to make the energy greener and develop a more resilient smart system, as O’Dowd explains: “Our grid needs to be flexible so it can better manage supply and demand as we transition to more renewable energy. By equipping every home with a smart meter, power can be adjusted on a local and national level so the system is more energy efficient.”O’Dowd describes smart meters as “the enabler”, and they will undoubtedly be integral to the transition towards a low-carbon economy. To facilitate innovation, the government has pledged to offer every home and small business in the country a smart meter in the next few years – to date about 15.6m smart meters have been installed nationwide. “Smart meters allow consumers to understand their own energy use, and, with information from the in-home display, customers can start making small, money-saving changes such as switching off appliances which aren’t in use.”The government estimates that £650m of energy gets wasted in the current distribution system, travelling from where it is generated to the point it reaches our homes. Smart meters can help reduce loss in energy by accurately forecasting demand and using more low-cost and renewable energy. “We need to ramp up our wind power and solar generation in order to reach our 2050 target of net-zero, but these renewables don’t have an easy route to market,” says O’Dowd. “We want to push the government to raise its ambition – we know the technology exists and solutions are there but we need government support and its investment in our grid network to help that transition.”Ultimately, a smart energy system will generate, distribute and use energy much more efficiently. At a national network level, a more flexible infrastructure will use energy storage, for example via batteries or heating, and will shift demand away from peak periods, because when demand is highest, more of the electricity we consume is generated by polluting coal stations.In conjunction with the University of Oxford, Environmental Defense Fund Europe, and WWF, the National Grid has created a carbon intensity forecast that predicts the generation mix for the next four days in each region of the country. Energy users can enter their postcode and find out when the best time is to access green, clean energy. If your washing machine has a timer, you can set it to run at night, for example, when demand is low and more of the system’s energy is generated by renewables. In homes with solar panels, it might make sense to use electricity at midday if the sun is shining.As the smart energy system becomes more interactive with advanced technology, smart meters will play a part in allowing the shift to more staggered night-time charging for electric car batteries to minimise carbon emissions and keep costs down. In the future, this management could become automatic, with more widespread “time-of-use” tariffs. Local peer-to-peer trading could become more commonplace so consumers could more easily trade the excess energy they generate from solar panels. And perhaps the carbon intensity forecast might one day be reported alongside the weather.The Committee on Climate Change states that to reach our 2050 net-zero emissions target, we must reduce our carbon emissions by 15m tonnes a year, every year, starting now. “We’re in a rapidly changing world in terms of bioersity loss, habitat destruction and climate change, so we’re heading into uncharted territory,” says Wright. “We are clever and technologically savvy, so we may be able to cope with what the world throws at us in the future, but is that a world we want?” he asks, adding that as the climate changes, we’ll need to adapt quickly.For WWF, adopting smart meters is just one of the small changes we can each make, that our power companies do for us, that will help the overall system. It adds that smart meters help us to make changes to our power use – at a national, regional and domestic level – in ways that help cut emissions, which we need to do rapidly and deeply if we are to tackle the climate emergency.Wright says: “To feed the growing population in a world with more extreme weather events, increased flooding and rising sea temperatures, we’ll have to farm crops differently – we might need to start growing novel varieties of crops that are better suited to the environments of the future.” In order to have this capacity to adapt, we need to protect bioersity, on land and in the sea – every species plays a vital role in these ecosystems.“Nature rewards the patient – every species has a story to tell, even little beetles and velvet worms. If you allow nature to tell you its stories, you’ll unravel a real tapestry of life. We will be poorer if we continue to unpick that.”Part of Britain’s commitment to creating a more sustainable, low-carbon future includes making our energy network “smarter” – implementing digital tech to make our energy system more responsive to increased demand and variable wind speed. By collecting data on our energy use through smart meters, our network can better understand, plan for and balance out peaks and troughs in demand, making it easier to integrate renewable energy sources.This article was paid for by Smart Energy GB, a government-backed organisation tasked with informing Great Britain about the smart meter rollout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb048bba3607e286efdc52107924de3f3643b73c/0_365_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98f7d97a4030b6d96f509620339f2c38","title":"chameleon cushions and hydroponic gardens welcome to the smart home of the future","story":"In little more than a decade our homes could look very different. Daniel Robson explores how the future is closer than we think The concept reads like the set-design notes for a Star Trek movie: home furnishings that change colour and shape according to your mood, modular rooms that can be added to your home, and bathrooms that can track your health statistics. But the era of the smart eco-home may actually be closer than you think.Futurologists and energy experts say that by 2030, we could be able to use existing reconfigurable materials and augmented reality to change the shape of our furniture, for example changing a brown leather sofa into a plush red velvet one, simply by commanding our in-home AI system. Smart cushions will change colour like chameleons to suit your mood. Bed covers will adapt to your body temperature for maximum snuggling.Innovations are afoot in the kitchen, too. Hydroponic gardens are already a reality, used in a growing number of restaurants around the world and even in branches of Veggie Pret – but by 2030 we may have these at home. Hydroponics uses LED lights to grow vegetables without soil in a compact space, and to keep them fresh for longer. And smart appliances such as kettles and toasters will store energy during off-peak times, so that they are cheaper to use when you actually need them. For now, though, we have smart meters and not only are they making us more energy efficient, they are going to be a main player in reaching the UK’s 2050 emissions target.Meanwhile, smart bathrooms may help to improve efficiency by generating power from toilet and shower wastewater, or even filtering it to make the home water self-sufficient.Buildings will be made from recycled materials, with improved insulation and solar panels on the rooftops and even in the windows. Modular rooms can be added as your family grows and then removed again when the kids leave home, allowing a more controlled usage of the energy supply. Sensors could track residents around the house, adjusting the temperature and lighting in each room accordingly.At the heart of this system are smart meters. Already available at no additional cost across Britain from your energy supplier, these gadgets monitor household energy use throughout the day and report data back to network operators, which helps to predict demand and generate the supply accordingly. They also tell users when electricity rates are cheapest, for more cost-efficient use.“A smart energy system makes it easier for us to draw on and store electricity when it’s less in demand, and then use it again when scarce or more expensive later in the day,” says Robert Cheesewright, director of corporate affairs, Smart Energy GB. “Together, smart meters and a smart energy system help to create a cleaner, greener Britain.”There are already 15.6m smart meters installed in homes and businesses across Britain, and these devices not only make efficient energy use easy through visibility of consumption, they also display your near-real time costs in pounds and pence so that you can keep in better control of your spending.Stepping further into sci-fi utopia, smart meters can help to unlock the possibility of a shared electricity system for each local community, taking advantage of shared renewable energy sources such as solar panels and wind farms, and powering things like a communal electric car pool as a convenient yet eco-friendly alternative to public transport.Electric car ownership is likely to rise anyway, as new government legislation will soon make it compulsory for all new-build homes with a dedicated parking space to include a charging point. With the help of a smart meter and a smart charger, cars will charge during off-peak hours, reducing the cost of fuel to as little as 3p per mile – compared with 11p for petrol and diesel cars.“There might even be instances where you could get paid to charge your car when the power system needs us to use more power,” said futurologist Dr Ian Pearson, during a panel discussion hosted by Smart Energy GB.With fossil fuels, it is easy for the energy companies to control the supply – when more power is needed, they just burn more coal. But renewable energy does not work this way: sun and wind power dictate their own routines.The best part is, you won’t even have to think about it. Once the system is set up, the smart meter, alongside your smart appliances, chargers and services will do all the work, managing your supply automatically according to your preferences. And the addition of batteries will make it possible to store power in the home.Saving energy, saving money, saving the environment. Smart eco-homes (and the smart meters that enable them) will become an integral part of a greener Britain – and the future could be with us in less than a decade.Part of Britain’s commitment to creating a more sustainable, low-carbon future includes making our energy network “smarter” – implementing digital tech to make our energy system more responsive to increased demand and variable wind speed.

There wouldn’t be much made from plastic, because if the plastic gets in the rivers it kills the animals.If you do really good things the house will see it and say good things about you because you’re helping the environment. It might say bad stuff if you ruin the environment, or it won’t speak to you.I would like that to happen – it’d be very nice for the house to look and speak to you because it’ll make you feel happy.My house would be medium-sized and you wouldn’t need keys, it would open if I put my hand on the door, but if a stranger put their hand on it, it wouldn’t open. It would know if people coming to the house were good or bad and would only let good people in.It wouldn’t have loads of food because it’s bad for the environment to waste it.

We’ll still have our pet cats, but if other animals have lost their habitats then they can come and live with us as well. There’ll be a sliding door to the garden where we keep our bikes and also grow tomatoes, cucumbers and pomegranates.In the winter, all the inside walls will be covered in sheep’s wool so the house will be all cosy, like the inside of a slipper. We’ll have small windows and very big windows because it’s nice to have lots of sun, but not when you’re asleep. In the summer we’ll have a street party where no one will smoke or use plastic.Arianna Burke, nine: ‘A robot will sense when you’re wasting energy’I believe environmentally friendly homes of the future will have light switches that switch off in an hour or two when no one is inside.I think there would also be some sort of robot that senses if devices like the TV are on and knows whether people are there or not, and if not, it switches them off. I also think all houses should have solar panels on them automatically when they are built.Rai Rodell, nine: ‘I’ll collect rainwater for animals to drink’I’m going to have lots of animals in my house and in my garden. I’m going to grow food in the garden for me and my animals, and some seeds for the birds. I’ll put bird boxes on the roof so they have somewhere to live.The balcony will shelter the outdoor animals when it rains.

We have also taken robust action against operators who fail to protect consumers and we will be even tougher if behaviour does not change.”The report does not say how many of those gamblers fall under the at risk category, one level below the generally accepted problem gambling classification, but it is likely to be a much larger percentage based on previous data.One section of the report highlights a concern that algorithms used by gambling companies to track betting patterns are far better at identifying people who might be worth granting VIP status to than they are at spotting problem gamblers.In a section considering how to react to the information about VIPs, the regulator suggests several options. They include investigating how VIP staff at gambling companies are incentivised putting pressure on operators to draw up an industry-wide VIP code of conduct and limiting incentives on offer to scheme members. The document also lays out the option to ban VIP status.The Labour MP Carolyn Harris, who chairs a cross-party parliamentary group on gambling, said: “This report shows how completely reliant the industry is on people with gambling problems and that they are profiteering from them.“As the Gambling Commission has itself suggested these practices should be banned to protect problem gamblers and stop the transfer of money from vulnerable addicted gamblers directly into the pockets of the online gambling industry.”Gamblers are typically offered VIP status after losing large amounts of money with one company, which has an interest in retaining them as a customer rather than see them bet with a rival instead.VIPs are often assigned a specialist account manager, who has authorisation to offer perks such as free bets and cashback on losing wagers. In some cases, free gifts including tickets to sports events and even flights are offered.Last year, the  revealed Ladbrokes had agreed to pay £1m to the victims of a VIP problem gambler who had stolen the money he was using to bet, in return for a pledge not to inform the industry regulator.The bookmaker showered the gambling addict with thousands of pounds worth of gifts over two years, including free tickets to football matches and business class flights. VIP schemes have also been mentioned in a succession of regulatory punishments handed down by the Gambling Commission. Last year, Betfair was criticised for helping a VIP hide his gambling from his wife.Brigid Simmonds, chair of the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC) trade body, said: “Our industry recognises the need to change practices in this area and we will soon publish the terms of a review for a new industry code of conduct. We intend to consult widely on the shape of this new code, to ensure we are always putting the welfare of our customers first.”The BGC launched last year as the industry faced the threat of further regulation after the crackdown on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs).The stock market value of UK gambling companies plunged by more than £1bn earlier this year after a report by MPs recommended much tighter controls on online gambling, including restrictions on VIP schemes.The report also called for a £2 stake limit on casino-style slots games, matching the restrictions imposed on FOBTs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a2a82bd2f7acbc42ff06f7a9b867e9d26dc65d2/0_38_3134_1881/master/3134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a313e1a83622d0ca4897bd4767c9e819","title":"buffalos ageless frank gore the bell cow back whos doing the impossible","story":"Today’s pass-first NFL claims to have no place for a lunch-bucket grinder like Gore and yet he abides, quietly scaling the record book as the Bills aim for a first playoff win in 24 yearsA great running back has a career that’s easily reduced to a 10-second highlight. For Cleveland’s Jim Brown, it’s a black-and-white montage of him barreling through wall after wall of humanity to paydirt. For Chicago’s Walter Payton, we smash-cut from Sweetness sloughing off would-be tacklers like George Costanza fleeing a smoking kids’ party to Sweetness dolphin-ing over a stacked front onto a concrete end zone. For Detroit’s Barry Sanders, roll that clip from the 1992 playoffs of him going all Great Tiger on the eventual Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys.As for the Buffalo Bills’ Frank Gore? Well, his greatness isn’t easily GIF’d. Look up the five-time Pro Bowler’s highlights on YouTube, and, sure, the hits – mostly of him jetting through scrums in his younger days and piling up yards after contact now – aren’t bad. It’s just not the kind of mental time-capsule fodder that autoplays at the very mention of his name.Nevertheless: all of Gore’s efforts, however pedestrian they might seem in comparison to those monumental rushers, added up to something quite spectacular just the same. With a 65-yard afternoon against Denver on 24 November, Gore slipped past Sanders into third place on the NFL’s all-time rushing list 26 more yards in Buffalo’s season-finale against the New York Jets last Sunday left Gore with a staggering 15,347 yards for his career, a running total that now only trails those of Payton (16,726) and Cowboys icon Emmitt Smith (18,355). Throw in Gore’s 3,896 yards receiving, and he becomes the only runner other than Payton to amass more than 15,000 yards on the ground and more than 3,500 through the air.All this in what was a down year for the 5ft 9in, 212lb Gore, one that saw him register career lows in total yards (599) and yards per carry (3.6). Still: there’s no doubt his modest contributions and leadership behind the scenes are a big reason why the Bills are back in the playoffs for the second time in three seasons. (And all this after an 18-year drought, once the longest in North American pro sports.) On Saturday they’ll pit their top-10 rushing attack against the Houston Texans’ bottom-10 rush defense and play for a wild-card upset on the road.That Gore should feature prominently in these epic milestones – and not, say, former Chiefs dynamo Jamaal Charles or former Titans dazzler Chris Johnson or former St. Louis Ram bruiser Steven Jackson – beggars belief. Consider: this is a 36-year-old dude playing on his third team in five seasons, after spending the first decade of his career in San Francisco. By rights, Gore should be opening up a restaurant or settling into an analyst gig or home getting his college-bound son, Frank Gore Jr, ready for his own running back career instead wintering in Buffalo in preparation for his first playoff appearance in six years.What’s more, pro football isn’t just a pass-first league now it’s a pass early and often league. The modern game claims to have no place for a bell-cow back with Gore’s bona fides. And yet this dude abides. With each new handoff, he lowers his shoulders and steams ahead, face mask jutting out like a cowcatcher, yards piling up all the while. His silent protest of the NFL’s pass wacky era alone should mark him as a gridiron wizard. Yet when a jury of football druids compiled a list of the NFL’s best 100 players ever for the occasion of the league’s centennial, Gore’s name was nowhere to be found on a running back roster that included Brown, Payton, Sanders and Smith.On the one hand that figures. Gore has yet to win a Super Bowl, falling a goal line stand short when the Colin Kaepernick-led San Francisco 49ers faced the Baltimore Ravens in 2013 despite rushing for a game-high 110 yards on 19 carries. Gore also has never finished better than third on the single-season rushing yardage list and isn’t likely to improve in that area as opportunities diminish with age. Worst of all, his style is so unassuming. He’s not much of a first-down celebrator or an end-zone dancer. Strip away the stakes, and the carry on which he pipped Sanders – a fourth-quarter burst through the teeth of the Broncos line that went for seven yards – becomes about as exciting as the sight of Sanders calmly handing the ball off to an official after one of his unreal touchdown scampers. Call him “Frank Bore”.Gore was no less determined after leaving San Francisco to sign with Indianapolis, or after leaving Indy for Miami three years later. And though he continued to lead those teams in rushing even as his efficiency tapered, Gore failed in his quest to return to the heights he had reached in San Francisco. Last March he started over again in Buffalo, signing a one-year deal for $2m to share a backfield with fellow Pro Bowler LeSean McCoy. Five months later the Bills cut McCoy loose, leaving Gore to serve as a mentor to rookie running back Devin Singletary and second-year quarterback Josh Allen – a Gore jersey owner in his youth, as it happens. Together, they are the heart of the most rugged playoff offense outside of Nashville and the most exciting Bills offense since Flutiemania. Which is to say: perhaps this right here is the signature Gore highlight we’ve been waiting for.And while his particular strain of genius might not be so obvious, this much is clear: game recognizes game. After the historic Denver game, Gore was pressed by the Broncos fearsome pass rusher Von Miller for his game-worn jersey and, later, blitzed with video messages from Sanders, Smith and his son among other prominent well-wishers. To a man, they encouraged Gore to keep going – with McGahee pushing his Miami teammate not to stop until he reaches the top of the all-time rushing list. And, shoot, if Tom Brady can break records in his 40s, there’s little reason to believe Gore can’t as if he stays healthy and keeps having fun, and teams can still find use for him. The only question is whether he can do it in a Buffalo uniform.That said: it’s not a question that the Bills’ table-slamming faithful figure to be asking this week, as they urge Gore on in hopes witnessing the team’s first postseason victory since 1995. Another running back might shudder under that kind of pressure. But, clearly, Gore thrives under pressure. He just has a funny way of showing it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a84c45a8557a3660432a0ae012fcacc4901de77/0_118_4903_2942/master/4903.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9969a852f03f1074ac2c07efd3b31d9a","title":"england rory burns ankle injury before second test south africa","story":"Ben Stokes revealed this week that England’s players are calling their assignment in South Africa “the cursed tour” and yet more evidence that is the case presented itself on Thursday when Rory Burns was ruled out of the rest of the series after injuring an ankle during a game of football on the eve of the second Test.The news, which leaves a sizeable hole at the top of England’s batting order, came soon after it emerged Jofra Archer is all but certain to miss this Cape Town Test with an elbow injury that flared up on New Year’s Day. Unlike Burns, who will return home for treatment on the left ankle that has sustained ligament damage, it is hoped Archer will be fit for the final two Tests of the four-match series.England are 1-0 down after their opening 107-run defeat at Centurion and will now be without their leading run-scorer and wicket-taker from that match when the second Test starts at Newlands on Friday morning.Burns was one of the few players not struck down with sickness that affected 17 members of the touring party over the Christmas period. Yet his freak tour-ending injury during a game of football – a completely avoidable scenario – has only increased the sense of fatalism surrounding the England camp.Burns landed awkwardly on his left ankle in the follow-through from a shot that saw him score despite the close attention of Joe Root. However, not even VAR could apportion any blame to England’s captain during the incident that saw Burns roll his ankle before being treated by the team doctor, Anita Biswas, and helped from the field.An England statement, released after Burns had a scan, said: “Rory Burns has sustained ligament damage to his left ankle. He has been ruled out of the remainder of the South Africa Test series and will return home for further assessment and treatment at the earliest convenience.”It means Zak Crawley, the 21-year-old opener who made his Test debut at No 6 against New Zealand in Hamilton in late November, is likely to partner Dom Sibley at the top of the order for the remainder of the series.The immediate fallout from Burns’s injury will see England ban the squad from playing football. Ashley Giles, the England director of cricket who arrives in Port Elizabeth next week before the third Test, called for football to be banned when he took on the role a year ago. Giles said it put players at undue risk of injury but, after talks with Root, did not ban the matches because of their popularity with the squad. That was despite Jonny Bairstow missing several weeks of last winter’s tour of Sri Lanka after also injuring an ankle playing football before the fourth ODI in Pallekele. Now it seems practicality has been prioritised over popularity.The fitness problem with Archer, England’s quickest bowler, is also a worry. The 24-year-old did not train on Thursday and England were awaiting the results of a scan before officially ruling him out.Root indicated a bowler who has played 22 games for England since making his debut last May would not be risked. He said: “I think it’s a recurring injury. That is something you want to manage in a young talent like Jofra, making sure we don’t blow him out for six months and make sure we get the most out of him for as long as we can.”Root confirmed the fast bowler Mark Wood and the Somerset spinner Jack Leach were not fit enough to be considered. With a dry pitch at Newlands, it appeared certain Dom Bess, who played two Tests against Pakistan in 2018, would come into the side. Ollie Pope, the Surrey batsman who missed the first Test after being struck down with the virus that swept through the England camp, was also expected to come into the XI for Bairstow.As for talk of the “cursed” tour, Root, speaking before Burns’s injury, admitted: “It’s been frustrating throughout but these things happen in sport. You’ve got to manage them as best you can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/108948806e8b6d08c6282b8479efec5358fe6700/0_109_2503_1502/master/2503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=196cd0ecc11191ef49a0e123694a4677","title":"australia v new zealand third test day one live","story":"Todd Astle bowling in wraparound shades appreciation post.One obvious benefit of New Zealand fielding two spinners is the over-rate. We’re already 58-overs deep into the day, meaning we’re only two behind schedule, meaning we may get close to hitting the scheduled 5.30pm close of play. Another session to Australia. they might have lost David Warner just after lunch, and Steve Smith might have taken an age to get off the mark, but the runs are now flowing on a docile pitch against a popgun attack. Tim Paine is probably already sizing up the weather (and air quality) forecast and preparing declaration strategies. 58th over: Australia 182-2 (Labuschagne 73, Smith 42) Nice over from Astle, first landing his wrong ‘un then beating Smith with his flight, drawing a mistimed drive. 57th over: Australia 180-2 (Labuschagne 72, Smith 41) Somerville is now coming around the wicket to the right-handers, asking a slightly different question of first Labuschagne, then Smith. The former looks a tad uneasy until he rotates the strike, allowing Smith to use his feet and clip a couple to midwicket.James Hannan has joined in the conversation about Neil Wagner. “As to the current furore (if it can be called that) over Wagner’s bouncer barrage, I think most people are forgetting Australia are two up in the series and have posted large totals in each of their first digs. The problem isn’t Wagner, it’s that he’s had no support. The man is pure phenomenon and we need more like him. Did anyone see the push ups he did at the top of his mark in 40 degree heat in Perth, just before he ran in for another over?” You won’t find Adam or I disagreeing with you James. 56th over: Australia 177-2 (Labuschagne 71, Smith 39) Astle is bowling in some crisp 90s-looking wraparound shades that give him the feel of Mark Waugh rolling his arm over in grade cricket. They don’t help him when he drops too short and wide, allowing Smith to calmly guide a four behind point. 55th over: Australia 171-2 (Labuschagne 70, Smith 34) Spin from both ends again with Will Somerville back into the attack. His stump-to-stump offies are worked into the on-side for three singles and a three as Australia continue their serene progress. 54th over: Australia 165-2 (Labuschagne 68, Smith 30) Todd Astle’s leg-spin is called upon once more. Smith is patient with the ones that land on a good length, but he kicks himself for missing out on the long-hop that he slaps straight to the ring fielder. A maiden is there for the taking but Astle can’t join the dots, offering a hint of width from ball six that Smith steers down to third-man. 53rd over: Australia 163-2 (Labuschagne 68, Smith 28) Henry keeps Smith honest in an over that goes for just the one single. “Not sure I would be overstating the use of umpires with regards to Wagner,” emails Peter Warrington. “As far they are concerned there is no such thing as intimidatory bowling, not even the ball that Cummins cleaned Anderson up with in Perth a couple if summers ago. Or the alleged Beamer of J Archer. Seems umps think people wanna see the quicks go at it?”. That’s up to them, and the ICC to decide. In the meantime Wagner is free to bowl in his current manner, which is creatively solving a problem that has tormented the very best bowlers for years. 52nd over: Australia 162-2 (Labuschagne 68, Smith 27) CdG’s gentle medium pace goes for two this over. It’s a glorified net for these two Australians at the moment, and that net is one of the middle ones, used by bowlers sharpening-up for the second or third XIs. 51st over: Australia 160-2 (Labuschagne 67, Smith 26) Oooh, that mistake New Zealand are desperate for almost arrived. Labuschagne drove loosely outside off, releasing his bottom hand from the bat in the process, but the resulting edge flies harmlessly through the gap where a third or fourth slip might have been stationed. The four runs from that streaky effort sit alongside four singles and a two in the scorebook documenting a dot-less over for Matt Henry. 50th over: Australia 150-2 (Labuschagne 61, Smith 22) CdG’s recall ends the experiment with spin for now, just as Australia were getting on top of both Astle and Somerville. De Grandhomme goes for three easy singles in an innocuous over. The match is now in a very one-sided passage with Australia scoring runs with the minimum of fuss and New Zealand looking unable to do anything about it. 49th over: Australia 147-2 (Labuschagne 60, Smith 20) Just the single to Smith from Henry’s latest over. 48th over: Australia 146-2 (Labuschagne 60, Smith 19) If Australia were becalmed in the hour after lunch they’re going through the gears now. Labuschagne takes Somerville high over midwicket for six, then clips another effortless two to move into the 60s. On this surface, with this attack, it’s going to take an error of judgement from one of these run-hungry batsmen to generate a breakthrough. 47th over: Australia 138-2 (Labuschagne 52, Smith 19) Matt Henry’s back for a burst to disrupt the rhythm of spin from both ends, and he almost jags Smith with a leg-glance that flies just wide of the ing leg-gully. 46th over: Australia 135-2 (Labuschagne 51, Smith 17) Somerville, like Astle, has landed his spinners extremely well, offering New Zealand good control .But this is a first day pitch so there are no demons and the slow turn is easy to see onto the face of the bat for batsmen of this class. One of those batsmen is Marnus Labuschagne, who reaches 50 for the sixth time in seven innings this summer with a push into the off-side that some good running turns into three runs. Smith then gets in on the act by cutting another four after engineering some width by dropping deep in his crease. Raf from Melbourne has taken the contrarian position on the excellent bowling of Neil Wagner. “When you say Wagner cannot be faulted, is it ok if we fault him for only having such good figures because he’s being allowed to flagrantly break the laws of cricket on number of bouncers an over and on negative leg side bowling? He is doing a tremendous job of maintaining accuracy over long spells of this awful tactic, no doubt, but if he’s allowed to keep doing it we’re going to see every team in world cricket doing this and Tests turn into slow-scoring borefests. There’s a reason that limited over cricket has even harsher restrictions on bowling like this, but Test cricket has rules against it too. I’m impressed by bowlers who beat batsmen by bowling within the laws. I’m not impressed with this whole Wagner love-in when his whole tactic is to just bowl in a way that is so artificially difficult to hit that it would trigger instant wide calls in limited over cricket, until the batsmen get bored and frustrated.”It’s almost as though we need some independent arbiters out there to determine if Wagner is breaking any laws. What’s that? Oh, right...45th over: Australia 128-2 (Labuschagne 48, Smith 13) Astle continues, but his seventh over contains a rare long-hop that Smith does not miss out on, slashing through cover for four. 44th over: Australia 123-2 (Labuschagne 47, Smith 9) Smith is easing into his work now, regularly finding that single just behind square on the leg-side to keep the partnership ticking along. With spin from both ends Smith is now batting in his baggy green, which will delight the felt fetishists out there. Labuschagne retains his lid, which, as long retired junior scorer, I appreciate, for distinguishing the two right-handed batsmen out in the middle. Thank you very much Adam. Remember to retune your emails and tweets to the following addresses: @JPHowcroft and jonathan.howcroft.casual@the. 43rd over: Australia 121-2 (Labuschagne 46, Smith 8) Appropriately, it is Todd Astle for the final over of this third hour and my stint on the OBO today. Labuschagne collects a couple early in the over through midwicket before playing the rest with respect. As he should. This man commands respect. On that note, I’m handing over to JP Howcroft with drinks on the field. Talk tomorrow! 42nd over: Australia 119-2 (Labuschagne 44, Smith 8) Right, Will Somerville is back for his first go of the middle session and is immediately spinning a long way back at Labuschagne, beating his inside edge. There’s an appeal for leg before but not a convincing one. When Smith gets his chance he gets down the track to time it beautifully through midwicket for his first boundary. He miscues in defence to finish but the task is changing for New Zealand here. They have to stay patient.Samson yet again: the most number of balls faced without scoring, then converted into a ton, was 37 when Colin Cowdrey went on with it against India in 1964.40th over: Australia 114-2 (Labuschagne 43, Smith 4) Astle, the absolute boy, goes again. Smith, far more comfortable in his skin now, comes down the track to whip two to start the over. That’s the guy we know. He plays the rest out carefully. How about Andrew Samson on SEN? “39 balls to get off the mark is the most by an Australian since David Boon against the West Indies in the Port of Spain in 1991.” Firstly, I remember that. But more importantly, how does he find such a thing?40th over: Australia 112-2 (Labuschagne 43, Smith 2) As Smith struggles, his little mate continues to take singles when he pleases, putting the former captain back on strike straight away. And he get off the mark with one around the corner! It took him 39 balls to do so, would you believe it. The SCG crowd go up as though he’s brought up a century - very good from them. Smith can laugh at it too, putting his hand in the air to acknowledge the reception as Wagner pats him on the back. A replay shows that Labuschagne, who was heading to the danger end, only just made his ground with a e when the ball past the stumps. Later in the over he takes another to deep backward square and the crowd are up with him again. 39th over: Australia 108-2 (Labuschagne 41, Smith 0) The madness continues, Smith failing to take a single when it is there after deflecting from short leg, then clipping a short ball straight into the fielder in that position. He leaves a big-turning leggie to finish. Excellent work, TODDY ASTLE! 38 dots for Smith! 38th over: Australia 107-2 (Labuschagne 40, Smith 0) Wagner and Smith, what a couple of crazy cats! Smith is refusing to engage with the determined short attack from over the wicket. Not quite in the Wade manner - he’s using his bat. But with that comes risk too, the final ball prompting a chorus oooooh and aaaaahhh from behind the wicket as Smith tries and fails to get his first run behind square. The ball trickles away no more than a few metres from his glove. 33 dots now! Captivating! Wagner has figures of 12-6-15-1. He cannot be faulted. 37th over: Australia 107-2 (Labuschagne 40, Smith 0) I’m ALL IN on Todd Astle. In the best tradition of leggies, he’s almost all the way through a very tidy over at Labuschagne before giving him a BIG full toss to smash away. Performance art. 36th over: Australia 103-2 (Labuschagne 36, Smith 0) Wagner is clearly loving this, smiling each time Smith can’t get him away. 27 is the only number that matters here: the amount of dots the world’s best player has faced in a row. Remarkable. 35th over: Australia 102-2 (Labuschagne 35, Smith 0) Astle now with his throwback hairshadesaction - I’m well into his narrative. Smith gets five balls to work with here after Labuschagne gives him the strike with the first delivery bu the result is the same: 24 balls, yet to get off the mark! He’s furious when missing a long-hop too, picking out the man at point rather perfectly. This is good stuff.34th over: Australia 101-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 0) Wagner is less interested in the short stuff at Labuschagne, which is surprising given it worked in the second dig at Perth. He gets off strike with one to fine leg, giving Smith two balls to deal with from his nemesis. He does so, with soft hands. 19 balls, zero runs for Smith.33rd over: Australia 100-2 (Labuschagne 33, Smith 0) Labuschagne gives the strike back to Smith from the first ball of the new over, the former captain moving around more in the crease than usual to line up with de Grandhomme outside the off stump. He’s been out there for 15 balls without scoring, make that 16 - an inside edge that spits out to midwicket. And 17, when defending the final offering. 32nd over: Australia 99-2 (Labuschagne 32, Smith 0) Right, now it’s Wagner v Smith. Over the wicket to begin, bumping him right away - ducked. He’s into that awkward zone next up, on Smith’s hip, playing just behind square. That wasn’t a long way from the catcher at short leg. Another duck is required in response to the bouncer that follows right on the money. At the stumps, Smith defends with soft hands - good batting. “That’s the hard bit for Smith here,” says Simon Katich on SEN. “He gets so few balls to get forward to with so much short stuff that it’s not easy to get into the righ position.” He does to finish, Wagner - now from round the wicket - turned safely along the ground to leg gully. A maiden it is. Probing.31st over: Australia 99-2 (Labuschagne 32, Smith 0) Labuschagne plays a good de Grandhomme over watchfully, only getting out of his defensive posture in order to flick a couple out to midwicket when the chance presents. He’s in great nick. 30th over: Australia 97-2 (Labuschagne 30, Smith 0) Men still out for Labuschagne with Wagner at him but two conventional slips too. And that’s where he draws him into a false stroke, beating him outside the line of the off-stump. He didn’t need to play at it but the angle was so wide, he felt as though he needed to. With a single into the on side to finish, the Queenslander is into the 30s and keeps the strike.“Neil Wagner quite clearly takes the cake for being the gutsiest international bowler in the world,” writes Abhijato Sensarma. “He’s got the ranking he does in Test match cricket for a reason. His leg theory lines have proved to be the only tactic which has troubled the otherwise peerless Aussie batsmen so far. The length and frequency of his spells is unparalleled in my opinion. Salute to the most effective workhorse on this tour!” Too right.29th over: Australia 96-2 (Labuschagne 29, Smith 0) Labuschagne is straight back into accumulation mode, tucking de Grandhomme around the corner. Remarkable to think that Warner has an average of 6.5 against Wagner in the series, to whom he’s fallen four times. That’s the real quiz, which Smith returns to next over.28th over: Australia 95-2 (Labuschagne 28, Smith 0) Smith’s turn, who has fallen to Wagner’s short ball every time he’s been dismissed this series and he allows his first delivery out there to strike him on the stomach! “It’s a legitimate tactic,” says Simon Katich on SEN radio, pre-empting the usual whingeing. Well played, Neil Wagner. What a tour he’s had. The key question: can someone back him up?It works! He’s done it again! Wagner has the field spread for an error on the short ball and that’s what Warner has made, pulling straight to de Grandhomme at leg gully. That’s the fourth time he’s picked the opener up in the series. What a (re)start!The players are back on the field. Warner is on strike, resuming on 45. Wagner gets his second crack, setting the field immediately for the short stuff. PLAY! A reminder of those donationauction details. “G’day Adam.” Hi Murray Henman. “Has anyone (ICC  CA  SCG) issued any standards for whether  when the players should come off for smoke?”Good question. I heard Kevin Roberts before play making it clear that the players will come off as and when they need to with smoke - that’s been clear all week. I’ll take a look through the public comments if they’ve specified when that’d be.Australia’s session. It was always destined to be so after they won the chance to bat first at the toss. As I mentioned a couple of overs ago, the Black Caps bowled really well in the second half an hour to build pressure - a period that culiminated in de Grandhomme winning Burns’ outside edge to Taylor. As usual, Wagner was the catalyst of that tightening, Henry bowling nicely too. However, it fell away from the moment Labuschagne walked out to the middle, timing the ball immaculately from the outset. He and Warner have added 56 in 78 balls. 27th over: Australia 95-1 (Warner 45, Labuschagne 28) Spin from both ends before the break, Todd Astle on with his leggies - bowling in the shades! Very 1990s, as is his no-nonsense action after skipping to the crease. Like it. As does Warner, who is sweeping before the over is done, albeit straight to the man at backward square. “How good is it seeing two spinners on at the SCG before lunch on day one?” asks Kerry O on telly. Labuschagne defends two accurate leggies to finish. LUNCH! 26th over: Australia 93-1 (Warner 44, Labuschagne 27) Somerville is cut away off the back foot from Warner for two to begin the over, bringing up the 50 partnership between these two in just 67 balls. He’s on the back foot again from the next ball, time time slapping forward of point for three more. His length improves from there but it is another over going Australia’s way. After the Black Caps did so well in the second half an hour, culminating in the wicket of Joe Burns on the cusp of drinks, the hosts have dominated the rest of the session to date. There will probably be one more over before lunch, two if they rush. 25th over: Australia 87-1 (Warner 39, Labuschagne 26) Labuschagne is on one here, I reckon. The moment Henry strays ever so slightly to a middle and leg line, he’s onto it with a leg glance that skips away for four. There’s an element of risk associated with that stroke against a bowler like Henry who generates movement off the track, but you would never know it from the way it was executed.24th over: Australia 79-1 (Warner 37, Labuschagne 22) A lot to like about Somerville’s bouncing approach and high action, creating ample dip. He has a short leg but can’t get one quite in that zone to Labuschagne, who started the with a couple carved to deep point and finished sweeping two more to deep square.23rd over: Australia 75-1 (Warner 37, Labuschagne 18) Henry is back on the field and back into the attack. Labuschagne has to deal with one in the ribs early in the over and he works it away for a couple. Good batting. They finish the over with three easy singles in a row, which is a pretty bad sign for the Black Caps with quarter of an hour left on the clock until lunch on the opening day. 22nd over: Australia 70-1 (Warner 36, Labuschagne 14) This is a nice moment, Will Somerville into the attack for his first Test on what was his home ground for New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield until a couple of years ago. He’s straight on the mark to Labuschagne to begin, then Warner - his old teammate - to finish.21st over: Australia 69-1 (Warner 36, Labuschagne 13) “Rhythm is gone,” says Isa Guha of Colin de Grandhomme as Warner smashes him through cover once again. The all-rounder recovers well but the shape and bite from earlier has disappeared over the last couple of overs. I suspect it might be still to do with his footing.20th over: Australia 65-1 (Warner 32, Labuschagne 13) Wagner into his sixth over, Labuschagne showing the respect he deserves. A third maiden from him. 19th over: Australia 65-1 (Warner 32, Labuschagne 13) de Grandhomme is having a bit of an issue with his front foot, overstepping by a long way after looking down at where he should be landing. He’s sliding on arrival, the replay shows, which is never a good thing for a seamer’s confidence. Warner is all over a half-volley to finish, giving it the threatment through extra cover. This hasn’t been the opener’s most convincing morning at the office but he’s into the 30s and still standing.18th over: Australia 58-1 (Warner 26, Labuschagne 13) WARNER NEARLY OUT HOOKING! Wagner was spot on with his bumper, winning a fat top edge. Will Somerville was the man running in from long-leg in front of the members but he misjudged the approach, pulling out instead of ing. Should have made it to the contest, in footy speak. Urgh. Wagner is doing everything right, as usual."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaa04dd28321202651e9508bcf9cb940caa62859/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=249cf8188082773ff9d1f47f1657bc69","title":"broadway 2020 new plays musicals","story":"After another smash hit year at the box office, the next 12 months promises more of the same ... with added controversyThe lights are bright on Broadway. Blinding even. With 35 plays and musicals now running, Broadway looks likely to have grossed over $1bn in 2019, having played to more than 8 million people. National tours have become de rigueur for every musical that doesn’t absolutely flop and satellite productions pop up across the globe.But with big business comes big risk. Running costs remain steep. Most shows fail to recoup. A few New York not-for-profits (Roundabout, Manhattan Theatre Club, Second Stage, Lincoln Center Theater) have Broadway houses, yet even those companies rarely program shows without the reassurance of a well-known star or creator. Both the not-for-profits and the for-profits have been busily making wagers on which known quantities and out-of-town successes will attract New York audiences and the tourist trade. 2019 was fairly lively – Slave Play, What the Constitution Means to Me, Choir Boy, Freestyle Love Supreme, American Utopia, a recuperated Oklahoma!, Hadestown, Gary (a miss, but still a big swing). But looking ahead to 2020, most of those wagers appear conservative, probably too conservative. Subtract the star casting and only a few plays and musicals will generate much excitement.Of the musicals so far announced, six are new (or newish) and four are revivals. Two jukebox musicals are promised, one relatively innovative and one baffling. In Girl from the North Country, which had a successful run at the Public Theater two years ago, Conor McPherson transposes the songs of Bob Dylan to Depression-era Duluth. Why the playwright Lynn Nottage and the director and choreographer Christopher Wheeldon are charging ahead with MJ, a biomusical based around Michael Jackson, remains a mystery, but it seems telling that the production has revised its former title, the innuendo-available Don’t Stop ‘Til You Get Enough, with the more innocuous MJ.Queens, princesses, an unlikely drag act and an unlikelier acid trip inspire the other new musicals, such as Six, the hit London power-pop musical about the wives of Henry VIII. It joins Diana, with music by Joe DiPietro and David Bryan, a biomusical about the people’s princess. Following in the high-heeled footsteps of Tootsie comes Mrs Doubtfire, an adaptation of the Robin Williams movie about a orced dad who puts on a dress to get closer to his children. Perhaps the most original entry is Flying Over Sunset, a new musical with a book by James Lapine and music by Tom Kitt that details the mid-50s LSD experiments of Cary Grant, Clare Booth Luce and Aldous Huxley.If that doesn’t sound like enough of a trip, Katrina Lenk, a Tony winner for The Band’s Visit, will star in Marianne Elliott’s gender-flipped Company, and Hugh Jackman, that great showman, will lead a revival of The Music Man. Ivo van Hove returns the Sharks and the Jets to the stage in a new version of West Side Story, with choreography by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker. Sharon D Clarke will reprise the title role in Caroline, or Change, in Michael Longhurst’s celebrated revival of Tony Kushner and Jeanine Tesori’s underrated blues and klezmer musical.It’s difficult to discern much of a melody in the varied roster of new plays. Two of them, Martin McDonagh’s Hangmen, now starring Dan Stevens, and Stefano Massini’s The Lehman Trilogy, with Simon Russell Beale, arrive after successful runs both in London and Off-Broadway. Two solo shows chronicle the stages of a woman’s life, Elizabeth Strout’s My Name is Lucy Barton, adapted by Rona Munro and starring Laura Linney, and Noah Haidle’s Birthday Candles, starring Debra Messing. Grand Horizons, the Broadway debut of the celebrated off-Broadway writer Bess Wohl, centers on a golden-years orce. The not-so-happy couple: Jane Alexander and James Cromwell. Tracy Letts, who brought Linda Vista to Broadway in 2019, returns with The Minutes, in which he also stars, alongside Armie Hammer and Jesse Mueller. Directed by Steppenwolf’s Anna D Shapiro, it charts a town council meeting in real time.When it comes to play revivals, producers have stuck to American properties, all of them penned in the last 60 years. It hasn’t been long since Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf and American Buffalo were on Broadway. But here they are again, with Laurie Metcalf (who can never, it seems, not be on Broadway), Rupert Everett, and Russell Tovey attached to the former and Laurence Fishburne and Sam Rockwell to the latter. (One might have anticipated that after Bitter Wheat, the theater might want a David Mamet breather. Not so much.) Paula Vogel’s How I Learned to Drive was recently revived off-Broadway, but it has its keys in the ignition again, this time with its original stars, Mary-Louise Parker and David Morse, attached.Star casting will also gin up anticipation for Kenny Leon’s revival of Charles Fuller’s wrenching drama A Soldier’s Play, now starring David Alan Grier and Blair Underwood, and Richard Greenberg’s comedy-drama of baseball and sexuality, Take Me Out, with Jesse Williams and Jesse Tyler Ferguson. Husband-and-wife Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker star in Neil Simon’s Plaza Suite, playing two couples and one near couple, all occupying the same hotel room.Want to place bets on which shows will still be running this time next year?

No need telling that to a crowd of bleary-eyed parents and carers, with their own squawking chicks in tow, for this adaptation of Emma Dodd’s popular book.The Little Angel puppet theatre does a reliably fun festive show – I have fond memories of the chatty stockings waiting to be filled in 2013’s The Night Before Christmas (“Hope there’s a satsuma!”). First put on in 2016, Samantha Lane’s production Me … now has a run in its studio space. Children sprawl on soft mats before a stage that is framed by designer Simon Plumridge with slabs of cracked ice.Dodd’s chick’s-eye-view tale about an overwhelming world is told with gentle rhythms and reassuring repetition. It’s a comforting book that ends with a practically mandatory hug from whoever reads it. A folksy opening song by Arran Glass interweaves familiar lines from the story as we watch a chick hatch at the feet of an emperor penguin, with a puppet controlled in each hand by Lori Hopkins. Jimmy Grimes’s designs are appealing: the big penguins have the right shimmering grace, while the fluffy baby has the same look as a plush cuddly toy. The rest of the colony are suggested by a cacophony of cries that puzzlingly morph into Prokofiev’s Romeo and Juliet.While Dodd’s tale is for over-ones, this production is for children aged two to five. There are several attempted stage invasions from the toddlers, but I suspect older kids’ attentions may wander during the penguin’s waddling odyssey through wind and water. Partly that’s because the 40-minute production has the same anonymous quality as the book – there is nothing particularly distinctive about this chick – but also because there’s no wow moment and no belly laughs. Still, it’s a sweet, breezy show to brighten up that long winter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/380ce81691f799d2909f8afba2ecc1dccafa1523/0_335_5022_3012/master/5022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=303ab0e9221717a33abef69f519bf703","title":"winter walks uk pubs cafes reader suggestions","story":"Hundreds of you commented on our recent winter walks feature, adding your own great hikes. So we’ve selected 10 of your favourites, from Scottish beaches to Hampshire hillsBest walk for us: start in Thorpe Bay, on the eastern side of Southend and walk all along the coast to Leigh-on-Sea (about five miles). Stop for a warming drink in any of the pubs (Ye Olde Smack or the Peterboat perhaps), or have fish and chips made with locally sourced fish, then return. You could make a longer route by walking Southend pier, the longest in the world – a mile out and a mile back: the seascapes are stunning at this time of year.BabylonianSheDevilWalk from the War Memorial out of Ilmington up Grump Street and Tinkers Lane. Right at the first gate after the houses, down through the field and left after the next gate. Over the hill, right down the lane all the way till you pass the lodge on the right, then right through the gap in the fence, across the field, stop for the hot drink you’ve brought with you. Through the gate, right at the top, right again down Campden Pitch to the path on the right, left at the end of that path and then drop down through the fields where you started. Grab a quick drink and a bag of crisps at the Howard Arms and then home – you’ve had one of the best afternoons you can imagine.Nigel PerryWe love to walk on Holkham beach, north Norfolk, in the winter. It’s beautiful, virtually deserted (unlike in summer) and there are lots of interesting migratory birds to see, including the rare shore lark. You can do a circular walk from Wells-next-the-Sea through the pinewoods behind the dunes and then back along the beach, or vice versa (around 5½ miles in total), or if you get too cold or tired there’s always the Coastliner bus to get you back to your starting point. There’s a cafe at Holkham Bay for hot drinks and snacks, or the Victoria Inn for good pub food.• holkhamSweetjane1957Ten years ago, we took a walk from our home on the mainland side of Portsmouth over Portsdown Hill, aiming for the Golden Lion pub-restaurant in the village of Southwick. There was deep snow (for the south of England), and although we had a map, it wasn’t a lot of use as the tracks were totally covered. What the heck - we struck out anyway, and it was beautiful. We found our way down the far side of the hill (on later walks when the snow had cleared, we discovered we had more or less followed Crooked Walk Lane) and did indeed reach Southwick. We were the only customers in the pub, and lunch was off because the chef hadn’t made it in, but the landlord served us coffee. It’s a favourite pub hike for us now.Eternally HopefulThere are lots of walking opportunities in beautiful Angus, including the glens, and also some coastal walks, with beaches at Montrose, St Cyrus, Lunan Bay, Elliot and Monifieth. Try the amazing coastal cliff walk from Arbroath to Auchmithie before visiting the shingle beach that appears in the 2013 Scarlett Johansson film Under The Skin. Or join the monthly Hospitalfields heritage walks, including the Steading, North Lodge and the Mortuary Chapel.Julie AdamsI’d like to suggest the magnificent cliff walk between Sandyhills and Kippford, via Rockcliffe (about five miles, three to four hours) in Dumfries and Galloway. There’s parkinga bus terminus at Sandyhills (from Dumfries or Dalbeattie). After moderate exertion to start, it goes gently downhill along an easy cliffside with sandy bays, smugglers coves, a ruined chapel and light tower, with Solway, island and coastal views, England in the background, then a lush estuaryside path by the gardens of the villas of Rockcliffe, then into the scenic touristy port of Kippford, with pubs that do food (and a bus back to SandyhillsDumfries or Dalbeattie).• A version of this walk at kirkennanMuttleeWalking on the Blorenge is bleak at this time of year, but there are lots of alternatives.

Until this week, the government was driving some asylum seekers from Nogales, Arizona, to El Paso, Texas, so they could be returned to Juárez.Now, asylum seekers will have to find their own way through dangerous Mexican border roads.About 30 asylum seekers were sent to Nogales, Mexico, on Thursday, said Gilda Loureiro, the director of the San Juan Bosco migrant shelter in Nogales, Sonora.Loureiro said the migrants hadn’t made it to the shelter yet but that it was prepared and has a capacity of about 400.“We’re going to take up to the capacity we have,” she said.Critics say the program, one of several Trump administration policies that have all but ended asylum in the US, puts migrants who fled their home countries back into dangerous Mexican border towns where they are often kidnapped, robbed or extorted.A Human Rights First report released in December documented at least 636 public reports of violence against asylum-seekers returned to Mexico including rape, kidnapping and torture. Human Rights First said that was a steep increase over October, when the group had identified 343 attacks, and noted the latest figure is surely an under-count because most crime victims don’t report.Nogales is now the eighth border crossing – and first in Arizona – through which US authorities return migrants to Mexico to await court hearings. The policy was introduced in January 2018 in San Diego.US authorities claim the program has helped to significantly reduce illegal border crossings. The border patrol apprehended just over 33,000 people along the south-west border in November, compared to 144,000 in May, when border crossings peaked."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfe6a59d17a4310cc27ff51e2d21046631f5e2c2/0_29_3178_1907/master/3178.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=648aa3778a703e987633391914e15321","title":"can merkel and macron get franco german relations back on track","story":"As a year of big EU decisions begins, the bloc’s most important relationship is stuck in a rutIn early December, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel sat down opposite each other in Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant at the Savoy Hotel, central London, for a two-hour tête-à-tête dinner. They had some talking to do.Cordial and constructive, diplomats in Paris and Berlin said, the evening apparently cleared the air. But it will take more than a dinner to clear the structural obstacles to a relationship that is critical to what Europe can achieve in 2020.“The Franco-German relationship is the single most important relationship in the EU and it’s in a totally toxic condition,” said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “And it’s going to get worse before it gets better.”There was always going to be a yawning gulf between the styles of Macron, 41, an ambitious, impatient and at times arrogant first-time French president, and Merkel, a cautious, pragmatic, consensus-building fourth-time German chancellor. But if, on matters of substance, their overarching visions coincide more often than they erge, the two leaders’ very different domestic situations have compounded their personal differences, making the relationship unproductive – or worse.Macron, halfway through his mandate at the Élysée Palace and revelling in powers that are not far short of royal, is increasingly frustrated, not just with Merkel’s slow pragmatism, but with her weakened authority since announcing she would not run again when her term ends in 2021.Worse, her grand Christian Democrat-Social Democrat coalition is ided, bent mainly on survival and frightened even to consider fresh elections in which it would be challenged by the surging popularity of the nationalist Alternative für Deutschland party (AfD) on the right and the Greens on the left.“Germany is in political paralysis, incapable of taking a major decision, and will probably remain so until elections in September 2021,” said François Heisbourg of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “Hence Macron’s frustration: France has ideas Germany is sticking its fingers in its ears.”The makeup of Germany’s current coalition would anyway prove problematic for the French president, who himself faces re-election in 2022: the centre-left SPD dislikes his proposals on developing the EU’s military and security capability, while the conservative CDU opposes his plans for the eurozone and economic integration.“Macron basically bet the farm on building a new relationship with Germany, reforming France and working with Berlin to reform Europe,” Leonard said. “He appointed German-speaking ministers and spent his first year wooing the Germans – but nothing materialised. So he pivoted.”This year, Leonard said, the French president – currently trying to push through contested pension changes at home – has “not hung around for Berlin, or even shied away from upsetting it. His approach has been to launch his initiatives, try to build relationships with other countries, and involve the Germans later. It hasn’t gone down very well.”Others, too, have been annoyed by Macron’s tendency to act first and consult later: the French president has, often alone, insisted on a shorter article 50 extension imposed his line-up for Europe’s top jobs vetoed EU accession talks for North Macedonia and demanded, with the aim of keeping Russia out of China’s clutches, “a new architecture of trust and security” with Moscow.But Berlin in particular has been vexed, culminating – after Macron told the Economist that Nato was “brain dead” – in Merkel reportedly informing her French counterpart, at an anniversary dinner commemorating the fall of the Berlin Wall, that she understood his “desire for disruptive politics” but was “tired of picking up the pieces”. Hence the Savoy dinner.The picture is not entirely bleak. Away from the headlines, steady, day-to-day bilateral work continues. Berlin and Paris are still pushing ahead where possible, albeit incrementally.German-French cooperation was “like two sides of an accordion”, a German diplomat said. “Sometimes you pull it apart a bit, then both sides come back together again. Each side knows they are joined to each other. And they know they can only produce a nice sound together.”The Franco-German relationship “is certainly not in crisis”, said Heisbourg. “But in a way, it would almost be better if it was, because then we would have a real discussion, and the chance of decisions and some substantive action.”Heisbourg added that Germany’s EU presidency, in the second half of the year, “for which Berlin surely will want to achieve something concrete”, might yet produce some progress. But Leonard was less sure.At root, he said, the problem was structural: most French voters think neither France nor Europe is working very well for them, so Macron has “no alternative but to be an agent of change and disruption” most Germans reckon things are going pretty well, so Merkel has the opposite imperative.“Why this matters,” Leonard said, “is because while it’s true that France and Germany can no longer set the EU agenda and just expect all the others to follow, if there is no consensus between Paris and Berlin, really, nothing is possible.”Ever since the 1950s, the relationship between France and Germany, the continent’s economic powerhouse and its diplomatic and military leader, has been the EU’s engine: when it works, Europe moves forward when it doesn’t, Europe stalls.The EU’s big decisions in 2020 – its new budget, eurozone reforms, carbon neutrality, digital taxation, relations with Russia – would be difficult even if France and Germany could agree and were prepared to act, Leonard said. “If they can’t and they’re not, it’s going to be very, very difficult indeed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e8753b2397482ff48ee1beb34d141c028d7d1bc/190_0_4281_2570/master/4281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bfa9298cef86641ab231cfd2f5fc336","title":"isla de valdecanas locals ecologists clash over future of spanish island resort","story":"Battle rages for 12 years over half-built tourist complex that some say should be returned to nature“Paradise found”, reads a sign at one of Spain’s more exclusive, and unlikely, beach bars. Another touts piña coladas, mojitos and caipirinhas while an adjacent notice reminds guests that shirts must be worn.On a cold, clear December afternoon, however, the artificial beach on the Isla de Valdecañas is deserted, the bar shuttered and the dog days of the year a distant memory.The question for those who work or own property on the island, which sits in a huge reservoir in the south-western Spanish region of Extremadura, is how many more summers the development will see.Twelve years after work began to turn the 130-hectare (321-acre) site into a sprawling residential, tourism and leisure complex, the project is facing demolition.Supporters of the development, who include the regional government and many residents of nearby villages – not to mention the well-heeled madrileños who have bought boltholes in the oasis less than two hours’ drive from the capital – argue that it would be folly to tear down the four-star hotel, sprawling golf course and villas.But ecologists who have been fighting the project through the courts since 2007 say the resort should never have been built on the island, which sits in a special bird protection zone and forms part of an EU-wide conservation area.In a 2011 ruling later upheld by the supreme court, the regional high court ordered the island be returned to its previous state on the basis that its designation as a “project of regional interest” was invalid.In November, the country’s constitutional court headed off another challenge by the Extremaduran regional government and the matter is once again before the regional high court, which will decide how to effect its 2011 ruling.For the time being, however, the island floats in a familiar limbo. A second hotel by the beach remains a half-built jumble of concrete and steel, and the rows of villas are shut up for winter, their drives covered with fallen leaves.Aside from the three men playing golf on the immaculate course and a rabbit that hops across the road with a spectacular lack of urgency, there are few signs of life.The Association for the Defence of Extremadura’s Nature and Resources (Adenex), which brought the legal challenge, says the court’s rulings need to be carried out to respect the law and to restore and protect bioersity.“Spain is still a democratic country and it’s the job of social and ecological movements to be transparent and consistent when it comes to defending the law and the European network of protected spaces,” it argues.The regional government, or junta – which has put the cost of demolishing the development and compensating property owners at €130m (£111m) – says restoring the island to its former state makes little sense. “It was just a space planted with eucalyptus trees with no environmental value worth preserving,” according to a spokeswoman.The junta also points out that Extremadura, one of Spain’s most neglected regions, is facing depopulation and needs to be able to offer jobs such as those provided by the development.“As far as this administration is concerned, creating economic activity and employment to avoid depopulation is in the common interest and is something that is and can be compatible with sustainability.”It hopes an agreement can be reached to preserve the finished areas, knock down the half-built ones and make the project more environmentally sustainable.Some of those who live nearby claim the development’s critics forget that the site used to be a dumping ground littered with cans, glass, plastic and old domestic appliances.“This has been going on for 12 years and people are pretty fed up with the environmental sector,” says Silvia Sarro, the mayor of the nearby village of El Gordo.“People talk about this island like it was a wilderness before but it wasn’t – it was a dump.”Sarro says the development provides service and maintenance jobs for people in El Gordo and elsewhere in the area and should be left as it is.In many parts of Europe, the issue of depopulation of the countryside, regions, or in some cases whole countries, weighs on the minds of politicians and the public, as an era of freedom of movement means more people are able to migrate to find better opportunities.A recent study by the European Council on Foreign Relations showed that in Spain, Italy, Greece, Poland, Hungary and Romania, countries where the population has either declined sharply or is flatlining, more people are worried about emigration than they are about immigration.The problem is felt acutely in central and eastern Europe, where populations have shrunk dramatically in the decades since the fall of communism, due in part to the traumatic effects of the transition, with high mortality rates, low birth rates, and millions of people travelling to western Europe to seek higher salaries, especially in the years after EU accession. In Bulgaria, for example, the population has shrunk from 9 million to 7 million since 1989.“People talk about the ‘empty Spain’ and it’s something we all feel and something we’re living through across the whole region,” she says. “What they’ve done on the island has meant that families have been able to stay in the area. There have even been some new people moving in – because of the complex.”Adenex disagrees, saying it would have been better to spend all the capital invested in the project on a legal and sustainable enterprise to bring in tourists and support the people of El Gordo and the nearby, smaller village of Berrocalejo.Some, however, remain unconvinced by those arguments.Juan Carlos Domínguez, who runs a small gardening business and has worked in the complex for more than a decade, has little nostalgia for the island of 15 years ago.“People used to dump their washing machines there once they’d stopped working,” he says, adding that demolition would ruin him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/451c7b1cc3e35887ef93c1583f05ace9aa491b0f/0_288_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0ab7b12003553499963596ec617e088","title":"julian castro drops out 2020 race president","story":"Julián Castro, the former housing secretary under Barack Obama and the only Latino candidate in the 2020 presidential race, has ended his bid for the Democratic nomination after struggling to break out in a crowded and erse field of candidates.Castro, a third-generation Mexican American, cast himself as a progressive champion of the underserved and under-represented, shaped by his humble beginnings in San Antonio, Texas, where he was raised by his activist mother and rose to be mayor. His exit leaves the field, which began as the most erse in modern history, without a Latino voice.“I’ve determined that it simply isn’t our time,” Castro said in video message released by his campaign featuring a montage from his year-long presidential bid that began with a rally in his native San Antonio. “Today it’s with a heavy heart and profound gratitude that I will suspend my campaign for president.”Castro fought for progressive issues and a nuanced approach to issues of race and ersity. He was one of the first candidates to put forward a policing reform proposal and a sweeping plan on immigration. He placed universal pre-kindergarten at the center of his education plan that called for tuition-free higher education and better pay for teachers.He managed to qualify for the first four Democratic debates – and sparked a party-wide debate over immigration when he sparred with the former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke on whether to decriminalize border crossings by undocumented migrants, as he proposed – but he did not meet the threshold for the debates that followed. Before the November debate, Castro warned in a fundraising plea that if the campaign was unable to raise more money, he would be forced to end his campaign. The pitch brought in more than $800,000, surpassing the target he set, but he was not able to translate the financial boost into sustained momentum in the polls.In recent weeks, Castro drew attention for his calls to reform the Democratic nominating process, arguing that opening with contests in Iowa and New Hampshire does not reflect the nation’s changing demographics.When the California senator Kamala Harris abruptly ended her campaign bid in early December, Castro seethed that she had been treated “very poorly” and was held to an “unfair standard” by the media.“The media’s flawed formula for ‘electability’ has pushed aside women and candidates of color,” he wrote on Twitter. “Our party’s ersity is our strength.”Castro first rose to prominence with a rousing speech at the 2012 Democratic national convention, after which he was anointed a rising star. But he struggled to raise money and faced stiff competition from a field of Democrats similarly tipped as the next generation of party leaders.In 2016, Castro was seen as a potential vice-presidential pick for Hillary Clinton, and is again considered a possible running mate for the eventual nominee, especially as Democrats seek to galvanize Latino voters and make inroads in Texas.As news of his departure spread, his 2020 rivals began to weigh in, thanking him in particular for the wealth of ideas he brought to the primary contest.In the nearly four-minute video, Castro offered no hint about future plans.“I’m not done fighting,” he said. “I’ll keep working towards a nation where everyone counts.“Ganaremos un día!” he said at the end of the video. “One day we’ll win!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f011ae36ce3906afad5c9fcdd259c3943332b4f6/0_0_4537_2722/master/4537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b80d291591b8d888e8fba1a951b23bb5","title":"lone wolf in belgium gets potential love interest","story":"Potential female mate spotted in habitat of wild male in east of country A lone wolf in Belgium has a love interest, after a potential female mate was spotted in his habitat in the east of the country, authorities have said.The Flemish Agency for Nature and Forests (ANB) revealed this week the first images of a she-wolf it has christened Noëlla, who was spotted in the north-eastern province of Limbourg, bordering the Netherlands.The agency said she was in the same habitat as August, a male who was seen “acting like a solitary wolf” after the “virtually certain” death of Naya, a female wolf who had been carrying cubs and receiving food from him.Posting nocturnal images of Noëlla on its Facebook page, the ANB said her arrival in August’s habitat was great news, adding that the wolf mating season was in February: “That makes dreams for 2020!”“It’s a female. With the she-wolf Noëlla, August has a potential new love in Limbourg,” tweeted Zuhal Demir, the Flemish region’s environment minister.“Specialists have confirmed that it is a she-wolf, by her size, new footprints and location,” Demir’s office said in a press statement. Foresters had spotted the new footprints a few weeks ago, but specialists only announced she was female when they published photos this week.After being wiped out in the early 19th century in most European countries, the wolf has staged a comeback. Wolves returned to Belgium’s Francophone region, Wallonia, in 2011 and were seen in Flanders by 2018.The first to be spotted in Flanders was Naya, who was fitted with a transponder to track her movements. She was joined in August 2018 by a male companion, named August, who was seen carrying food to her. After months with no sign of her or her cubs, authorities concluded last October it was “virtually certain” she had been killed.Wolves, which are protected by EU nature law, have not been universally welcomed, as they kill some farm animals, typically sheep.Following the discovery of Noëlla, the ANB has advised farmers to take preventative action to protect livestock. Farmers are allowed to erect electric fences to keep the wolves out and can claim compensation if animals are killed despite these efforts. In 2019, €2,412 (£2,049) was paid to Flemish farmers in 14 cases of wolf attacks."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4129000.1578002277!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government backs new 1bn silicon docks campus for trinity college","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTrinity College Dublin is planning a new campus at Grand Canal Quay. Photograph: TCDThe Government has backed plans to part-fund a new €1 billion technology campus for Trinity College Dublin in the so-called Silicon Docks area of Dublin.It will announce on Friday that it is prepared to commit up to €150 million to develop the campus over the next decade as part of a wider plan to create a new innovation district.The 400-year-old university owns a 2.2-hectare (5.5-acre) site adjacent to Grand Canal Quay, a short distance from tech firms such as Google, LinkedIn, Facebook and AirBnB.The plan involves the construction of a high-rise campus at the site over a 10-year period.The campus will be located in what will be known as the Grand Canal Innovation District, modelled on innovation districts elsewhere such as Toronto, Rotterdam and Paris.The idea is to create an eco-system where start-ups and multinational companies co-exist alongside academic researchers and venture capitalists.While the plan has been spearheaded by Trinity, it will also be home to research faculties from other Irish universities and, potentially, overseas universities. In 2018, the Government established an advisory group, chaired by secretary general of the Department of An Taoiseach Martin Fraser, to develop a blueprint for developing the district. A similar approach was taken in developing the IFSC. Its report, due to be published on Friday, recommends that the State support the project through both policy measures and financial support. The majority of the €1.1 billion cost of the development will be borne by developers, Trinity and philanthropic and corporate grants and donations. The report recommends that the Government invest €150 million in the district over the next decade. These findings were formally endorsed by the Cabinet at a recent meeting.Trinity’s Provost Patrick Prendergast said the pledge of State support is “crucial” to unlocking investment and support from the private sector. “State support, through continued policy development, political goodwill and financial investment is invaluable,” he said.“For international investors, it is a prerequisite that the importance of a project of this nature is demonstrated through Government commitments of this nature.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4129162.1578006755!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teacher sharing scheme to tackle shortages has not had any uptake","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn initiative to tackle teacher shortages by allowing secondary schools to jointly hire staff in key subjects has not resulted in a single shared teaching post. File photograph: Getty ImagesA Government initiative to tackle teacher shortages by allowing secondary schools to jointly hire staff in key subjects has not resulted in a single shared teaching post. Many schools say they are struggling to recruit qualified teachers in key subjects, including in physics, Irish, maths, European languages and home economics. In response, Minister for Education Joe McHugh earlier last year announced a new scheme to allow post-primary schools to share teachers in “priority” subjects. However, figures supplied to The  show that no teacher has been jointly hired since the scheme was announced. When the scheme was launched, Mr McHugh said he was “confident it will make a difference and help to ease the difficulties that some schools have experienced in sourcing teachers of high-priority subjects”. The idea behind the initiative was to allow two schools to work together to recruit a teacher in a “priority” subject for a job and employ them on more hours than if they were teaching in just one school. No uptake While Mr McHugh encouraged school principals and boards of management to work with neighbouring schools by hiring shared teachers, a spokesman confirmed there has been no uptake from schools in relation to the scheme. “It is extremely disappointing even though the Minister always knew there were big challenges with a sharing scheme, whether it’s travel, timetabling or sourcing teachers to work across two schools,” a spokesman for Mr McHugh said. “The Minister is still keen to see if any schools out there want to work together.” He said planning for the 202021 teacher allocation process for all post-primary schools commences next month and the Department of Education will again engage with stakeholders to encourage schools to participate in the scheme. Education observers say factors likely to be behind the lack of take-up of shared teaching posts include a reluctance to admit schools are reliant on unqualified “out of post” teachers in key roles. There are also challenges in co-ordinating recruitment decisions, as well as unfamiliarity in working with other schools.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe The Environmental Protection Agency has issued its first licence to process large volumes of Irish construction and demolition waste. The licence, issued to Panda waste management company, will facilitate its reuse as a product in road construction. In Ireland, close to zero construction and demolition waste is recycled. Due to the continued classification of these materials as “waste”, the only outlet previously available was disposal at “non-hazardous” landfills. Separately, there are persistent environmental problems with the level of illegal dumping of such waste, especially in isolated rural areas.In 2008, the EU set a target for 70 per cent of construction waste to be recycled by 2020 and such materials are widely used for a range of construction-related applications in the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Slovenia, Austria, and Latvia all of which recycle more than 90 per cent of such material. Recycled aggregate – such as sand, gravel, crushed stone, slag, and recycled concrete – makes up almost one third of the aggregates used in new-build housing in the UK. The Construction Industry Federation has repeatedly highlighted that regulations governing these by-products are “confusing and outdated”, which makes moving clean soil and stone or crushed concrete extremely difficult, as there are few licensed facilities available to receive these products.Panda, part of the Beauparc group, collects approximately 100,000 tonnes of this waste stream annually, comprised mainly of crushed concrete, but also containing ceramic, tiles, bricks and stone. Its licence will allow the processing of this material by crushing, screening, removal and separation to produce a reusable material known as “greenrock” which will be used in the construction of a new road on an EPA-licensed site in Ireland. Beauparc’s renewable energy and sustainability director David Tobin said it was a significant first step in reuse of this material in Ireland and would help towards meet Irish and EU targets for transitioning to a circular economy.“We are committed to delivering on the circular economy goal of recycling resources and materials and returning them back to the economy to be used again. This is crucial if we, as a society, want to meet the UN’s sustainable development goals,” he added.People understood that other materials which used to be considered waste should now viewed as a valuable resource, “and we believe construction waste should be no different”.Plastic recyclingThe creation of new products from construction and demolition waste not only erts materials from landfill, but “also reduces the extraction of finite aggregates resources from quarries, thereby reducing the impact on the environment”, Mr Tobin said.In 2017, an estimated 4.75 million tonnes of construction and demolition waste were collected by authorised waste collectors. Waste soil and stones made up 81 per cent of the total. Mixed construction and demolition waste accounted for 8 per cent, and concrete, bricks, tiles 7 per cent.In a separate “end of waste” application, Panda is building a major recycling facility for plastics which is due to come into operation this year. Most recycling of plastics, where possible, is conducted abroad – though there is limited capacity to recycle plastic bottles in the Republic.Beauparc employs 2,300 people, processes two million tonnes of waste, supplies more than 55,000 homes and businesses with renewable electricity and generates more than 80 gigawatt hours of electricity from landfill gas."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Courts Service says existing fines Act is not working as few pay on time or attend courtMary Mitchell O\u0026rsquoConnor says the gender equality move is \u0026lsquogame-changing moment\u0026rsquoCabinet approves report recommending \u0026euro150m for innovation district in DublinThe Government initiative has not resulted in a single shared teaching post, figures showSimon Coveney promises cash injection to support a reinstated Northern AssemblyEPA move will allow material to be erted from landfill for use in road constructionGroups representing State employees say Government must agree to new process on payThe pedestrian was hit by a vehicle in the Mountheaton area on Thursday eveningPresident, colleagues and politicians recall her skill and trailblazing feminist legacyPSNI condemn assailant as an inidual with \u0026lsquodeath and destruction on their mind\u0026rsquoMaternity hospital street protests \u0026lsquosickening\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoanti-democratic\u0026rsquo, says Simon HarrisMary Ellen Molloy (26), who was killed after tree fell on vehicle, had a \u0026lsquobeautiful personality\u0026rsquo, funeral toldWRC orders adventure centre to pay \u0026euro5,000, saying allegations were unprovenBus \u0026Eacuteireann apologises for inconvenience caused to passengersNews of surprise pregnancy followed by \u0026lsquoshock\u0026rsquo of three boys for mother with one ovary"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4129165.1578007723!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british and irish governments to publish text on restoring stormont next week","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe DUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson, Arlene Foster and Emma Little Pengelly meet with Northern  Secretary Julian Smith  at Stormont House, Belfast.

Mr Coveney made it clear that regardless of the state of the negotiations that next week he and Northern Secretary Julian Smith would present the parties with their best read of what would be a deal that all five main parties could live with or acquiesce to. “We need to make a little bit more progress before the governments are ready essentially to present the parties with what we regard as a foundation document for the re-establishment of an Executive, and effectively turn the lights on in Stormont again.“I don’t think any one party will read this and say, ‘If I was going to write it this is what it would look like’. There are compromises required from everybody in order to make this work,” he told The .“At some point next week we hope to have had sufficient discussion we hope to have created consensus around enough areas for the governments to be confident that if they table a text they can get agreement on it,” he added.Goodwill He said the Government was prepared to provide finance over the coming years to support infrastructural projects such as the A5 road linking Aughnacloy in Co Tyrone to Derry city and into Co Donegal helping create a high-speed rail link between Belfast and Dublin and assisting educational and other projects. “This is about creating goodwill but also about generating economic development and improving relationships North and South, and trying to create better connectivity on the island as a whole,” he said. Meanwhile, the mood among the parties remained positive last night, with the DUP, Sinn Féin and the SDLP each stressing their commitment to reaching an agreement to restore the North’s powersharing government. Speaking to the media after the first of two roundtable meetings yesterday chaired by Mr Smith and Mr Coveney, Sinn Féin’s chief negotiator, Conor Murphy, said he believed a deal could be done “in short order”. “We don’t see any need to run this down to the wire on January 13th in some kind of dramatic way,” he said. “The issues that we have been dealing with are well rehearsed, but what we need now is political will.” Mr Murphy said that some key issues to be resolved related to the Irish language, the petition of concern, a programme for government and a financial injection from the British government for public services.Mr Smith has given the parties until January 13th to reach a deal. The DUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson cautioned against rushing to do a deal too quickly. “We are not in the business of snatching at something because there is a deadline,” he said. While the DUP wanted a deal done “as quickly as possible”, it also wanted “to ensure that the agreement is fair and balanced, that it is sustainable”.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireSinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) expressed confidence on Thursday that a deal would be reached before January 13th to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly as talks resumed at Stormont. The Northern Secretary Julian Smith and the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney are holding talks at Stormont with the North’s five main parties in an effort to restore the powersharing institutions before the deadline of Monday week.Mr Smith and Mr Coveney held roundtable negotiations on Thursday morning with a further plenary taking place this afternoon. The two Ministers also were holding bilateral meetings with the parties to try to reinstate Stormont which collapsed almost three years ago.Sinn Féin’s chief negotiator Conor Murphy said after the first roundtable meeting that the institutions could be restored relatively quickly and before the deadline.“This agreement can be reached in short order. We don’t see any need to run this down to the wire on January 13th in some kind of dramatic way,” he said.“The issues that we have been dealing with are well rehearsed, but what we need now is political will,” he added.Mr Murphy said some of the key issues to be resolved related to the Irish language, the petition of concern, a programme for government and a financial injection from the British government for public services.“This place can’t function if we can’t deliver for public services. So we can’t sit here and be an instrument of Tory austerity. We have to have sufficient public resources to be able to deliver services which recognise the particular circumstances in this part of Ireland and the difficulties that we face,” he added. In regard to the outstanding issues he said: “None of them, I would think, need to be exhausted ad infinitum. We need to bring this to a conclusion.”With another nurses strike due for Wednesday there is pressure on the parties to reach a deal before then.DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson said his party had been engaged in “very constructive” discussions on the outstanding issues and there was a “willingness on the part of all the parties to see this over the line”.“I’m hopeful that we can on this and other issues reach a consensus, and that’s what we’re working towards,” he said. But he cautioned against an emphasis on doing a deal before Wednesday’s health strike.“Deadlines and talking about going to the wire is never a sensible way to negotiate,” he said. “We want this done as quickly as possible, but we also want to ensure that the agreement is fair and balanced that it is sustainable.”Draft agreement Asked if the DUP was now at the point where the text of a draft agreement could be published, Mr Donaldson said that “to be frank, I don’t think we’re at the stage yet where we can publish an agreement.” Discussions, he said, were “ongoing on the issues”, which included the stability of any restored Assembly and the petition of concern. He said that the party “recognise that there is a need to tighten up on the use of the petition of concern, but I think all the parties agree it should be retained as an important safeguard for all minorities.“We are not against reforming the petition of concern, in fact we favour reform, but we certainly want to see this important safeguard retained,” he saidWhile the mood at Stormont remained quite positive, political sources said a deal was unlikely this week, but that next week the remaining issues could be resolved.Earlier, Tánaiste Simon Coveney warned agreement on the restoration of power sharing in Stormont must be reached in the coming days. “We’re at the end game now, we’re running out of time.Talks aimed at restoring the devolved government are to resume at Stormont on Thursday with less than two weeks for the parties to reach a deal or face fresh Assembly elections.Each of Northern Ireland’s five main parties are participating in the in discussions.Three yearsNorthern Ireland has been without a powersharing government at Stormont since January 2017, when the Assembly collapsed following a controversy over a botched renewable heating scheme.The legislation which gives civil servants the power to keep Northern Ireland running in the absence of a devolved government expires on January 13th. Mr Smith has said the parties must reach a deal by then or he will call an election.The latest round of talks on restoring Stormont ended without agreement before Christmas, with both Mr Coveney and Mr Smith blaming the DUP for scuppering the chances of a deal, a charge the DUP “flatly rejected”.Speaking on Thursday, Mr Coveney said that for three years now while of course we had a peace process that’s still intact and in place “we have not seen the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement functioning and Northern Ireland has suffered as a result of that.“Communities become polarised when there isn’t leadership coming from the top down in terms of political parties and of course we’ve had Brexit on top of that which I think has created an environment of tension and ision in Northern Ireland as well, to put it mildly.”Mr Coveney said that there is public pressure on the politicians to get things done. “The public is frustrated.”Outstanding issuesThe outstanding issues are said by all parties to be “on the margins”, and relate to matters such as an Irish language Act, the sustainability of any reformed Stormont, and reform of the petition of concern – a vetoing system that allows parties which have 30 signatures to block motions even if these motions have majority support.DUP leader Arlene Foster said that as the talks recommence “we will be there and stand ready to restore devolution through a fair and balanced deal. A Northern Ireland that is going to keeping moving forward must be one where everyone feels at home, but must also be one where no one feels their culture is being marginalised.”"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.US airstrike kills Qassim Soleimani, head of Iran\u0026#39s elite Quds Force, at Baghdad airportQassim Soleimani: The shadowy Iranian general who undermined Washington for decadesAustralia bushfires: Residents refuse to shake prime minister Scott Morrison\u0026#39s hand as mass evacuation beginsSir Ian McKellen tops power list after raising £4 million for theatresCyprus rape case: Teenager begs Boris Johnson to bring her home and end \u0026#39waking nightmare\u0026#39Nearly three quarters of sex offenders \u0026#39removed from official register after they applied to police\u0026#39Rogue landlords who house tenants in freezing homes to be targeted by government crackdownPrince William joins forces with the Football Association to launch major mental health campaignGovernment pledges £80m for music lessons to ensure \u0026#39all children\u0026#39 know their notationBungling officials\u0026#39 decision to source contaminated blood from US prisons was unnecessary, documents revealNew DNA tests mean babies and children can be diagnosed with rare diseases in just days Children in mental distress denied NHS help until close to suicide Dracula\u0026#39s Claes Bang enters race to become the new James BondAlan Bennett reveals he had \u0026#39surprise\u0026#39 open-heart surgery last yearDonald Trump impeachment: Call to block aid to Ukraine came directly from president, new emails showLayla Moran announces she is in \u0026#39loving, stable relationship\u0026#39 with a woman and identifies as pansexualDUP and Sinn Fein edging towards deal on restoring StormontFire breaks out at scrapyard near farm with flames rising 10 metres highTens of thousands of thieves are escaping justice,  analysis revealsComment: It sounds ambitious, but a friendly Brexit orce is now on the cardsSkyer left dangling from television aerial after smashing into house defies the odds and walks againWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/09/06/TELEMMGLPICT000139406793_1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7EQDQFPyzHZLMklSLohp6Gc.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"kowtowing stormzy greta thunberg exposes elites lazy groupthink","story":"The rapper Stormzy is a national treasure to the woke establishment, despite his mangled logicJeremy Corbyn, the wintry and discontented Ghost of Seventies Christmases Past, may have spent the past weeks rattling around the political margins.

We all know the fatalistic logic: the real power lies with the governments of countries such as China, or with the banks that fund the oil industry. What can you or I really achieve with our reusable coffee cups and vegan sausage rolls, other than occupying a rather smug patch of moral high ground, or worse still, creating a comforting illusion that masks the real problem?But there is another point of view. If we take the climate crisis seriously, how can we not want to try, even in some small way, to be part of the solution? Can we really expect the countries and companies that produce the most carbon to change if we don’t show willing to make some small sacrifice in our own lives? And if we all do something, won’t governments and corporations be encouraged to reflect the wishes of the people, even if they are motivated just by winning our votes and taking our money?I’ve sensed this urge to do something while speaking to colleagues recently. And it’s the desire to contribute that has prompted us to create this series of blogs, under the banner “20 Pledges for 2020”. It started on the Lifestyle desk. Did I know, asked one of our staff, that our deputy travel editor was going flight-free for a year? For someone who must receive more invitations for all-expenses-paid trips to the sun than anyone I can name, this was no casual commitment. Then I heard there was a colleague who’s going vegan, and another determined to switch to an electric car. And so the list went on.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe’re not immune to the bigger challenges and responsibilities of the media. During our recent coverage of the UK general election, we set out to make climate the most important theme for our coverage. Looking back, we led our site and our Daily Edition app on climate issues more than any other major British publisher over the same period – no small achievement – but I can’t say we managed to make it our number-one subject it was perhaps inevitable that the NHS and Brexit dominated the political agenda even on our pages. So one of the blogs you’ll see starting over the next few weeks will be from our politics team, pledging to hold politicians to account over the climate.As for me, I’ll be blogging about how The Independent can use its reach and influence to help fight the climate crisis. This was a challenge set for me directly by our environment columnist Donnachadh McCarthy, who is also part of the media team of Extinction Rebellion. I had always been confident that The Independent was not part of the problem. I’m proud to have worked here at the time when Michael McCarthy, our former environment editor, and the late Steve Connor, our science editor, helped to blaze a trail with their reporting and analysis. The natural world was not always such a fashionable cause back then, but you knew they were on to something from the level of pushback we received – even if sometimes it was impossible not to chuckle along.Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

It’s not like we’re The Independent, we can’t just stick a headline saying ‘Cruelty’ and then stick a picture of a dolphin or a whale underneath it. I mean, that’s just cheating, that’s rubbish.” (With apologies to real fans, I’ve filtered out the fruitier adjectives.) It’s amazing to think how recently such large parts of the media were sceptical towards “climate zealots”, and still are.But Donnachadh put a challenge to me a few months ago: when you look at the Indy, is it really clear that we’re living through a crisis? Couldn’t we be doing more? He was right, of course, and we will do more, so I’ll be blogging to keep you up to date with the changes we’re making.There are three phases to climate journalism as far as I can see. First, journalists had a job to do to convince sceptics that the science is right: mankind’s use of fossil fuels is heating our planet. Then there was the second phase: how fast was the world warming, can we limit the rise to 1.5 degrees, 3 degrees, or more? That’s still a crucial debate, and a subject we will continue to track. But the 20 Pledges blogs belong to a third phase: what exactly are we going to do about it – from government policy, financial regulation and international treaties to our own compromises and choices?Before someone helpfully points out the obvious, I realise that none of us writing these blogs is perfect. I’ll start by holding my hand up: for one thing, I fly from our London office to see our US-based staff, just as our reporters often take flights to report on stories around the world, so I’ll be writing more about that in a future blog post.But this project is not about pretending to be perfect, or virtue-signalling, or being diabolically hypocritical, and we certainly aren’t setting out to preach (there’s enough climate puritanism online already). If, or when, we slip up along the way – when the trip to review a new hotel is too tempting, if the smell of a bacon sandwich catches us at a moment of weakness – we’ll write about those times too. So what are we hoping for? We hope it gives us a richer perspective on some of the more important climate stories we cover in 2020, and that by sharing our own experiences we might encourage others to share theirs too. We’ll try to use our voice to encourage change from governments too.You may want to make a pledge yourself and write a blog through the year about it with us, in which case please do get in touch. You can email all of us writing these blogs at 20pledges@, and you’ll find all the blogs, running through the year, appearing at www.news20-pledges.Your pledge may not exactly change the world by itself, but if you share your story, you never know whose mind you might change along the way.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That means no popping into M\u0026ampS for a multipack of pants. No rummaging through Primark for sale socks. And certainly no scrambling through Topshop for a last-minute party dress.\u0026nbspI write about fashion as part of my job, so I\u0027m constantly keeping an eye on new boutique brands and emerging designers, who, in all honesty, I\u0027d rather give my money to than high-street brands. Not just because it supports new talent, but because the clothes tend to be more innovative and you\u0027re less likely to show up somewhere wearing the same damn polka dot dress as every other woman there. When I first announced to my friends that I’d be giving up fast fashion, they didn’t even flinch, saying: “You think you’re too cool to shop on the high street anyway.”\u0026nbsp That said, there can be no denying that your money goes further on the high street. So I love the odd haul at Zara, H\u0026ampM, or \u0026amp Other Stories that usually happens after I’ve walked past and been seduced by something in the window. And while I’d rather source my clothes from unique second-hand shops I’ve visited on trips abroad, or designer-loaded charity shops in wealthy areas of London – there are still plenty of occasions where I have to hit the high street to get what I need because of some kind of urgent wardrobe-related mishap, like a broken zip or ripped trousers.\u0026nbspThere’s also my occasional splurging habit to consider. Occasionally I save up to buy a special piece from one of my favourite (more expensive) brands: Ganni, Rixo, APC… In my head, these are more eco-friendly purchases simply because they cost more and I’ll keep them for longer. But my logic – that more money automatically means more sustainable – is obviously flawed and based on, well, nothing.\u0026nbsp I have no idea if these purchases count as fast fashion or not because I’ve never bothered to ask. Now I will have to.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCreated with Sketch.The best dresses of the decade Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Actor Saoirse Ronan was a delight to watch in Greta Gerwig\u0027s Oscar-nominated debut, and while there were many notable outfits throughout the 2002-based film, this one remains the most meaningful. Towards the end of the film, Lady Bird goes prom dress shopping with her mum in a scene that sees their fraught relationship come to a head when Lady Bird asks “I just wish... I wish that you liked me”. Finally, she tries on this pink sparkly gown but her mother, Marion asks, “Is it too pink?” The girlish tulle gown with full skirt is reminiscent of the one worn by Molly Ringwald in the cult 1980s coming of age film, Pretty in Pink, worn as a feminist statement. OPPaul Thomas Anderson’s 2018 film Phantom Thread, centres on fictional fashion designer Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his love affair with waitress Alma (Vicky Krieps).SYYes, you read that right. Balloon dresses. Jaws literally dropped when Central Saint Martins graduate sent models down the runway in balloon concubines that the models then popped, causing the outfits to slowly slide down onto the model\u0027s bodies, eventually becoming dresses. We\u0027re still not sure how he did it either, but the dresses sparked a frenzy on social media, with editors and fashion insiders all regaling at Tjaerands\u0027 sheer creativity. OP450 47 - Moneypenny\u0027s gown in Skyfall, Amanda Wakeley, 2012In what is unquestionably one of the most glamorous on-screen gowns of the decade, Naomie Harris turned about a thousand heads in this gold Amanda Wakeley gown. The column-shaped, one-shouldered dress features three straps and was constructed with fabric that fanned out from the waist to reveal folds and cuts like a sunray, twisting around Harris\u0027 torso and elevating the power and authority of her character, who remains one of the most memorable “Bond Girls” of all time. OP550 46 - Suzy Bishop\u0027s pink dress in Moonrise Kingdom, 2012This dress in Wes Anderson\u0027s 2012 Moonrise Kingdom embodies all the childhood innocence and nostalgia that defines the film. From its bubblegum-coloured hue and its Peter Pan collar to the Sixties A-line cut and the knee-high socks it\u0027s worn with, this dress was one of the best costumes in cinema from the last decade. No, it wasn\u0027t grand. And it certainly didn\u0027t look expensive, either. But, like the film itself, the dress is an homage to childlike nativity and it couldn\u0027t have been more appropriate. OPFor springsummer 2020, Rodarte designers Laura and Kate Mulleavy shunned a traditional runway show and instead chose to present their latest collection via a series of ethereal portraits.SYWhen Adut Akech stepped on stage to collect the award for 2019\u0027s model of the year, she received a standing ovation. The accolade marked a major step for the fashion industry in terms of ersity, which Akech spoke about in her rousing acceptance speech. This is for the young women and men who found representation and validation in my work, she told the crowd of designers and celebrities. I want them to never be afraid of dreaming big like I once did. Her words were bolstered by the boldness of her gown on the night: an emerald green, Christmas tree-esque Valentino gown with a bow for a bodice and a thigh-high slit. It was power personified. OPFor his 2012 adaptation of Leo Tolstoy classic Anna Karenina, director Joe Wright asked costume designer Jacqueline Durran to ensure that the leading lady (played by Keira Knightley) be dressed in costumes in the style of 1950s couture, despite the story’s 19th-century setting.SYAs a frequent front runner on the red carpet, it comes as no surprise that Janelle Monáe arrived at the 2019 Met Gala with one of the evening\u0027s best looks.SYGetty Images for The Met MuseumRodarte tutus played a starring role in the acclaimed thriller in which Natalie Portman plays a ballerina who slowly finds herself slipping into madness while practicing for a performance of Black Swan. The black tutu, worn when Portman\u0027s character dramatically casts off her innocent facade and embraces her dark side as she transforms into the Black Swan, was worn with bold feathering eye make-up, bloodshot eyes and a dark red lip. There was a scandal surrounding the dress, too. Given that neither Kate nor Laura Mulleavy (the designers at Rodarte) were part of the Costume Designers Guild, they weren\u0027t eligible for an Oscar for best costume for their work on the film.

With messages like “I\u0027m not shy, I just don\u0027t like you,” “Sorry I\u0027m late, I didn\u0027t want to come,” and “NO,” these voluminous tulle gowns made quite the statement when they graced the runway at Paris Couture Week in January. Not only did it suddenly seem like all our darkest and most millennial thoughts were suddenly displayed on gargantuan tutus, but said tutus went on to almost break the internet with the countless memes they prompted. People shared the photos in WhatsApp groups, tagged themselves on social media, and captioned them with things like ”Mood”. OPFor the 2019 Grammy Awards, rapper Cardi B arrived on the red carpet wearing a look straight out of a Botticelli painting. The Little Mermaid. SYIn 2012, Angelina Jolie quite literally stepped out in a black Atelier Versace gown that came with a thigh-high slit, revealing much of the actor’s leg. Jolie posed for photographers with her right leg pointed outwards, to exaggerate the slit and ensured that almost every image showed her in that pose. Showing true dedication, Jolie even maintained the pose when she presented an award on stage. The stance generated a flurry of memes and a hashtag: #AngiesRightLeg. OPDressing a First Lady for the inauguration is a momentous occasion, and one that many designers consider to be the greatest honour of their career. So, when Michelle Obama chose a relatively unknown name within the fashion sphere for the occasion, critics were taken by surprise. For her debut as First Lady, Obama chose an ivory, one-shouldered gown designed by 26-year-old Jason Wu, who was a relatively little known designer at the time. Like the rest of the world, Wu had no idea that the Obama was seriously considering wearing one of his designs and claimed that he wasn\u0027t even sure that the white chiffon dress she wore was his until the phone began to ring. “It\u0027s difficult to describe,” Wu said the following afternoon, after appearing on the morning shows. “I was over the moon. I know I am an unusual choice for a first lady. I didn\u0027t think it was my turn yet.” SYThe video for Beyonce’s visual album Lemonade in 2016 was filled with fashion that had the world abuzz, from a floral Gucci suit to a two-piece Yeezy ensemble.When Jennifer Lopez wore this dress to the 2000 Grammys it went down in fashion history, second only to Elizabeth Hurley’s iconic safety pin moment in 1994. Over the years, numerous brands have tried to copy the Versace gown but no one has managed to do it justice quite like J.Lo herself. In September 2019, the singer gave the fashion pack a dose of nostalgia at Milan Fashion Week by closing the Versace show wearing an updated version of the gown 20 years later. The crowd rose to its feet as J.Lo walked the room before linking arms with Donatella Versace for the final applause. The gown is also the reason we now have Google Images. Following Lopez’s 2000 appearance, people were so fascinated by the dress that they tried to search for photos on Google. In February, the Pose star became the most talked-about guest at the Oscars thanks to his tuxedo gown, designed by Christian Siriano. But Porter’s gown didn’t just defy sartorial conventions by blending a suit with a dress, it subverted gender norms and reflected a key societal shift. In the last year, we’ve seen more and more brands create unisex lines, showing that there is no such thing as dressing according to your gender and giving way for all of us to feel a little bit more liberated about the clothes we wear. Speaking about the gown to Variety, Porter described wearing it as a form of activism. “I knew that that tuxedo gown at the Oscars would create a conversation surrounding what gender means, what all these rules we put on everybody in life,” he said. “We’ve gotten past a problem with women wearing pants. When women wear pants it’s powerful. When men wear a dress it’s disgusting. We’re not doing that anymore. I’m not doing it.” OPWhile Meghan Markle opted for a white Givenchy wedding dress designed by artistic director Clare Waight Keller for her wedding ceremony, the bride turned to Stella McCartney for her reception gown. The Duchess of Sussex looked every bit the duchess  in the white silk halterneck gown which featured a dramatic low back and full-length skirt. The elegant dress drew compliments the world over and prompted many a copycat design before the actual dress itself became available to buy online for £3,500. According to McCartney, Markle chose her because she is a female British designer. I think being a woman and being a women’s woman played a part,” McCartney said. SYWhen an item of clothing becomes more synonymous with a breakfast than the designer who spent two years making it, you pay attention. The yolk yellow gown that Rihanna wore to the Met Gala in 2015 spawned so many memes that it’s hard to keep track of them all. Items photo-shopped onto the dress by social media users included pepperoni pizza and a Gregg’s sausage roll, but it was memes that reimagined RiRi’s gown as an omelette that acquired the most notoriety. To this day, you can ask anyone engaged with popular culture about the omelette dress and they will immediately know what you’re talking about. In fact, the elaborate caped gown was created by Chinese couturier Guo Pei and took two years to make. Two pieces by Pei were being shown at the Costume Institute that year as part of the “China: Through the Looking Glass” exhibition, which the Met Gala was held to celebrate.OPIn 2015, the internet was ided after a photo of a dress functioned as an accidental experiment in colour perception.Never has tulle caused such a ruckus. When Jodie Comer stomped across our screens in Killing Eve wearing Balenciaga biker boots and Molly Goddard’s frothy pink dress, it turned the British designer into a household name. OPFor the 2010 MTV Music Video Awards, Lady Gaga turned her back on the usual glamorous red carept garb, wearing dress made from raw flank steak, complete with matching ankle boots, a handbag and hat. In an interview with the Financial Times, Lady Gaga said the look referred to a speech she made, The Prime Rib of America, which urged the US military not to discriminate against gay men and lesbians from serving in the army. In 2015, the dress was put on display at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland, Ohio.  SY4950 2 - The Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s wedding dress, Alexander McQueen, 2011Kate Middleton and Prince William\u0027s wedding on 29 April 2011 included many memorable moments but no detail has stood the test of time quite like the duchess’s iconic wedding dress. SY5050 1 - The black dresses at the Golden Globes, 2018While the Golden Globes are typically cause for celebration, 2018’s ceremony served as the scene of a major protest. Countless actors, presenters and nominees – including Meryl Streep, Jessica Chastain and Emma Stone – chose to wear all-black clothing in protest of sexual harassment in the entertainment industry and beyond. The move was a symbolic show of solidarity with victims of sexual harassment as part of the Time’s Up movement. Speaking about her decision to wear black to the event, Allison Brie said: I am wearing black to stand in solidarity with all of the women who have come out about being sexually harassed and abused. I\u0027m so in awe of the bravery it took for the first few to come forward. They are heroes. Out of all the women who attended the 2018 globes, just three chose not to wear black. SYAll things considered, then, I presumed this pledge would be easy. I’d finally kick my \u0026amp Other Stories habit, something that might harm\u0026nbspthe planet as much as it harms my wallet, and enjoy the feeling of knowing I’ll be making better, more sustainable sartorial choices. But having given this some thought, I’m not sure how comfortable I feel about waving goodbye to the ease and accessibility that high street shopping allows. What if I ladder my tights at work? Or forget to pack a second pair of underwear for after my lunchtime gym session? Such issues arise – all too often for me – and it’s arguably easiest to solve them by heading to the nearest high street shop, which, let’s face it, is probably not going to sell eco-friendly lingerie.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E.

The bank also said its gauge of Brexit uncertainty in its monthly Decision Makers’ Panel survey fell to a six-month low in December.Brexit uncertainty will still bedevil the markets in 2020More than half (53 per cent) of firms reported that Brexit was one of their top three sources of uncertainty in December. That was slightly lower compared to the average of the previous three months. However, Brexit-related uncertainty remains well above its average since the referendum.Fears about renewed tensions between London and Brussels undermined the value of the pound. Sterling fell 0.4 per cent against the US dollar and 0.2 against the euro.The drop against the dollar wiped off some of the 7.9 per cent rise in the pound’s exchange rate in the final quarter of the year, which had made it the strongest currency pair in the 2019 rankings by Deutsche Bank.“Much of sterling’s gains came after prime minister Johnson and the EU agreed a new deal in October, and the gains in GBPUSD over the last three months mark the strongest quarterly performance since the second quarter of 2009,” said research analyst Henry Allen.Capital Economics, the London-based consultancy, believes the pound will end 2020 almost 4 per cent higher at $1.35 by the end of the year as the outlook for the UK economy brightens thanks to reduced political uncertainty and a large fiscal boost.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A keeper counts squirrel-monkeys at London Zoo during the annual stocktake.

Shopper numbers fell almost 9 per cent on Boxing Day, which used to be a traditional start of the sales, according to retail intelligence firm Springboard.“Consumers are increasingly using Boxing Day primarily for leisure purposes, going out to eat or to the cinema, but possibly combining this with a visit to retail stores rather than shopping being the main focus of the trip,” said Springboard\u0027s insights director Diane Wehrle.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Managers linked the falls in new business to ongoing concerns surrounding the economic, global trade and political outlook. New export business fell for the second month running.The drop in activity has fed through to job numbers as manufacturers cut employment for the ninth month\u0026nbspin a row.Job losses were registered across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors and at companies of all sizes.“This impact trickled down to job creation strategies, as the pace of job losses intensified and companies were reluctant to commit to additional expense,” Mr Brock said.Mr Brock said although the result of the general election would bring some “clarity” to businesses, he warned that manufacturers faced a long road ahead to recover last year\u0027s losses. “In the closing stages of the year, the sector has ended on a dreary note,” he said. “There will still be some obstacles to overcome in 2020.”Manufacturers to end 2019 at ‘standstill’ over Brexit uncertaintyFhaheen Khan, senior economist at Make UK, the manufacturing and engineering employers’ organisation, said uncertainties over the outcome of Brexit, the outcome of the general election, and global trade tensions had “clearly weighed on” the UK’s manufacturing sector.However, CIPS said business sentiment remained positive in December with more than 43 per cent of companies forecasting output would be higher a year from now, compared to only 10 per cent anticipating a contraction. The optimism was linked to reduced uncertainty, new product launches, increased efficiency and improved client confidence, it said.The downbeat picture was reflected in the eurozone where the equivalent index dropped from 46.9 in November to 46.3 in December, marking an eleventh successive month of contraction. Germany was again the weakest-performing country, while the deteriorations seen in Italy and the Netherlands were the sharpest in more than six and a half years.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank also said its gauge of Brexit uncertainty in its monthly Decision Makers’ Panel survey fell to a six-month low in December.Brexit uncertainty will still bedevil the markets in 2020More than half (53 per cent) of firms reported that Brexit was one of their top three sources of uncertainty in December. That was slightly lower compared to the average of the previous three months. However, Brexit-related uncertainty remains well above its average since the referendum.Fears about renewed tensions between London and Brussels undermined the value of the pound. Sterling fell 0.4 per cent against the US dollar and 0.2 against the euro.The drop against the dollar wiped off some of the 7.9 per cent rise in the pound’s exchange rate in the final quarter of the year, which had made it the strongest currency pair in the 2019 rankings by Deutsche Bank.“Much of sterling’s gains came after prime minister Johnson and the EU agreed a new deal in October, and the gains in GBPUSD over the last three months mark the strongest quarterly performance since the second quarter of 2009,” said research analyst Henry Allen.Capital Economics, the London-based consultancy, believes the pound will end 2020 almost 4 per cent higher at $1.35 by the end of the year as the outlook for the UK economy brightens thanks to reduced political uncertainty and a large fiscal boost.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A keeper counts squirrel-monkeys at London Zoo during the annual stocktake.

Shopper numbers fell almost 9 per cent on Boxing Day, which used to be a traditional start of the sales, according to retail intelligence firm Springboard.“Consumers are increasingly using Boxing Day primarily for leisure purposes, going out to eat or to the cinema, but possibly combining this with a visit to retail stores rather than shopping being the main focus of the trip,” said Springboard\u0027s insights director Diane Wehrle.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes.

There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Given that both Dracula and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes books were set and published in the Victorian era (Moffat and Gatiss set their BBC\u0026nbspSherlock series in the present day), it was easy enough for fans to deduce that the writers were making a playful link between the two. \u0026nbspThe BBC’s new adaptation of Dracula has gone down very well with viewers, who have described it as “bloody stunning” and “horrifying”, with some going so far as to call it the “best adaptation” of the book to date.It was awarded four stars by The Independent’s critic Ed Cumming, who said it “adds fresh wit and energy to the vampire legend”.Dracula continues on Thursday 2 January at 9pm on BBC1.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

New York native Iliza Shlesinger brings a fresh take on topics from modern dating to wedding planning headaches. Her show is a delightful mix of reality checks and insightful takes.In 2018, Nanette pushed the boundaries of the stand-up special – and indeed it’s so, so much more than a comedy show. In a little more than an hour, Hannah Gadsby deconstructs the makings of a good joke, explains why she’s done with self-deprecation, and delivers an unforgettable, incredibly powerful take on the trauma she’s experienced as a lesbian in Tasmania.Standout line: “I have built a career out of self-deprecating humour and I don’t want to do that anymore. Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It’s not humility, it\u0027s humiliation. I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak, and I simply will not do that anymore. Not to myself or anybody who identifies with me.”If you liked Ali Wong in Always Be My Maybe (which she co-wrote!), then you’re going to love her in Hard Knock Wife (her second Netflix special and a follow-up on her 2016 debut Baby Cobra). Her unapologetic takes on motherhood and marriage (did you know she makes a lot more money than her husband and she’s not sorry?) are gold.Standout line: “Now, I make a lot more money than my husband by, like, a long shot. My mom is very concerned that he’s going to leave me out of intimidation. I had to explain to her that the only kind of man who would leave a woman who makes more money… is the kind of man that doesn’t like free money.”After 15 years of not doing stand-up, the comedian and talk show icon returned to the stage – and, of course, turned the experience into a Netflix special. Under the pretence of pondering whether she’s still relatable, Ellen DeGeneres basks in the (well-earned) glory her accomplishments, reflects on her personal experiences – including her 1997 coming-out and how it was received in Hollywood – and riffs on the absurdities of daily life. What a treat.510 Son of Patricia, Trevor NoahTrevor Noah has been starring in comedy specials for a decade, so it’s no surprise that he can take just about any topic (tourism in Bali, trap music, a conversation with President Barack Obama) and turn it into incisive jokes.Katherine Ryan’s second Netflix special (the follow-up to In Trouble, which came out in 2017) tackles some of her trademark topics, from dating to co-parenting, in a lighthearted, self-affirming way. A delight through and through.Back in 2012, Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, was appearing as the unforgettable Troy Barnes in Community – and spared a little time to record a Netflix special, which remains available to this day. Throughout this one-hour show, he shows off his range, reflecting on his music career, reaching his late twenties, and that brief time when the internet really wanted him to play Spider-Man.Standout line: “I lived in Downtown LA, and Downtown LA is kind of like the Eighties decided to stay there. They’re like, ‘Oh, OK, you guys go ahead and be the Nineties. Go enjoy Ace of Base – we’ll be here practicing the Moonwalk and selling crack.’”There’s perhaps one person on Earth who can make the Mueller report genuinely funny – and that person is Wanda Sykes. The comedian might be best known for her roles on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Black-ish, but her stand-up is well worth a watch. She has impeccable timing, sharp writing, and an apparently effortless ability to connect with her crowd.Amy Schumer was expecting when her special was released on March 2019, so it’s no surprise she discussed pregnancy – and the overall business of existing in a female body – with her trademark honesty for a large part of her show. This special is actually made up of two shows, Dark and Jigsaw. The Scottish comedian refreshes the “fish out of water” archetype by delivering his take on the US – and that time he told a joke about being an atheist in Indiana. His smart writing enables him to tackle topics, such as disability and – yes – paedophilia, in a way few comics could pull off.Standout line: “As a parent – no, I’m not a parent, but I like speaking for other people, because I’m white, middle-class and male, and that’s what my people do.”If you didn’t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again.

He’s won two Academy Awards and three Golden Globes for his powerful and varied performances, starring in such films as Philadelphia, Forrest Gump, Castaway, Apollo 13 and Saving Private Ryan. The other... is Tim Allen.”Created with Sketch. Show all 4Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.After hosting the Golden Globes from 2010 to 2012, Gervais returned to the ceremony in 2016 – and chose to devote part of his opening monologue to joking about Caitlyn Jenner, who had recently come out as transgender and was documenting her transition publicly. “Hey @RickyGervais. It’s 2016. Jokes at the expense of trans people are so tired. Catch up,” GLAAD tweeted at the time. Gervais has since doubled down on this line of comedy in a Netflix special. In September 2019, he tweeted: “You can joke about whatever the f*** you like. And some people won\u0027t like it and they will tell you they don\u0027t like it. And then it\u0027s up to you whether you give a f*** or not. And so on. It\u0027s a good system.” Hence, the bottom spot in this ranking.Fresh off a particularly biting 2011 hosting set, was Gervais struggling to figure out just the right amount of meanness for the ceremony? The comedian didn’t seem quite like himself that time around. He delivered some good lines, among them: “For any of you who don’t know, the Golden Globes are just like the Oscars, but without all that… esteem” and “The Hollywood Foreign Press have warned me that if I insult any of you, or any of them, or offend any viewers, or cause any controversy whatsoever, they’ll definitely invite me back next year.” Still, this year doesn’t stand out in Gervais’s Golden Globes history.In 2011, Gervais’s jokes were so incisive, so daring and – let’s just say it, mean – that they elicited occasional gasps from the audience. Over the course of the evening, the comedian took aim at the 2010 film The Tourist starring Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie (“It seems like everything this year was three-dimensional, except the characters in The Tourist,” he quipped), Robert Downey Jr, and the president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which organises the Golden Globes. Gervais’s set was so controversial that some wondered whether it would prove to be his last – but the comedian has now been invited back three more times.Gervais’s first turn as host was also his best. Almost 10 years ago, the comedian proved to be a delightfully sarcastic emcee, capable of the most ferocious take-downs. His best lines of the night were delivered with fake enthusiasm, such as when Gervais – the creator of the original version of The Office in the UK, tore into the US version starring Steve Carell (“Where does he get his ideas from?” Gervais mused). The 2010 ceremony also included this brilliant bit about writers in Hollywood: “This next category is a bit of a downer, to be honest: it’s for writing. We all know writers get way too much credit in Hollywood, and that’s due to the generosity of actors sometimes mentioning them.” And let’s not forget what is perhaps Gervais’s most celebrated Golden Globes quip, through which he introduced Mel Gibson to the stage: “I like a drink as much as the next man,” Gervais said, glass in hand. “Unless the next man… is Mel Gibson.”After hosting the Golden Globes from 2010 to 2012, Gervais returned to the ceremony in 2016 – and chose to devote part of his opening monologue to joking about Caitlyn Jenner, who had recently come out as transgender and was documenting her transition publicly. “Hey @RickyGervais.

So I came out and said, ‘Our next two presenters, the first has won five Oscars, combined box office of five billion dollars. And the other, Tim Allen.’ Right? It’s a fine joke. I’m teasing Tim Allen,” the comedian said.“But anyone standing next to Tom Hanks, unless it’s Dustin Hoffman or Robert Redford or Robert De Niro, that could be me. But it happened to be Tim Allen. And I have nothing against Tim Allen. He’s a good actor. He’s probably a nice bloke.”Gervais\u0026nbspinsisted there was “no malice” behind his joke, adding that he didn’t want Allen to feel personally targeted by it.Rather, he said, he made fun of Allen simply because he was “standing next to Tom Hanks” in that instant.The 2020 Golden Globes will take place on 5 January.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bird, floating on the seawater beneath a cliff, held a stick in its beak.It began to scratch its back with the stick – the puffin, as Ms Fayet watched, was using a tool.Ms Fayet, a puffin expert who studies how the birds migrate and feed, wrote about the crafty bird in her notebook. But she had no photo evidence of this first-of-a-kind sighting. “It was just one observation, and I was busy doing something else,” she said. As unusual as this was, Ms Fayet said, she “kind of forgot about it”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUntil it happened again. In July 2018, Ms Fayet was studying another group of puffins at Grimsey Island in Iceland, about a thousand miles from Wales. She planted camera traps on the island and recorded “loads and loads of puffin behaviour”.Another puffin used a scratching stick. This time, the action unfolded in front of a camera: The bird spots a stick and grasps it with a cartoon-bright beak. The bird makes a burbling sound. It turns, as if to face the lens. And then it scratches its chest feathers with the stick’s pointy end.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Over 400 species discovered this year by Natural History MuseumThe ancient invertabrate worm-like species rhenopyrgus viviani (pictured) is one of over 400 species previously unknown to science that were discovered by experts at the Natural History Museum this year220 Jackdaws can identify \u0027dangerous\u0027 humansJackdaws can identify “dangerous” humans from listening to each other’s warning calls, scientists say. 320 Turtle embryos influence sex by shakingThe sex of the turtle is determined by the temperatures at which they are incubated.

This was not some nesting behaviour gone awry. Puffins collect soft grass for their nests, then hurry into their burrows with beaks full of bedding. The puffin in Iceland dropped the stick after it finished scratching. Hours later, the camera recorded the stick, still discarded, on the ground.This behaviour “fits all current definitions” of tool use, said University of Oxford zoologist Alex Kacelnik, who has studied toolmaking crows and was not a member of the puffin research team.Outrage over trophy hunts to Iceland to kill puffinsMs Fayet sent the recording to her colleague Dora Biro, an animal behaviour expert at the University of Oxford. The video immediately excited Ms Biro because, as she said, “this was a puffin, this was a seabird – and tool use had never been reported in seabirds before”. Together, with their colleague Erpur Snaer Hansen, the biologists described puffin tools in a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Studying animal tools can help scientists understand the origins of our own Stone Age, which began when our ancestors picked up rocks around 2.6 million years ago. But tools wielded by beak, paw or snout are rare. Scientists have observed tool use in fewer than 1 per cent of species, which are erratically scattered among animal groups. Chimpanzees and several other primate species use tools. Yet so do sea otters, fish and even some insects, such as ants that sop up honey in spongy matter.Several bird species use tools. Crows in the Pacific, for instance, use hooked twigs to catch grubs. But back-scratching is an unusual form of tool use that the scientists called “body care”. The only other type of body care observed in wild birds, Ms Biro said, is “anting”, in which birds cover their bodies in insects. Bug juices, biologists suspect, can act as chemical defences against bird parasites or fungi.The puffin in Iceland may have been trying to rid itself of ticks. “At the time, when these observations were made, there was also a particularly high parasite load on the birds that year,” Ms Biro said. A scientist who reviewed Ms Biro and Ms Fayet’s paper suggested the stick could have had chemical properties, too. (That’s hard to say the twig was dry, and the scientists don’t know what sort of plant it was.)Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After all, why use a stick when a beak could do? He wondered whether the irritants on the puffins could be “toxic or particularly distasteful” – like a smear of boat fuel, perhaps – “hence the birds may have wanted to avoid beak contact”. In experiments, New Caledonian crows, the grub-fishing species, will use sticks to touch objects the birds perceive as dangerous, such as rubber spiders, he said.Or, maybe, the satisfaction of an itch well-scratched is just one of those things that transcends species.University of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He claims he was whistleblowing.But lawyers for the charity say he defied managers’ rules. The league says that in 2015, pension guidelines changed, so it was unable to automatically enrol new staff in an ethical scheme. It rectified this when it was made aware of the rule changes.A spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid if they dismissed staff on the grounds of being vegetarian or vegan they would have few staff left and they were not contesting his claim that veganism should be protected.She referred to a statement from 2018, saying: “The discussion about veganism being a ‘philosophical belief’ is a thought-provoking one which many of our staff will be interested in however, this debate has absolutely no connection with why Mr Casamitjana was sacked.”The statement went on: “Mr Casamitjana was not dismissed because he raised concerns about the pension, either internally or externally, so our view is that there is no substance to his claims that he was ‘whistleblowing’.”\u0026nbspThe charity said the reason for his dismissal was confidential but said it was sad that a former employee, who was passionate about protecting animals, was taking action against one of the UK’s most vegan-friendly employers.\u0026nbspThis week’s hearing, by a panel in Norwich, which will focus on the status of veganism, will be followed by a tribunal in April to judge the dismissal case.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship.

Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. Stormzy responded by branding Wiley a “pr**k” and claiming that Wiley’s anger was at odds with the direct messages he had sent.\u0026nbsp“OK I actually think you do crack coz you dm’d me yesterday saying ‘bro omg let’s build houses in Ghana for our mums’ and now you’re here moving mad,” Stormzy tweeted.“You are a pr**k coz you dm me all the time like it’s mad love and we’re brothers and then you come on the internet and act weird and the reason that makes you a prick is because you know I won’t ever say anything on the TL because arguing on the net has never been my style,” he added.Wiley then responded: “You ain’t ready for smoke mike your a star go be a star and mind ya own bizness on this 1.”Stormzy lashes out at media for ‘intentionally spinning’ his words Harry Styles chants ‘f*** Boris’ as Stormzy joins him on stageStormzy’s second album heralds a man who knows exactly who he isAfter a continued back-and-forth, Stormzy dismissed Wiley’s suggestion that the pair meet to work out their differences.“Shut up man no one wants to link you you dinosaur lol,” he said.He added: “I love you so much but you are so annoying.”Many fans pointed out Wiley’s hypocrisy for mocking Stormzy’s Sheeran collaboration, given Wiley also teamed up with the singer-songwriter for the track “You”, from Sheeran’s 2011 EP No 5 Collaborations Project.Stormzy is currently on course to score the first number one of the decade with “Own It”, against Lewis Capaldi’s “Before You Go” and Dua Lipa’s “Don’t Start Now”.Heavy is the Head\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Defence chiefs were perplexed.It turned out the interlopers were playing Pokemon Go, the augmented reality mobile game which launched that month and quickly sparked a global phenomenon.More than three years on, newly released documents have revealed how the Canadian military responded to the trespassers entering its compounds in search of digital creatures.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMuch of the initial reaction expressed confusion and curiosity, files obtained by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) show.“The game’s premise seems to be going to the ‘PokeStopsGyms’ to collect ‘Pokemons’,” noted David Levenick, a security expert at Borden base of northwest Toronto. “We should almost hire a 12-year-old to help us out with this.”Created with Sketch.Pokemon Centre opens in London Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.At least three officers at different bases were assigned to play the game, which challenges users to find virtual monsters in real-world locations.

They warned a PokeStop at North Bay would cause increase in traffic and “could have a negative impact on 22 Wing’s Mission,” while another at Halifax naval base was deemed to be a “security risk”.But the military correspondence shows the response to the game was not always hostile.After a PokeStop was found at a museum at Garrison Petawawa in Ontario, Major Alicia Saucier wrote: “Maybe some extra people will visit the museum!”Rear Admiral John Newton even\u0026nbsprecommended adding a PokeStop at another location in Halifax because “this addition, with the already existing PokeStops at the museum and the admiral’s residence, would increase the museum’s attendance”.Life and work are best accomplished if there is good fun, health and friendship, he wrote. If Pokemon Go enables these values, while we protect our interests, then we all stand to marvel at this intersection of technology, gaming and health.At the height of its popularity, hundreds of millions of people worldwide were playing Pokemon Go, which rose to the top of app download charts as the craze swept around across the globe. User numbers have since declined, although the game retains a loyal fanbase.The app has been credited with promoting physical activity and helping local businesses by increasing footfall, but it also attracted controversy following a string of accidents involving users distracted by their phones.Players in Bosnia have strayed into minefields in search\u0026nbspof Pokemon, while police in Washington state last year pulled over a driver who was playing the game\u0026nbspon eight devices\u0026nbspsimultaneously.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Insiders have already suggested that Mr Serraj will end up asking for up to 2,000 Turkish soldiers to defend the capital against the forces of renegade officer Khalifa Haftar and his foreign backers.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspcontroversial measure to send troops was passed in Turkey\u0027s parliament on Thursday by 325 to 184 votes, with opposition lawmakers voting against it.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTurkey has already reportedly recruited and deployed scores of Syrian fighters to Libya to bolster forces defending the capital, Tripoli. That has elicited protests from Mr Haftar’s backers, including the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, the latter of which organised an emergency summit of the Arab League this week to discuss Libya.\u0026nbspThe security and maritime pacts between Libya and Turkey have also provoked Greece and Cyprus, which are nervous about Turkish expansion across the Mediterranean. Both have begun conferring with Cairo and lining up with Haftar’s backers, which include France and Russia. Greek foreign minister Nikolaos Dendias travelled to eastern Libya late last month to meet Mr Haftar.Meanwhile Libya’s neighbour Algeria and its former colonial overlord Italy,\u0026nbsploosely backing the government in Tripoli, appear more sanguine about the impending Turkish intervention.Created with Sketch.Libya airstrike: Migrant detention centre hit in airstrike, killing 60 Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Migrants carry the remains of their belongings from among rubble at a detention centre for African migrants that was hit by an airstrike in the Tajoura suburb of Libyan capital Tripoli on July 2Security and emergency responders work at the site of an airstrike that hit a detention centre for African migrants near Tripoli, Libya on June 2Security and emergency responders work at the site of an airstrike that hit a detention centre for African migrants near Tripoli, Libya on June 2The point of impact of a bomb that was dropped on a detention centre for African migrants near Tripoli, Libya on June 2Blood stains are seen among debris following an airstrike that hit a detention centre  for African migrants near Tripoli, Libya on June 2A woman picks up clothes among rubble at a detention centre for African migrants that was hit by an airstrike in the Tajoura suburb of Libyan capital Tripoli on July 2Migrants gather outside following an airstrike on the detention centre in the Tajoura suburb of Libyan capital Tripoli on July 2A man carries his belongings from among rubble at a detention centre for African migrants that was hit by an airstrike in the Tajoura suburb of Libyan capital Tripoli on July 2Migrants sit together with their remaining belongings in the yard of the detention centre that was hit by an airstrike in the Libyan capital of Tripoli on July 2Migrants carry the remains of their belongings from among rubble at a detention centre for African migrants that was hit by an airstrike in the Tajoura suburb of Libyan capital Tripoli on July 2Security and emergency responders work at the site of an airstrike that hit a detention centre for African migrants near Tripoli, Libya on June 2Security and emergency responders work at the site of an airstrike that hit a detention centre for African migrants near Tripoli, Libya on June 2The point of impact of a bomb that was dropped on a detention centre for African migrants near Tripoli, Libya on June 2Blood stains are seen among debris following an airstrike that hit a detention centre  for African migrants near Tripoli, Libya on June 2A woman picks up clothes among rubble at a detention centre for African migrants that was hit by an airstrike in the Tajoura suburb of Libyan capital Tripoli on July 2Migrants gather outside following an airstrike on the detention centre in the Tajoura suburb of Libyan capital Tripoli on July 2A man carries his belongings from among rubble at a detention centre for African migrants that was hit by an airstrike in the Tajoura suburb of Libyan capital Tripoli on July 2Migrants sit together with their remaining belongings in the yard of the detention centre that was hit by an airstrike in the Libyan capital of Tripoli on July 2At stake is the future of Libya, now in the grips of a nine-month civil conflict pitting forces loyal to Mr Haftar against the authority in Tripoli, which is called the Government of National Accord.\u0026nbspBut the\u0026nbspentrance of Turkey as a player in Libya, with their maritime and security deals, has accelerated a scramble to exploit potentially hundreds of billions of dollars worth of underwater fossil fuel reserves claimed by the nations of the eastern Mediterranean. Greece and Cyprus worry the deals delineate\u0026nbspmaritime borders that Ankara could cite to explore oil and gas in the area.The deals have “brought about gains of great strategic importance for our country”, Mr Erdogan said in a New Year’s Eve speech. “The projects aimed at entirely excluding Turkey from the Mediterranean have thus been wholly thwarted with our recent steps.”Turkey has already sent military drones and armoured vehicles to its Libyan allies, while the UAE and Egypt continue funneling weapons to Mr Haftar, according to a United Nations report.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailTrump will come last in the Mediterranean gas race over LibyaExperts say Turkey has long sought the maritime expansion deal, which gives it the ability to project its power across the sea and puts pressure on Greece to reopen long-dormant talks on control over disputed Aegean Sea islands and waterways.\u0026nbsp“The gas and oil is the bonus,” said Yusuf Erim, an analyst at TRT World, Turkey’s public broadcaster. “Number one is the national security advantages of being able to open up into the eastern Mediterranean.”Authorities in Tripoli initially refused to sign the deal, worried it would alienate potential allies in Europe, but gave in to Ankara’s request in November as Mr Haftar’s forces crept up on the capital.\u0026nbsp“They self-immolated themselves from a diplomatic perspective to save themselves militarily,” said Jalel Harchaoui, a north Africa specialist at the Clingendael Institute, a Dutch think tank.The deal gives Turkey a far greater stake in the events unfolding in Libya, which has strong historical ties to Anatolia. Fresh Turkish assistance to Libya could include anti-aircraft weaponry and jamming equipment to stop UAE-supplied combat and surveillance drones.\u0026nbsp“The priority is to help avoid the collapse of the GNA government in Tripoli,” said Mr Harchaoui. “It is about making sure the GNA doesn’t get toppled by Haftar and the UAE.”Open support for the Libyan government would also mark an escalatory challenge to the UAE, Russia and Egypt, which are providing\u0026nbsparms and fighters to Haftar, raising the stakes in any bid to take over western Libya.\u0026nbsp“Erdogan realised the clandestine space was overcrowded,” said Mr Harchaoui. “He thought he would get first-movers advantage by invading the official space.”Mr Erim acknowledged that any dispatch of Turkish troops to north Africa would test the limits of the armed forces.\u0026nbspSome Turkish voices have opposed the deal, which follows foreign military deployments to Syria and Qatar.\u0026nbsp“Turkey will end up facing General Haftar, France and Egypt,” said a commentary in the opposition Cumhuriyet newspaper. “Saudi Arabia is also playing a role behind the scenes, and there is no doubt that Russia is there as the biggest power.

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan. He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school.

I feel torn – from the joy at returning to my\u0026nbsploved ones and the heartache for those I\u0026nbsphad to leave behind. I am staring at my canvas camera bags, which sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world.\u0026nbspNow they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away…Here I have compiled a collection of photographs and memories, comprising the stories of some of the most marginalised children in the world.Winter: Abdul, a Syrian refugee aged 10, is seated in a makeshift shelter, perched high among\u0026nbspthe rugged snowy mountain caps of Arsal, Lebanon. He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child. I knew my turn would come Abdul knew his would not.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpring:\u0026nbspVenezuelan refugees who once ate together as families around their own tables\u0026nbspnow eat from rubbish bins on their hands and knees to survive the crisis in their country. All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize. Having never begged for food myself as a child, I could not begin to understand the internal dialogue in doing so. I knew I could simply open a fridge door\u0026nbspJoender\u0026nbspcan’t.Summer:\u0026nbspEsperence, aged 10, is a Haitian “restavek” or child slave. He was\u0026nbspgiven away by his biological parents to a more affluent household and\u0026nbspforced into a life of domestic servitude. The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face. Hours each day are spent cleaning, sweeping and washing.\u0026nbsp“I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbspNearly 260 million children aren’t in school – do we care?

However, I remember the luxury of choice: I knew I could say no. Esperence knows he cannot.\u0026nbspAutumn: Mamoke, aged 10, has never set foot in a classroom. Abandoned by her parents along with her siblings, she now lives with her grandmother at the mercy of abject poverty. In a dark room in remote north western Tanzania, she explains\u0026nbsphow not going to school saddens\u0026nbspher. But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life. Children around the world live with no access to healthcare, displaced from their home, going to sleep hungry, growing up in conflict and with no\u0026nbspeducation.I did not choose my career any more than I chose my life. It chose me, and it is the greatest privilege, a blessing and a burden in the same breath. I\u0026nbspwill continue to hold the world to account, hoping\u0026nbspit will eventually force the changes that will create better choices for those who deserve them.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But why is it being shted Normally the Early May bank holiday falls on the first Monday of May.But next year it wont be on May , it will be on Friday .The government announced the change of date in June to mark the th anniversary of VE Day.VE Day stands for Victory in Europe Day which took place on Tuesday, May , .It was the day on which allied forces announced the surrender of Germany in Europe.It marked the end of Adolf Hitler’s war and sparked celebrations around the world.The day before at .pm on May , , Germany had surrendered.Hitler had committed suicide a week earlier leaving Grand Admiral Donitz of the German army to admit defeat.The Normandy landings in June  had proved instrumental in achieving victory for the allies, as had the huge eastern offensives of the USSR.Six years of war that had cost the lives of millions had finally come to a close."},{"url":null,"title":"highs lows politics 2019 brexit","story":"But amid all the chaos and conniving,  had its comic moments in the ­corridors of power. Sunday Political Editor David Wooding hands out his annual gongs – The Wooders.Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson deluded herself she would be the next PM and toured the land in a coach bearing her giant mugshot on the side.But she didn’t even manage to win her own seat back.At least it cheered up the second most annoying party leader, the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon, who punched the air in glee at claiming her Scots rival’s scalp.You wait two years for a Labour star to jump ship — then he does it twice in a few weeks.Following his aborted leadership bid, Chuka Umunna launched a new party, Change UK.But he became so fond of change, he did it again and joined the Lib Dems.Now he’s coping with more change after voters booted him out.Expelled left-winger Derek Hatton is readmitted into the Labour Party after a -year wait — only to be kicked out again  hours later.Comeback king Nigel Farage launched the Brexit Party.But within hours, pranksters registered its email address as a porn site.He was swamped with offers from East European women offering a “stress-free” massage.Bet he needed a rub down after his party bombed in the election.John Bercow stood down as Commons Speaker after ten years and was then accused of demanding £million to appear on TV’s I’m A Celebrity.He denied the claims but Brexit-backing MPs would happily have paid Remainer Bercow handsomely to get him out of the Westminster jungle.Naughty-but-nice Trade Secretary Liz Truss attended The Big Sausage event in Norfolk, saying it was, “ticking rather a lot of my boxes”.Asked to try a Gloucester Old Spot banger, she enthused: “That’s one of the best offers I’ve had all year.”It perhaps explains why Liz enjoyed working in a well-hung Parliament so much.Housing minister James Brokenshire showed off his new kitchen which boasts FOUR matching ovens.The revelation must have left the PM wondering where to put his “oven-ready” Brexit deal.It prompted one stunned MP to ask: “Is he running a pizza business on the side ”A miserable year for Jeremy Corbyn as his party and football team tanked.After his election defeat, the Labour leader assured fellow Arsenal fans he wouldn’t be applying for the vacant job of Gunners team boss.Just as well, as he’d probably borrow £billion to buy more left wingers and strikers but remain neutral on whether to play in Europe.Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg was dubbed “insolent” and “insufferable” when he reclined almost horizontally on the Commons’ green benches during a late-night Brexit debate.He refused to budge, amid cries of, “Sit up, man!”But the posh wind-up merchant smiled and nodded when one angry MP sarcastically suggested he should be supplied with a pillow.Spoon-bending psychic Uri Geller vowed to use his “telepathic powers” to stop Jeremy Corbyn becoming PM.After the election, he claimed he influenced Boris Johnson’s landslide victory by giving him a spoon energised with “mind positivity”.Chris “Failing” Grayling quit as Transport Secretary after a string of Brexit planning blunders — including awarding a cross-Channel ferry contract to a firm with no ships.Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson shed st in two years by giving up sugar and taking up exercise.He became so thin that Corbynista “assassins” missed their target in a plot to oust him.Slimline Watson then decided to cast off his ­political baggage and quit as an MP.Shadow Education Secretary Angela ­Rayner has been showered with compliments about her figure after going on a “half-portions” diet.She quipped: “Fat birds don’t win elections.”Neither do slim turkeys when Corbyn is leader.Boris Johnson almost botched his leadership bid after a “screaming row” with his girlfriend over a wine stain on her sofa.Police were called by neighbours who reported “a lot of smashing” from the home he shared with Carrie Symonds.What happened next remains secret.Perhaps it was a ­cover-up — by an upholstery firm.Cops ordered a McDonald’s outlet to stop selling milkshakes during a rally by Nigel Farage in Edinburgh — in case they were used as missiles by customers.The Brexit Party boss completed the visit unscathed, only to be “milkshaked” in Newcastle.Loveable No pup Dilyn outshines ­Cameron, May, Johnson and even Larry the Downing Street cat.The seven-month-old Jack Russell-cross from an animal rescue charity moved in with BoJo’s girlfriend Carrie and always steals the show at official receptions.A real yappy ending.Hapless Karen Bradley admitted she didn’t believe a word she said as Northern Ireland Secretary.She dropped a clanger by saying that killings by the military and police during The Troubles were not crimes — then rowed back, insisting: “I want to be very clear. I do not believe what I said. That is not my view.”Boris Johnson brandished a kipper at his leadership hustings.But his claim that he couldn’t have it delivered by post because of EU rules proved very fishy.Channel  replaced no-shows Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage with melting ice sculptures during a debate on climate change.Viewers probably judged their performance to be less drippy than Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson’s.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was sacked after an inquiry into who leaked details of a National Security Council meeting over plans to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to help build Britain’s G network.Downing Street said the PM had, “lost confidence in his ability to serve”, but he soon ed to Cabinet.All sounds a bit, er, phoney.Boris likened himself to The Incredible Hulk as he vowed to break free from EU shackles.But when he showed schoolkids an image of the superhero during a school visit, a boy pointed at the huge muscles and said: “You’ve got boobies.”She failed to secure a Brexit deal and lost the Tories’ majority.Yet Theresa May soldiered on with everyone against her.When toppled, she didn’t quit Parliament in a huff or carp endlessly from the backbenches but showed more loyalty to her successor than he gave to her.Mrs May could prove to be the finest ex-PM Britain ever had.Remainer lawyer Gina Miller blew thousands trying to stop Brexit — but unwittingly helped deliver it.Her court victory gave Brexit-blocker MPs the right to vote down Theresa May’s “soft” departure deal.But it set off a chain of events that put Bojo in No with a majority big enough to force through a much cleaner Brexit. Thanks, Gina.They spent the past three and a half years plotting to stop Brexit at every turn.But at the General Election, voters sent them a clear message: Leave Parliament.So good riddance to Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry, David Gauke, Laura Pidcock, Chuka Umunna, Jo Swinson, Philip Lee, Antoinette Sandbach and Sam Gyimah. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Child mortality is at record low levels. Famine virtually went extinct. Malaria, polio and heart disease are declining.Ever since I wrote The Rational Optimist, in , I’ve been faced with, “what about. . . ” questions: What about the great recession, the euro crisis, Syria, Ukraine, Donald Trump  How can I possibly say that things are getting better, given all that The answer is: Because bad things happen while the world still gets better.That is to say, our population and economy would grow, but we would learn how to reduce what we take from the planet. And so it has proved.Scientist Andrew McAfee documented this in his book More From Less, showing how some nations are beginning to use less metal, less water and less land.This does not quite fit with what the Extinction Rebellion lot are telling us.But the next time you hear Sir David Attenborough say: “Anyone who thinks you can have infinite growth on a planet with finite resources is either a madman or an economist,” ask him this: “But whateconomic growth means using less stuff, not more ”For example, a drink can contains  grams of aluminium, much of it recycled. In  it contained  grams.Substituting the former for the latter is a contribution to economic growth, but it reduces the resources consumed per drink.As for Britain, our consumption of “stuff” probably peaked around the turn of the century. The evidence is there.In  Chris Goodall, an investor in electric vehicles, published research showing the UK was now using not just relatively less stuff every year, but absolutely less.Events have since vindicated his thesis. The quantity of all resources consumed per person in Britain fell by a third between  and , from . tonnes to . tonnes.That’s a faster decline than the increase in the number of people, so it means fewer resources consumed overall.Think about your own home. Mobile phones have the computing power of room-sized computers of the s. I use mine instead of a camera, radio, torch, compass, map, calendar, watch, CD player newspaper and a pack of cards.LED light bulbs consume about a quarter as much electricity as incandescent bulbs for the same light. Modern buildings generally contain less steel and more of it is recycled. Offices use much less paper.Even in cases when the use of stuff is not falling, it is rising more slowly than expected.For instance, how much water the world consumed in  was half as much as experts in the s predicted. Inventiveness allowed more efficient irrigation for agriculture, the biggest user of water.Until recently, most economists assumed these improvements were almost always in vain, becauseyou cut the cost of something, people would just use more of it. Make lights less energy hungry and people leave them on for longer.But Andrew McAfee argues that doesn’t hold up. Suppose you switch from incandescent to LED bulbs in your house and save about three-quarters of your electricity bill for lighting. You might leave more lights on for longer, but surely not four times as long.Efficiencies in agriculture mean the world is now approaching “peak farmland”. Despite the growing number of people and their demand for more and better food, the productivity of agriculture is rising so fast that human needs can be supplied by a shrinking amount of land.In , Jesse Ausubel, of The Rockefeller University in New York, and his colleagues argued that thanks to modern technology, we use  per cent less land to produce a given quantity of food compared with  years ago.By  it is estimated that an area the size of India will have been released from the plough and the cow.Perhaps the most surprising statistic is that Britain is using steadily less energy.John Constable, of the Global Warming Policy Forum think tank, points out that although the UK’s economy has almost trebled since , and our population is up by  per cent, energy consumption has fallen by almost ten per cent.This is not necessarily good news, Constable argues. Although the improving energy efficiency of light bulbs, planes and cars is part of the story, it also means we are importing more embedded energy in products, having driven much of our steel, aluminium and chemical industries abroad with some of the world’s highest energy prices.In fact, all this energy-saving might cause problems.Innovation requires experiments . Experiments require energy. So cheap energy is crucial.Thus, energy may be the one resource that a prospering population should be using more of.Since its inception, the environmental movement has been obsessed by finite resources. The two books that kicked off the green industry in the early s, The Limits To Growth, in America, and BlueprintFor Survival, in Britain, both lamented the imminent exhaustion of metals, minerals and fuels.The Limits To Growth predicted thatgrowth continued, the world would run out of gold, mercury, silver, tin, zinc, copper and lead well before . School textbooks soon echoed these claims.This caused the economist Julian Simon to challenge the ecologist Paul Ehrlich to a bet that five metalswould cost less in  than in .The Stone Age did not end for lack of stone, Simon said, arguing that we would find substitutesmetals grew scarce.Simon won the bet easily, and Ehrlich sniped that: “The one thing we’ll never run out of is imbeciles.”To this day, none of those metals has signicantly risen in price nor run out. A modern irony is that many green policies advocated now would actually reverse the trend towards using less stuff.A wind farm requires far more concrete and steel than a system based on gas. Environmental opposition to nuclear power has hindered the generating system that needs the least land, least fuel and least steel or concrete per megawatt.Burning wood instead of coal in power stations means the exploitation of more land — and even higher emissions. Organic farming uses more land than conventional methods.Technology has put us on a path to a cleaner, greener planet. We don’t need to veer in a new direction. To do so risks retarding progress.As we enter the third decade of this century, I’ll make a prediction.By the end of it we will see less poverty, less child mortality, less land devoted to agriculture.There will be more tigers, whales, forests and nature reserves. Britons will be richer and each of us will use fewer resources.The global political future may be uncertain, but the environmental and technological trends are pretty clear — and pointing in the right direction. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Employers such as the MoD and the NHS had said they were safe.But it simply wasn’t true . . . and at least  rogue operators were free to roam in a “scammer’s paradise”.To add insult to injury, the victims — some of whom have reported feeling suicidal — are now being fined for unknowingly participating in these schemes, which broke tax laws.And who’s to blame  Tony Blair and his Labour government, who relaxed rules around HMRC enrolment in , allowing dodgy pension schemes to sign up with virtually no checks.This was supposed to bring “security, dignity and comfort in old age”. Instead it has unleashed a nightmare.Perhaps instead of lecturing us on Brexit, Blair should reflect on his devastating legacy.IN her bid to become the next Labour leader, Rebecca Long-Bailey has promised “progressive patriotism”.It sounds as nonsensical as the party’s economic policies. After all, there’s nothing “progressive” about this vile, anti-semitic version of the party.Nor is there anything “patriotic” about Long-Bailey’s loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn, the man who counts Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA as his friends.So it comes as no surprise that Corbyn’s cronies are apparently trying to shorten the Labour leadership contest in order to boost Long-Bailey’s chances and “stitch-up” other hopefuls.Her proclamation of patriotism shows utter desperation.Labour spent years treating anyone who’s proud to be British as lowle scum, only to have that backfire on them at the election.Many are proud of this country and enthusiastic about Brexit.It’s a bit too late for Corbynistas to pretend they feel the same.IT looks set to be a very happy New Year for many British workers.Chancellor Sajid Javid has announced that the minimum wage for over s will rise by p to £. an hour in April.After years of “Spreadsheet Phil” Hammond and his Brexit fearmongering, this is exactly the boost Britain needs — both for the economy and spirit.So let’s join the three million who’ll be toasting Mr Javid on New Year’s Eve. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Things can only improve on the last four years of anger, ision and political paralysis.A period which should have been pivotal to our country saw it barely governed at all.

That wages must be driven up and food banks rendered redundant.That the Tories must continue striving for a cleaner environment without ­caving in to economy-wrecking panic.And we of course share the desire for a kinder, more united country — echoed by the open letter from faith, ­culture, sport and business leaders.The Sun is optimistic about that too.In fact we do not agree we have suffered a “decade of ision”. Yes, it was tough financially. But we were far from ided at, say, the  Olympics.The anger in our Parliament, offices, factories and homes was caused by Brexit, specically by some Remainers’ refusal to accept defeat, and by a Labour Party engulfed by the hostile hard-left.The Brexit heat is fast dissipating now. Boris’s triumph saw to that. Many Remainers are making their peace with it . . . and even seeing its opportunities.Which leaves but one obstacle to the national healing.No one has done more to ide us than Jeremy Corbyn, his thuggish, often anti-Semitic followers and his obnoxious media apologists.Their relentless hatred and dishonest demonisation of opponents toxied both political discourse and Labour’s election fortunes.Yet none of the contenders to replace Corbyn grasps this reality: They can remain a Twitter-obsessed, Tory-hating clique of middle-class Marxist posers calling each other “comrade” but disconnected from working people.Or be viable, mainstream contenders for Government.

Whichever box we ticked in the election, millions of us vote green with our lestyles.A recent survey of Sun readers showed  per cent recognise climate change is real and that  per cent of us worry more about our environmental impact now than they did five years ago.And  per cent of Sun readers want to make their habits greener still.Some of them make their voices heard.Retired receptionist Eileen Webster, , says “climate change is the big issue facing the next generation”, while Anna Lubecka, , demands new PM Boris Johnson, “start making good plans for climate change”.Attitudes to environmentalism have shted so much that being green is now no longer the preserve of lentil-munching hippies and Swampy, it is totally mainstream.No trendy bar would now dare put plastic straws in their cocktails.We’ve all got used to carrying Love Island-style water bottles and happily adopted reusable coffee cups. This year they pulled off a plastic-free Glastonbury, despite a few hiccups.We’ve long stopped grumbling about taking our own bags to the supermarket and got used to stuffing our pockets with them when we leave the house.So now in England, the average person uses less than a tenth of the number of single-use plastic bags than we did five years ago. Only around ten a year, compared to  in .As electric cars have improved, we’ve all been seduced — and not just by Tesla’s new “bulletproof” Cybertruck. Overall, demand for electric cars has jumped, with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders finding that this November alone electric car sales leaped by . per cent, with more than three times as many new battery-electric vehicles registered as in the same month in .Nowhere  is it clearer that green has become the new black than in fashion, where criticism of fast fashion has led to trends for vintage, second hand and renting rather than buying.On the high street, companies such as HM have launched their “conscious collection” , fashion bible Vogue has championed sustainable designs, while French President Emmanuel Macron’s “fashion pact” — presented at the G summit and intended to make the industry more sustainable — has been signed by more than  brands, including Nike, Zara and Gap.All these changes prove how far we have come and the impact Greta has had.Hearing her, strong and calm, on Radio ’s Today programme this week, what struck me is that now another change is needed.This time a sht not in our actions, but in how we approach the environmental debate.It’s not beliefs but attitudes that need to change. Until now, environmental issues have been too isive.Butwe want real change we’ve got to move beyond blame.It puts people off environmental issues when campaigners hector and shame them.When wealthy celebrities such as Sir David Attenborough criticise normal people for taking holidays with cheap flights, or actress Emma Thompson jets back from America to harass normal people driving to work.In the same way Extinction Rebellion threatens to lose potential supporters when it starts fights with commuters trying to board their morning train or cause mayhem in central London.The real danger is that by being so aggressive, these green campaigners risk putting people off.Greta seems to know this. She is much calmer than she used to be when speaking in public.Rather than getting angry or emotional, instead she has stressed the importance of just, “listening to the scientists”.As usual, we could learn from her.The reality is most people want to be green.We are all concerned about global warming, pollution in the seas and the kind of planet we are creating for our grandkids. But you can’t shame people into doing something.Diesel drivers — especially White Van Man — shouldn’t be harassed just for getting to work. I’m sure they would buy more environmentally friendly vehiclesthey could afford to.Likewise, no one should be shamed for taking a flight — who knows what other measures they might be taking, such as living in a carbon neutral home What the planet needs least is more fighting.

We need contact — and not just emotional — but physical.There’s even a psychological term for it, skin hunger.People are responding to this tech-driven disconnect by seeking out physical contact in any way they can.The most obvious example is the rise of hugging.There’s a lot more hugging as a greeting between men than there used to be, even between sporting opponents.And what on earth happened to the stand-offish Brits  Great British Bake Off contestants spend nearly as much time holding hands and wrapping their arms around each other as they do baking.We have become so hungry for touch that we don’t even need a human partner.The odds are that someone you know will have received a weighted blanket for Christmas.It is essentially a duvet cover filled with plastic or glass pellets or beads.Manufacturers say the even pressure they exert on your body promotes the release of well-being chemical serotonin and sleep hormone melatonin, while reducing stress-related hormone cortisol.In plain language we’re talking about feeling the comfort and security of being cradled, evenit’s by a blanket rather than in the arms of a loved one.For those who want to take the experience of being hugged to a whole new level, Otonamaki, the Japanese practice of adult swaddling, will become popular in .After getting into a foetal position, the client is bound tightly in sheets, then gently rocked for  minutes.I ran across a tweet not long ago that read: “My phone just said, ‘Welcome home’, and I instinctively replied, ‘I love you’. Then I realised I meant it.”We may be interacting with our fellow humans less often, but we’re more than making up for it with digital interactions, even to the point of developing feelings for these devices.As our devices get smarter and master the intricacies of natural language processing, we will increasingly see them as confidants, friends and even romantic partners.Already people are interacting with chatbots instead of flesh-and-blood therapists.And we’re seeing all sorts of digital apps promising to improve our mental health, from Moodfit and MoodMission to Happy.As developers figure out how to make our smart devices ever more personable, it doesn’t take a soothsayer to recognise that a global population increasingly suffering from loneliness and disconnectedness will find solutions of a sort in these gadgets.The desire for clean air in cities will not only lead to pricier houses on less polluted streets but tourists will give up city breaks for holidays in the country, where the air is good.As living in places with clean air becomes a luxury with a high price tag, expect new takes on face masks to become a must-have item for people in cities and a race towards rural living.Expect an explosion of products, from vegan leather to plant-based burgers and articial wood.If you buy a vegan burger and cook it at home, you have consumed a burger made with eight times less water and CO than a conventional beef burger.These sorts of products may be described as “fake” but the feelings people get of having made an ethically better choice are very real.Uncertainty begets fear, so look out for a rise in preppers — survivalists preparing for Armageddon.In the US, prepping is mainstream enough for Costco to sell a £, one-year stockpile of survival food for four.Survivalists are at the extreme end of the bunker trend.More mainstream are the millions who aren’t worried enough to go all-out prepper but still view the outside world as a threat.Driven by concerns about personal security and terrorism, CCTV covering public and commercial spaces is becoming a global norm.London is sixth in the world for TV surveillance, the only non-Chinese city in the top eight.And sales of home video surveillance on smartphones, courtesy of Google Nest, Ring and Wyze Cam, are booming.The global market is expected to rise from £billion to £billion by .Expect the self-tracking trend to run and run.For more and more people, there’s something irresistible about gadgets that put statistics to common everyday activities.For things that can’t yet be tracked automatically, they can input data manually — MyMoodTracker for emotions, MyNetDiary for nutrition and PoopLog for toilet visits.Google announced it intended to buy Fitbit for nearly £billion, prompting some to say they will ditch their device out of concern that Google will sell their health data to insurance companies.But rather than wait to buy third-party data, insurance companies are already getting into the game.: Single, professional women will become the new free-spending yuppies.: Publishes a study of the soft modern male, who she described as “metrosexual man”.: Predicts “sleep is the new sex” and “clean eating”.

Qassim Soleimani.The powerful leader of Irans elite Quds Force was targeted as he plotted an attack on American diplomats, according to the Pentagon.His death will be seen as a huge blow to Iran and will further raise tensions with the United States.In a chilling response, Irans foreign minister, Javad Zar, called the strike an act of international terrorism.He wrote on Twitter: The US act of international terrorism, targeting  assassinating General Soleimani—THE most effective force fighting Daesh , Al Nusrah, Al Qaeda et al—is extremely dangerous  a foolish escalation.The US bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism.Responding to the news of Soleimanis death, President Donald Trump had struck a patriotic tone by posting a single image of the American flag on Twitter.The strike came after days of tense civil unrest in the Iraqi capital - where militias backed by Tehran have been blamed for laying siege to the US embassy.A statement released by the Pentagon said: “General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more.”It continued: This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans. The United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the world.”The statement added that the strike was carried out at the direction of the president.The death of Soleimani was also confirmed by a senior militia leader in Iraq, who spoke to Iraqi and Lebanese television.It was also reported Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of the Iran-backed militia know as the Popular Mobilization Forces, or PMF, was killed in the strike.President Trump has been using a maximum pressure campaign against Iran, which has moved on from economic sanctions to military activity.The strike on Soleimani came just days after supporters of an Iran-backed Iraqi militia, Kataib Hezbollah, besieged the American embassy in Baghdad.That came after the US carried out strikes on the militia in Iraq and Syria.On Thursday, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper warned the United States military would pre-emptively strike Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syriathere were signs the paramilitary groups were planning more attacks against American bases and personnel in the region.A senior Iraqi politician and high-level security official, speaking to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said al-Muhandis had arrived to the airport in a convoy to receive Soleimani, whose plane had arrived from either Lebanon or Syria.The American drone strike saw multiple missiles hit two cars carrying Gen. Suleimani and several officials with Iranian-backed militias as they were leaving the airport.The strike was carried out by the Joint Special Operation Command.The senior Iraqi politician said Soleimanis body was identied by the ring he wore.Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren revealed her thoughts on the growing tensions in the region through a statement on Twitter.She wrote: Soleimani was a murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans. But this reckless move escalates the situation with Iran and increases the likelihood of more deaths and new Middle East conflict. Our priority must be to avoid another costly war.Soleimani had been rumored dead several times, including in a  airplane crash that killed other military officials in northwestern Iran and following a  bombing in Damascus that killed top aides of embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad.More recently, rumours circulated in November  that Soleimani was killed or seriously wounded leading forces loyal to Assad as they fought around Syrias Aleppo.The killing of General Suleimani is a major blow for Iran.American officials consider General Suleimani, the commander of the Revolutionary Guards’ elite Quds Force, responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American soldiers during the Iraq War and hostile Iranian activities throughout the Middle East.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As almost the first act of the new Tory Government, flexing the muscles of its new -seat majority, protections for child refugees built into the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill were dropped, along with protections for British workers. Since , the rights of child ­refugees to join relatives in another EU country have been protected by a bill that said these rights would continue after Brexit . But four days before Christmas, the Government amended Clause  of the EU Withdrawal Bill. Now ­ministers will just have to give “a statement to Parliament”. Next week, MPs willto vote on the amended bill, which sets out the terms of the transition period as we prepare to leave the EU. When they do, they should listen to the words of Lord Alf Dubs, the Labour peer who came to Britain aged six in , who was among , children saved from the Nazis by the Kindertransport evacuations. “To all those MPs who will vote this week, I want to want to say that Britain has an honourable humanitarian tradition when it comes to child ­refugees,” former MP Lord Dubs, now , says. “It is a shocking, shocking thing to deny them safety. I would urge you to speak out and say as a country, we are better than this.” As millions of us spent New Year’s Day eating Quality Street and watching the Von Trapps escape the Nazis over the Austrian mountains, there will have been children taking that same desperate route through the ­mountains of Europe. “This was a bombshell,” Lord Dubs says. “It wasn’t in the manesto. There is no electoral mandate for it.” In , Lord Dubs’ campaigning led to legislation known as the Dubs Amendment, which hoped to get safe passage for unaccompanied child refugees during the migrant crisis.  “Back then, there were Tory MPs and even some government ministers who would tell me to keep going, but the mood and composition of the Government has changed,” he says. “This tells me we had better be careful about where government goes next.” Alf Dubs was six when the Nazis took over his home city of Prague. “I have bits of memory,” he says. “I remember at school we had to tear out the picture of the Czech President Benes and paste in a picture of Adolf Hitler. There were German soldiers everywhere. “My father was Jewish and so he left first. His cousins decided to stay and in  they were sent to Auschwitz. I remember being at the station in Prague waiting for the Kindertransport, German soldiers everywhere, but I was too young to feel real danger.” The train was one of eight from Prague to London organised by British hero Nicholas Winton, whom the Mirror awarded a Pride of Britain letime achievement award to in . Winton’s trains saved  children from the Nazi death camps.  “It was such a long train journey, two days, and then we reached the Dutch border and the older children cheered because they knew we were safe,” Lord Dubs says. “We went by boat from the Hook of Holland to Harwich and then to Liverpool Street. I was lucky – my father had got to the UK. “My mother was trying to leave but she couldn’t get an exit permit. At Gestapo headquarters, officials threw her down the stairs. She landed in a heap but they threw her passport after her. She was able to escape, and arrived in London the day before Germany invaded Poland.” Soon after, his father died of a heart attack, and his mother was ­scrubbing floors in a Manchester restaurant. Their son was made a Lord in .  After a letime of campaigning for the rights of other refugee children, Lord Dubs recently visited the camps of northern France and the Greek islands. “The conditions are shocking in Greece,” he says. “And it is worse in Calais now than in the time of the Jungle, because the police are taking their tents and sleeping bags. Families are just living under tarpaulins. ­ Children are vulnerable and in danger. “If you take away people’s legal path to safety, they are more likely to look at other dangerous ways of getting across the Channel – whether that’s on the back of a lorry or an unsafe dinghy.” "},{"url":null,"title":"big business casting doubt boris","story":"NewsBig business casting doubt on Boris Johnsons claim  will be fantasticThe UK economy ended  in stagnation - and business leaders are predicting \"protacted weakness\" across the economyShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  JAN News \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - politicsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

It’s also a crying shame. Yvette is one of the few grown-ups we’ve got left – she’s probably our best chance.” "},{"url":null,"title":"british teenager convicted lying gang","story":"NewsBritish teenager convicted of lying about gang rape in Cyprus should be pardonedThe teenager, convicted of lying about being gang-raped by  Israeli men in Ayia Napa, could bring a case to the European Court of Human Rights and lawyers say the case reeks of unfairnessShareByAndy Lines:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video cyprus-court-finds-british-teenager-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news british-teenager-convicted-lying-gang-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades has been urged to allow the -year-old tohere as soon as possible without a stain on her character. Earlier this week the woman, who has not been identied, was convicted of “causing public mischief”. She faces being jailed for a year when she is sentenced on Tuesday. But protests have been growing over the case. Achilleas Demetriades, a top human rights lawyer, said: “Authorities should absolutely consider a pardon.” Commercial lawyer Elena Ioannides said the Cypriot legal profession was “very surprised and disappointed that the case has got this far”. Several senior legal figures in Cyprus have written a letter to the country’s attorney-general asking him to intervene. In England, Kirsty Brimelow, QC, said the case “reeks of unfairness”. She said the teenager could bring a case to the European Court of Human Rights. Jonathan Cooper, a human rights barrister, said she had “very good grounds for an appeal”. A crowdfunding appeal set up to pay legal fees has hit £,. The woman claimed she was raped by  Israeli men in Ayia Napa last July. She withdrew the allegation under what she says was an eight-hour police interview with no lawyer present.

Daniel Patrick,  and his partner Katy, , say the back garden is a no-go area at the property they bought off-plan from Persimmon homes in Redditch, Worcestershire, in August . The couple, who have two children, say they were so excited to get into the house that they didnapost notice any faults at their home at first. However it wasnapost long before their downstairs loo began flooding with raw sewage any time they flushed the toilet downstairs. The couple say the back garden also floods with rain water - and that the builders confessed there was no external drainage system fitted to their home. On top of that, they also claim they later discovered that the drains had been backing up into their washing machine so they had been cleaning the familyaposs clothes in raw sewage water. After three neighbours complained of the same problem, Daniel now says that pipework has been completed - but just causes waste from three other homes to gather in their garden. Daniel, an IT manager, said: Since moving in we have had raw sewage in our property twice. Within a few days of moving in I approached the site staff with my concerns regarding the rear garden, my concerns were ignored and I was told it was due to the drains having to be completed.  The first time was last year Christmas none of our toilets would flush and waste was coming up into the downstairs toilet and into the room itself. The second time, around February, Persimmon acknowledged there was an issue and someone was sent out, both times tools were found in the drains that we left over from the build. The dog walked it through the house and I tried to claim for cleaning and replacing carpets and they said no- in the end we have had to replace all the downstairs with laminate flooring in case it happens again. On top of everything the pair say they were told by plumbers sent by Persimmon that water waste was due to a faulty washing machine- Daniel and Katie quickly replaced it but the problem happened again.  He added: He came and said, it has nothing to do with the drainage and weaposd need a new washing machine- we had to spend £ on a new washing machine and there was still waste coming out. What we also found out was that we had been washing our clothes in excrement- the pipes would back up with the human waste -not only ourselves but the next door neighbours as well - and would go back into the washing machine. Myself, my partner and my two children were walking around in clothes washed in waste water.  We have two young children, we have lived in this house for  months, we have had raw sewage coming from the downstairs bathroom-our children came home from school finding excrement all over our house. When we noty them we were told itaposs not an emergency. During an inspection for the drainage system, carried out by M.V Kelly, the grounds contractor of Persimmon, on May , that Daniel and Katy requested it discovered there was no pipes in any garden on the site at all.  Daniel said: Our neighbour has had four gangs of workers in two weeks due to them walking of site due to the apospoor conditionsapos -it appears what has made ours especially bad is the fact that were not only at the bottom of the hill, but no initial inspections of the ground were carried out and that only having dug our neighbours garden up have they found a pre-existing land drain coming from the top of the site feeding water into our garden. Now that drain is fed into four drains in our neighbouraposs garden which in turn is fed into our garden, so water is pouring out and just sat in our garden, we simply cannot use the garden. We are looking for some answers and we still havenapost got any- whataposs going to happen next  "},{"url":null,"title":"first picture mum three teacher","story":"NewsFirst picture of mum-of-three teacher who was stabbed to death with her loverPictured for the first time, Helen Almey was said by friends to have only recently found happiness again after her split from husband Rhys Hancock before she was killed at her home along with her boyfriendShareByMartin Fricker:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN News\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - daily newsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Zoo spokesperson Phil Knowling said: “Lucer was  years old, so he was a good age for an Asiatic lion. He was, like a lot of us, showing signs of wear and tear on his body. He had some weakness and ataxia – that’s wobbliness in his hind limbs – he would stagger occasionally, especially when going up and down steps, and often stumble.” Senior mammal keeper Helen Neighbour added: “He was a lovely male lion – in that he was grumpy and bad tempered, but not too much.  He always liked to have the last word. He was a great dad and a lovely animal to work with - he was smart enough to train, so we could vaccinate him easily. Us keepers will miss him terribly.” Paignton Zoo had been monitoring and assessing Luceraposs condition for some time. They came to the conclusion that he was suffering and the best thing for him was to put him to sleep.

It is claimed “powerful friends” are protecting the British socialite alleged to have been Jeffery Epstein’s madam. The FBI want to investigate her friendship with the late paedophile but Maxwell, , appears to have vanished. The daughter of shamed pub­­lisher Robert Maxwell holds information on the rich and famous and has long been rumoured to have acted with spy agencies.

She has vowed to “take down the %” who think they are above the law and make  “a year to be remembered”. Andrew has strenously denied all the claims. Maxwell has been accused in several lawsuits of procuring underage girls for Epstein to traffick among his wealthy and powerful friends. She has also strenously denied any wrongdoing. But since the accusations emerged in  she has become a recluse, shunning the parties she was once a staple of. And, after Epstein’s August jail suicide, sources close to her claim she being protected. The New York Post source said: “She and Jeffrey were assets of sorts for multiple foreign governments.  “They would trade information about the powerful people in his net. She is not in the US, she moves around. She is sometimes in the UK but most often in other countries, such as Israel, where powerful contacts have provided her with safe houses and protection.” We previously revealed how Epstein kept meticulous diaries on the power-ful men who enjoyed his hospitality.

The Monarch spends the special day in Sandringham each year as part of her Christmas break, remaining at the Norfolk estate until the beginning of February. She puts out an open invitation to all members of the Royal Family to join her for the celebrations, and it’s often those who weren’t able to be there for Christmas Day who take up the offer. This year we know that the Cambridges are skipping the party as they are reportedly celebrating with Kate’s family, and Meghan and Harry are in Canada with their son Archie. However it’s likely that Prince Philip will be at her side having been released from hospital, where he was being treated for a “pre-existing condition” a few days before Christmas. Previous reports suggest that members of the family don’t go to bed until the Queen does, which means she basically gets to decide when the festivities end.  Queen’s former private secretary William Heseltine has previously confirmed this, saying: “Nobody felt it right to go to bed before the Queen did.” On New Year’s Day the Queen goes to church with members of the family. The Queen normally attends church on New Year’s Day before spending the afternoon relaxing, often going horse riding. The Monarch will stay in Sandringham until early February, preferring to mark the anniversary of her father’s death there rather than at Buckingham Palace.

Louise Thorell, , from Ashington, Northumberland, was always self conscious about the scar on her face left behind from when she battled chicken pox, aged five, but thought it was harmless. But in  the scaraposs appearance started to change, and after after having series of infections, she was referred for tests by her doctor, before being rocked by the news she had skin cancer. She is now cancer free after having three surgeries to remove it which have left her with a scar on her face. Louise explained: It felt tougher, waxier than my normal skin. Around that time, I accidentally scratched my scar and after that I had issues. It would heal, a scab would form, it would fall off and an open wound would be there until a new scab would form.  I dealt with it for a few months until I got an infection. My undereye swelled and my wound site got bigger each time it would open and heal again. I got two infections in it and an infection in my nose and above my lip too. After the first infection I noticed it had changed in appearance. It had tiny little blood vessel veins around it. Louise feared the worst after going for test because thereaposs a history of skin cancer in her family. Her grandmother Lillian, who had passed away in  from lung cancer, had suffered with a melanoma on the right side of her face. She said: My Nana had melanoma on the left side of her face, pretty much the same place - mine was on my right side. I googled skin cancers as I had a feeling my scar wound had turned sinister.  I made an appointment with my doctor and was referred very quickly to the melanoma clinic in Cramlington Northumberland, which is run by doctors and nurses from Newcastle RVI hospital. When the results came back, Louise was hit with the devastating news that she had developed Basal Cell Carcinoma , a common type of skin cancer, which can be non fataltreated early. The most common cause of BCC is from overexposure to ultraviolet light, usually found on sunbeds. Louise was stunned by the diagnosis as she claims she had never used sun bedsShe also insists she makes sure she applies sun cream to her pale skin in hot weather .In November , Louise had a procedure which left her with a visible scar on her face that required corrective surgery to improve it.  She said: I had Mohs surgery. I was awake for the surgery, just under local anaesthetic. They take some of the cancer cells away. Then itaposs tested and looked under the microscope to seethere are still cancer cells in a certain section. After the first time they took cells away, I was bandaged up and was told to go for lunch and a drink and come back in two hours to seethey got all the cancer first time. Unfortunately, they hadnapost. I had to go back in theatre and get more taken off. This happened a total of three times. Three times they had to go back on my face and take cells tumour away.. At first I wasnapost expecting the sheer size of my scar to be as big as it is. I did feel awful about how I looked. I tried to joke about it and make fun to lighten my mood. This lasted a few weeks. When I started to see it healing, my goodness, my spirits were lted. I had plastic restorative surgery the same day on my face. Now I am very, very aware of my skin. I religiously apply Biooil twice daily, I put face cream on first thing in the morning and last thing at night. I donapost scrub my face, I take extra care and time on my face now.

draw at Tannadice showed exactly why Dundee United are where they are.The Dark Blues probably were the better team in the end and they’ll take plenty of positives out of it but it was a good result for the Tangerines, too.I agree with manager Robbie Neilson saying his side didn’t play as well as they could have.For some reason, they looked a bit anxious and nervy in the second half which is completely unlike them.United had done so well in the previous derbies and been so assured it was a surprise to see them just lump the ball forward as the game wore on.However, the sign of a title-winning team is they can still take a point despite not playing well against one of the better sides in the ision.And they even extended their lead at the top as, once more, the other sides failed to take advantage of United dropping points.For James and his side, they were far better than previous derby showings, that much is obvious.It was a step forward for them and will give their fans a positive jolt heading into the new year.I still think they have problems creating chances.They had lots of good play in the second half but still can’t convert that into clear-cut opportunities.Look at the stats and, though Dundee about edged the game for me, United still had more shots on goal.I do think the way the Dens gaffer has set up his team recently suits them better and that showed on Friday night.There’s more balance in the midfield with Fin Robertson and Graham Dorrans taking turns to control things in the middle.It’s taken a while, which is understandable given the big changes in the summer, but James is starting to find a good formation and his best starting XI.These things always take time but it seems like the Dee are getting there.The key is they kick on from here.For United, it’s about ticking over and keeping themselves well clear of any trouble at the top.Sounds like there were a fair few interested parties at the derby, no doubt taking a look at Lawrence Shankland after his goalscoring exploits this season.It wouldn’t surprise methose English clubs were keeping an eye on Robertson and Dorrans either, the way those two are performing."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united right to call out racism","story":"Watching the derby on TV there were a few times I thought things might spill over from the stands.I wasn’t expecting any alleged racism to come out from the any part of the support, however, as appears to be the case from a video that has emerged.I think Dundee United have handled it in the right way, calling it out strongly.There’s no place for any sort of racism at football – or anywhere  for that matter."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49321140-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49321140-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49321140-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.49321140-1-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"goldfish called harry and meghan among oddest items left behind at dundee hotels","story":"A pair of goldfish named after the Earl and Countess of Dumbarton are among the most bizarre items left behind in a chain of Dundee hotels.Hotel firm Travelodge has issued the list of the oddest things guests have forgotten after checking out from its three Dundee hotels in .Alongside the pair of goldfish named after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle # better known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex # guests have also left a family tree, a #lucky# cricket bat and an entire suitcase of miniature whiskies.Overnight guests at the hotels have also left behind handwritten wedding vows # hopefully replaced # and, in a find that is perfect for Dundee, a Dennis the Menace Costume.A forgetful florist has even left an entire flower arch, while a well-off writer has left a Mont Blanc fountain pen worth hundreds of pounds.A would-be Adrian Mole left behind #a series of diaries belonging to a teenager#, and Travelodge even says a #BMW car# has been left by a guest.

They have been very good this season, picking up points and had been on a little run up until last Saturday.“I keep repeating myself to everybody but it is only about us and what we do because we can’t affect anybody ’s results, we need to keep plugging away ourselves like we have been doing.“Last Friday was a bit more positive compared with the previous two derbies – I think we learned from those games.“As a group we are all learning together and getting better. I think that is starting to show on the pitch.“Looking back over the past few weeks, at the time you want three points at Arbroath but, in hindsight, it was a decent point in hard conditions.“They are no mugs and showed that at the weekend again.“We went into Dunfermline and Partick and picked up two positive results but we are taking it a game at a time, maintaining our focus and working hard.“That’s all we can do, trust the management and then trust what we can do on the pitch.“We had so many bodies coming in during the summer, a massive turnover and that always takes a little while.“The manager has changed things, formations, tactics, and I do feel we are starting to click a bit better.“It’s only positive right now for us and we need to keep our head down. We can only do our job and not bother about other teams in the league.”Skipper Meekings and his team-mates took a lot out of the - draw at leaders Dundee United, particularly after going behind so early.“We showed a lot of character and dug in last Friday,” he added.“We’d been behind before in derbies and obviously suffered after that but this time we showed a bit of character and got back into it in the second half.“I think the last  minutes we gave it our all but couldn’t quite get that second goal.“It’s a good point on the road after a good period where we have picked up some points.“We had a sticky period and we’ve got out of it.“It was dficult at Tannadice the previous time so it is a bit more positive.”The -year-old, however, admits he feared the Dark Blues could have been in for another long night at Tannadice after Nicky Clark nipped in front of him to score after five minutes.A few choice words at half-time, though, brought out much better from Dundee in the second period.“When you are a centre-half and an early goal goes in against you, you think ‘we’ve got it all to do now’.“The boys dug deep, we all got stuck in – there was a bit said at half-time between the players and we needed that.“Moving forward, we need that drive and energy because it is a long season still – we are only halfway done and there is plenty to play for.”Meekings was also pleased to be able to give the club’s fans a cheerier festive period after a pretty gloomy .He added: “Hopefully, we gave our fans a decent Christmas and they could enjoy the New Year a bit more.“We would have loved to have given them three points but I think we showed passion and did everything we could last Friday.“We couldn’t quite get that second goal but it is a positive result.“If you show energy and passion like that, the fans will respond.“We wanted the three points but the derby was a positive point and the fans kept backing us.“We’ll keep fighting for them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users to ensure the wellbeing and successful future of the eagles in the south of Scotland and to secure its place for the future.Those who have participated in the initiative, ranging from four-years-old up to , come from a range of backgrounds and organisations, including the UKrsquos first ever Golden Eagle Scout Champions at the Scottish Borders Scouts, over  pupils from primary schools across the south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca Osowska, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos chief executive, said: ldquoThis is a fantastic milestone.\"Golden eagles are such an amazing part of Scotlandrsquos bioersity, and an integral part of building a nature-rich country for us all.\"Wersquore passionate about ing golden eagles to places where they used to be plentul ndash and it looks like we have thousands of people on our side!\"A huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow  Kirkhope Primary Schools, said: ldquoWe were really excited to be one of the first schools to take part in the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos Eagle Schools initiative.\"It really brought our community together and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.\"The children have had the most amazing experience.\"We are incredibly proud of the interest our pupils have shown in protecting this majestic and important bird. We look forward to supporting the project to make sure that Golden Eagles flourish in the south of Scotland.Project partners include RSPB Scotland, Scottish Land  Estates, Scottish Forestry, Scottish Natural Heritage, and the Southern Uplands Partnership.Funded by The National Lottery Heritage Fund, project partners, Scottish Power Renewables, the Scottish Government and local LEADER Programmes, the initiative is a key project under the Scottish Governmentrsquos  Challenge for Scottish Bioersity."},{"url":null,"title":"melrose-sevens-bosses-make-u-turn-road-closure","story":"BOSSES at Melrose Rugby have made a U-turn on their plans to close off St Marys Road during next years sevens.As previously reported, the stretch was due to be shut for two weeks ndash to allow for a temporary stand to be erected.But following discussions with the towns community council, chiefs running the four-day tournament have changed their minds.Now St Marys road will only be partially closed on game days, with a traffic light system in place.Philip Morris, sevens tournament director at Melrose Rugby, said: ldquoAn event like this one will of course come with an element of disruption to the usual routine.\"The Melrose community has embraced the sevens every year, however, concerns around an expanded event are of course completely understandable.\"For the avoidance of doubt, wersquore working really hard to support local businesses as suppliers to the event.\"And wersquoll also be consulting with local residents to address any specic concerns they have too.\"We are confident the economic boost to Melrose and the surrounding Borders towns during the expanded sevens event will be huge.\"News of the U-turn has been welcomed by members of Melrose Community Council.Chairman William Windram said: \"I still think the plans are a bit fluid at the moment, and I think there is still a lot of work going on behind the scenes.\"There are, however, still some issues like late night noise that have not been considered yet, but we have asked them [the club] to come back to our meeting in February to give us an update.\"Some amelioration has certainly taken place and we should be pleased.\"One of the concerns raised by Melrose Community Council at its November meeting was the impact the tournament would have on churchgoers ndash with the event taking place over the Easter weekend.In response, Mr Morris said: \"We are working hard to ensure the important Easter Sunday church service is not impacted and people will be able to get to and from the church without signicant disruption.\"Now the traffic situation on St Marys Road is becoming clearer, we have a plan that we feel will satisfy our local residents.

Among the steps being considered is the creation of a -space car park between Woodbush and Church Street.Furthermore, the councilrsquos transportation team is looking at the possibility of extending the car park at the railway station, which has  spaces, while potentially putting time restrictions on the car park at Abbeylands, which is home to more than  spaces.A planning application for the new car park, which would be accessed by Lamer Street and Woodbush, has been submitted by the local authority to its own planning department.The car park, which is described as being on land adjacent to the Coastguard Cottages, could also provide parking for the nearby Assembly Rooms, which have long been earmarked for development.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: ldquoThe proposed car park is promoted to meet demand and to compensate for future road space enhancement within Dunbar town centre. It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets.

Marcela looked at them again. ldquoOh, what are they then Her father took them and went to her wheelchair. He connected them to the front wheels of the chair.ldquoThey are wheelchair skis, he said, ldquoI made them. Marcela was overwhelmed.Within ten minutes, Marcela was wrapped up and ready to go out. She nervously wheeled her chair onto the snow covered front path. Usually the wheels would stick within seconds, but this time her chair slid effortlessly along the path.Soon she had got the hang of manoeuvring the chair in the snow. She had snow ball fight and was able to spin around and chase her schoolmates while storing lots of ammunition on her lap.Then she decided she wanted to sledge down the hill. With some help from her brother she got to the top of the hill and peered down the slope. Her classmates had gathered round her wonderingshersquod really do it. She edged forward and then reached the point of no . The wheelchair slid down the slope, faster and faster. Marcela raised her hands like wings crying out ldquowheeee look at me.Then the chair slowed as it approached the bottom on the hill and wobbled to and fro. A bank of snow toppled the chair throwing Marcela out and she fell face first into the snow, arms outstretched.Her brother ran to her and helped her back into the chair. Marcelarsquos face was red with the cold and her eyes tearful. They were tears of joy and laughter.ldquoLook, she said pointing to her shape in the snow ldquoIrsquove made a snow angel!All that Christmas day, Marcela played in the snow with her brother and classmates, even making new friends. She became expert at flying down the hill in her chair.That night Pavel tried to take his bottle of ketchup to bed with him. But he was persuaded the fridge would be a better idea.And as Marcela was falling asleep, the little robin reappeared in the moonlight on her window sill. She smiled at the bird.ldquoIt was the best Christmas ever, she said.ldquoI got my freedom and today I learnt to fly."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-resident-starts-christmas-kindness-campaign-help-others","story":"Demi-Lee Taylor, , of Bayswell Road, started a kindness campaign called The Peoplersquos Christmas Miracle, which aims to support families, the elderly and the homeless in East Lothian at Christmas.She asked people to donate clothes, baby items, toys and food to help those in need.The mum-of-two was moved to act in light of her own experiences and from hearing of the problems faced by others.Demi, who is a le coach and an author who writes books for the terminally ill, said: ldquoI have been approached by parents in the school playground who say their children are having to go into school without breakfast some are being bullied because they canrsquot afford to go on school trips.ldquoI hear the elderly limit their food and heating and the homeless are left out in the cold.ldquoI donrsquot believe anyone should suffer, especially at Christmas time.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the

had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

Edinburghrsquos Hogmanayrsquos city-wide series of site-specic installations combines newly commissioned texts by five writers with new visual projections and sound scores. The event is run in partnership by Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay producers, Underbelly in association with Edinburgh UNESCO City of Literature Trust, with City of Edinburgh Council and Edinburgh International Book Festival.It follows on from last yearrsquos Love Letters to Europe-themed compendium of works, and opened yesterday to usher in Scotlandrsquos Year of Coasts and Waters under the banner of Shorelines, with work that focuses on Edinburghrsquos maritime history in radically dferent ways.Sugar for Your Tea, takes place at the City Chambers on High Street, and sees its author reflect on the darker side of Scotlandrsquos sea-faring past. Using video and projections, Bankole focuses on the seemingly respectable Scottish merchants and businessmen whose names remain familiar from streets and statues across the country, but who made their fortunes on the back of the slave trade.Filmed by Rianne White, who has previously made videos for Young Fathers, The Proclaimers and Kate Tempest, Sugar for Your Tea also sees Bankole perform his text onscreen through a backdrop of light and water to reflect on his own identity as a Scot, as well as honouring his Nigerian ancestors. With the words themselves projected onto the City Chambers by high-tech projection mapping company, Double Take Projections, Bankole has also provided a new soundscape for the event.ldquoI didnrsquot know about Scotlandrsquos role in the slave trade, says Bankole. ldquoThings like that are always buried under the crypt, so this piece actually came from being a human making new discoveries. Irsquom not pointing the finger. Irsquom wanting to make people consider how we have appropriate discussions about identity and move forward.As those who have already trawled across the city yesterday will know, as well as Bankolersquos work, the Shorelines edition of Message from the Skies will feature new writing by Kathleen Jamie, Robin Robertson, Charlotte Runcie and Irvine Welsh. These map the city from the Union Canal in Fountainbridge to the Malmaison hotel on the Shore in Leith, taking in the Northern Lighthouse Board on George Street and the Nelson Monument on Calton Hill en route.Jamiersquos piece, Seascape with WEC, is a poem that captures her experience of witnessing new wave energy converters being tested on the Orkney islands. Graphic designer and animator Thomas Moulson brings the poem to le using vibrant colours inspired by ideas of symmetry and kinetic energy. These are subsequently animated by Susanna Murphy and Cristina Spiteri, the duo behind Bright Side Studios, who worked on last yearrsquos Message from the Skies alongside composer Pippa Murphy on Kapka Kassabovarsquos love letter to Europe projected onto the National Monument of Scotland on Calton Hill. This time out, Bright Side create a playful reflection of Moulsonrsquos visual interpretation of Jamiersquos words on the water above the Union Canal in Fountainbridge.Bright Side also take part in Ten Thousand Miles of Edge, Robin Robertsonrsquos personal reflection of the signicance of Scotlandrsquos seaside landscape in Scotlandrsquos identity as a seafaring nation, and takes the audience on a vast nationwide journey across the countryrsquos coastal geography. With Robertson narrating, Ten Thousand Miles of Edge is augmented by a new musical score by neo-trad troubadour Alasdair Roberts, who looks to Hebridean psalmody and piobiareachd to create something both sacred and elegiac. This is illuminated by Bright Side to create an immersive fusion of elements beamed onto the Nelson Monument on Calton Hill.As another Message from the Skies veteran, Pippa Murphy, provides a new score to accompany Lightkeepers, Charlotte Runciersquos meditation on lighthouses real and fictional, including those built by pioneering engineer Robert Stevenson, grand-father of fiction author extraordinaire, Robert Louise Stevenson. Utilising the Northern Lighthouse Board on George Street as a backdrop, the piece features animations by Kate Charter to shine fresh light on such iconic myth-making structures. There is input here too from singer Karine Polwart, who narrates and sings as part of the piece.Finally, down by The Shore in Leith, local hero Irvine Welsh presents The Sea, which promises a mash-up of Welshrsquos words, film cut-ups by Norman Harman and industrial beats by DJ Steve Mac to illustrate Welshrsquos memoir of the influence of a sailor he met while growing up in Leith. Projections again come care of Double Take Projections, who take over the faccedilade of the Malmaison hotel, formerly the site of a sailorrsquos mission.With a downloadable app developed by Odd Panda Design accompanying the event, Message from the Skies is an immersive experience in every way.ldquoWater is such a rich theme, says Amanda Rogers, producer of this yearrsquos Message from the Skies event, ldquoand each piece sits in its own world, butyou walk to all five pieces, with the sound and visuals you get a full experience. Itrsquos not just words on a wall.Beyond Sugar for Your Tea, Bankole is back in the studio with Massaquoi and Hastings working on new Young Fathers material.ldquoThatrsquos where Irsquom happiest,rsquo says Bankole, ldquocollaborating with my brothers, experimenting. Having two other iniduals pushing me gives me a dferent perspective, and doesnrsquot feel like yoursquore in an echo chamber. It feels like my happy place.Message from the Skies runs as part of Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay until January  from pm to pm each night.www.edinburghshogmanay"},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Labour has to learn the language of progressive nationalism if it is to survive","story":"But people rarely vote on their own narrow material interest, rather on what they think is best for the country as a whole. They clearly didnrsquot think Jeremy Corbyn believed in Britain or had the nationrsquos best interests at heart.Now, one of Mr Corbynrsquos disciples, Rebecca Long-Bailey, has recognised this. In her leadership pitch in theshe has called for Labour to adopt ldquoprogressive patriotism to bring the country together. She is suggesting that Labourrsquos electoral problem was not just opposition to Brexit but its ambivalence regarding the nation.Ms Long-Bailey doesnrsquot see why patriotism should be the property of the right. We should celebrate ldquoLancashire mill workers who supported Abraham Lincolnrsquos anti-slavery blockade of cotton from the American South. But even this tentative and politically-correct version of patriotism proved too much for s of Labour purity on Twitter. She was taken to task for spreading ldquoloathsome nonsense...Tory Lite...dog whistle nationalism. ldquoProgressive patriotism is an oxymoron, said one critic, ldquolike humane fascism. For many supporters of Jeremy Corbyn love of country is irremediably toxic.During the long Brexit culture war, this attitude finally alienated Labourrsquos older, socially conservative voters in the Midlands and North of England. The question is whether Labour has the will or the capacity to win them back. It would have to go a lot further than history lessons about anti-slavery.Can you imagine Momentum activists saying how much they love Britain and its history  Can you hear David Lammy say that, actually, Britain is not a racist country  Mr Corbyn saying that the British Empire wasnrsquot all bad Imagine Ms Long-Bailey saying that our armed forces are the best of British. Or that most men are kind and loving fathers and not part of an oppressive patriarchy. Twitter would go into meltdownLabour started talking about controlling immigration.I just canrsquot see Labour becoming patriotic in a way northern English voters would recognise. Stormzy would be furious.would say it had gone populist, fascist, even.But the inconvenient truth is that many voters just seem hard-wired to regard their community and their country with pride. It is a lot to do with accentuating the positive. The relentless miserablism of the Left leaves people with nothing to feel good about. Itrsquos like watching a permanent Ken Loach film.Scottish nationalists used to make the same mistake of revelling in miserablism. They banged on about how Scotland was impoverished and demeaned by England and how theyrsquod stolen our oil. Then in the noughties it discovered positive nationalism and started talking up Scotland as a progressive country that could be a model for the world. Inclusive, democratic, equalitarian.It worked. The SNPrsquos electoral dominance today is directly related to its celebration of Scotland. The  referendum campaign, with its Yestivals and Saltires, was all about feeling good about being Scottish.Could Labour learn from this  Or has Labour sold its soul to a version of liberal identity politics which loathes the very idea of nations  Labour intellectuals like Emily Thornberry laugh at flag-waving English patriots. Labour academics regard Britain as a neocolonial power, with blood on its hands, oppressing people abroad and racist at home.This is why this General Election could be terminal for Labour. Unlike in Scotland, the English Left seems incapable of finding any positive dimension to nationalism. Britishness is seen as inherently right wing and racist ndash even though Britain gave the world parliamentary democracy, abolished the slave trade and led the defeat of fascism.The Tory PM is dismantling the overtly racist, imperial nationalism of Churchill and Thatcher, in favour of the self-mocking, popular nationalism of the  Olympic Opening Ceremony. Danny Boylersquos pageant of English identity was of course authorised by Mr Johnson as London Mayor. It featured NHS nurses, Chartists and icons of popular culture. Thatrsquos the kind of One Nation Conservatism that Boris Johnson is grasping for, and is temperamentally capable of delivering.It is about reflecting the nation in a favourable light, but it is also a way of doing politics. The Prime Minister is successful because he is relentlessly positive. He makes people feel good about themselves. Labourrsquos characterisation of him as a hard-bitten racist demagogue doesnrsquot ring true. Mr Johnson is actually more in the hail-fellow-well-met mould of one Alex Salmond, who made the SNP what it is today.Mr Salmond too was a gted populist leader, a romantic nationalist who loved Scottish history and understood the importance of supporting the Scottish regiments, even the Queen. The media regarded him with suspicion, but many Scottish voters loved him. He wedded nationalism to social democratic themes of inclusion and equality. In his  Hugo Young lecture on progressive nationalism he hailed left-wing policies, like tuition fees, as the ldquosocial wage.Unlike Mr Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon does not like nationalism, and is quite obviously embarrassed by it. Shersquos even said she would like to remove the word ldquonational from the party name. Butshe did she would risk throwing the cultural baby out with the liberal bathwater. The SNP was an early the beneficiary of the wave of populist nationalism that has now swept England.SNP intellectuals loathe the idea that Scottish nationalism might have anything in common with Brexit and English nationalism. But the similarities are too obvious to ignore. They were both populist rebellions against globalisation and neoliberalism by people who love their country and seek sanctuary within it.How these two nationalisms, Scottish and English, learn to coexist ndash or donrsquot ndash will decide the future of the United Kingdom. Labour may have to learn the language of progressive nationalism to have any future at all.Read more: Why Im giving up Twitter in "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10102291.jpg?type=article-full","title":"cost-living-takes-toll-scots-need-debts-benefits-help","story":"Figures released today also show the Citizens Advicenetwork north of the Border has, since the   financial year, ldquounlocked hundreds of millions of pounds for iniduals in dficulty, delivering the equivalent of pound. billion for those who turned to its staff for help.The figure includes social security entitlements, debt that has been written off, pay and entitlements owed by employers, tax savings and rebates, compensation on consumer issues and food bank referrals.CAS has managed to obtain pound,, for clients in the last two financial years alone.The charity also revealed it had doubled the advice issued on Universal Credit cases in   to almost ,.It said that, behind benefits, debt was the second biggest issue it had to deal with, ldquosuggesting many CAB clients are finding the cost of living unsustainable.Among the , debt queries, council tax remained the number one issue for  .Of those who have problem debts in Scotland, it is estimated only about one in five will seek help from a free advice provider.CAS said it was calling on policy makers, including the UK and Scottish governments, as well as industry, regulators and councils, to make a New Yearrsquos resolution to put the cost of living at the heart of their policies next year.Chief executive Derek Mitchell said: ldquoThe Citizens Advice network in Scotland helps hundreds of thousands of people each year, and in the past decade has unlocked staggering amounts of money for the people who have turned to us for help.ldquoLast year alone our network put poundm back into peoplersquos pockets ndash and the figure for the last decade has been almost pound.bn.ldquoThat is money that has been put back into household budgets, communities and local high streets, and it shows how complex the economy can be for people to navigate, whether itrsquos the welfare state, rights at work or as a consumer.ldquoAs a new year dawns we want to see policymakers ndash whether they are in Parliament, government, council chambers or industry ndash to really put living standards at the heart of their policy agenda.During -, more than , people received advice and assistance from the charity -ndash the equivalent of one in every  adults living in the country.

Thatrsquos up from one in ten in the year to July.:One in five cash machines in Scotland to charge in a yearThe Herald revealed stark warnings in May from the ATM Industry Association that nearly one in five of Scotlandrsquos free to use cash machines were expected to introduce charges to customers in the following  months.It comes after banks have cut the fees paid to ATM operators when a customer uses a free cashpoint, causing many to switch to paid-for models.The shock figures emerged less than a fortnight after Adrian Roberts, LINKrsquos chief commercial officer told MSPs: ldquoIt is absolutely not acceptable for people to have to pay to access their own cash.The falling number of cashpoints is seen as a concern for elderly or vulnerable bank customers who do not use online banking, and for small businesses who rely on access to cash.Scotland has already seen over  bank branches close since , making it one of the worst affected areas in the UK, and often the cashpoints will also go. Banks who have made the cuts consistently say that it is the result of customers preferring to use online, mobile or telephone banking while usage of branches has fallen.Which  said the new figures showed how the UK government should step in to protect peoplersquos access to cash.:South Lanarkshire town that was left with no banksJenny Ross, Which  Money Editor, said: ldquoCountless Scottish communities are being stripped of free access to cash at an alarming rate that could hit the most vulnerable in our society the hardest, while denying many people free withdrawals.ldquoMismangement by the industry and regulators has led to a massive spike in fee-charging machines, while rampant bank branch and cashpoint closures are stripping people of vital cash access and have left the cash landscape on the brink of collapse.ldquoThe UKrsquos new government should seize the opportunity to act now and introduce legislation that protects this important payment method for as long as it is needed.Last month, the Herald revealed that ministers had refused to intervene in the access-to-cash crisis.A UK government response said: ldquoGovernment cannot reverse the changes in the market and in customer behaviour, nor can it determine firmsrsquo commercial strategies in response to those changes. However, the Government will continue to work with the sector to maintain access to vital banking services and ensure that banks support communities across the UK when their local branches close.ldquoThe Government is committed to safeguarding access to cash and proud that Scotland and the rest of the UK has an extensive free-to-use ATM network.\"However, it is important to note that as consumers use digital products more to make and receive payments, the demand for cash and ATMs will continue to fall. While industry must have the flexibility to take such trends into account when making decisions on how best to provide their services, the Government expects commitment from industry to protect access to banking and cash for those who need it.New details about the decline of ATMs comes after the north-west Highlands village of Durness, where locals have to drive for an hour to get to their nearest free ATM, became the first to receive a cash machine as part of a LINK pledge - and it was due to come online last week.LINK has received  separate requests for free access to cash across Scotland, raising fears they wonrsquot be able to cope with demand.:Scottish people pay price as one in seven cant use bank cards due to IT failuresIn August the ATM overseers said that should a high street be threatened with the loss of an ATM or Post Office, it would step in to ensure that a cash machine is made available and paid for with funding from all the UKrsquos main banks and building societies.And in October, it invited consumers and community groups to put in requests for an ATM through the Community Access to Cash Delivery Fund.Supported by the banks and building societies, LINK said it was part of a ldquopilot to support communities across the UK with cash access issues.The new figures from LINK show that despite calls for better access to cash, in November there were  free and chargeable cash machines in Scotland -  fewer than over a year.There were last month  free to use ATMs,  fewer than the same time last year.LINK have said they are expecting to approve between  and  new free ATMs over the next few months while admitting ldquomore still needs to be done to protect cash access.

It also found that cash is only used for three in every ten transactions, down from six in ten a decade ago and is forecast a fall to as low as one in ten transactions within the next  years.It concluded that this sht away from cash towards digital payments is placing signicant strain on the UKrsquos cash infrastructure which currently costs around pound billion a year to run.The government says industry statistics state that cash is being used in a decreasing proportion of UK transactions, falling from % of payments in  to % in .Correspondingly, the number of ATM transactions is declining, with volumes expected to be around % lower in  than .A Bank of Scotland spokeswoman said of the latest online issues: \"Were aware that some of our customers are experiencing problems logging on to Online Banking.

But there are bigger questions here, deserving of more attention, both around what sort of member state an independent Scotland might be, and of what the Scottish Government can do now to reinforce European relations despite Brexit.Many in Scotland have looked at the EUrsquos support for Ireland through the tortuous Brexit process and seen a small country with a seat at the table, that has had the strong backing of the other  EU member states, and that played an exemplary diplomatic game throughout. But being a small country in the EU isnrsquot always easy. It takes political nous, strategy, compromise and collaboration. The EUrsquos smaller states adapt to its terrain in dferent ways, with ying political outlooks, and dfering degrees of success.So how does the current world of smaller EU states look as we enter a new decade  The EU is primarily made up of smaller states, a fact that often gets overlooked as the shting political dynamics of the Franco-German couple sit centre stage. And certainly, the larger member states have always had more power. But the EU has always run too on a mixture of one-off and longer term coalitions between dferent countries. Even at the start, in , the smaller threesome of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg cooperated as the Benelux group to hold their own in the face of the larger trio of France, Germany and Italy.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Politics: The state of the parties going into \",\"description\": \"Politics: The state of the parties going into \",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media PsvcXF poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests PsvcXF.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": : SNPMP admits chance of Indyref this year is probably lsquonilrsquoToday, one of the newest groupings of smaller states is the so-called new Hanseatic League covering the Netherlands, Ireland and the Nordic and Baltic states. The League was set up in , driven partly by the looming impact of Brexit: to many the UK was an important EU partner who needed replacing with new networks. But the Hanseatic League also aims to oppose Francersquos efforts to loosen orthodox economic and monetary policies around the euro.So while an independent Scotland might indeed be well advised to look first to its geographical neighbours for alliances, a neoliberal Hanseatic grouping would not be the most obvious place to start. But within that group there are countries Scotland could learn from. Ireland has worked hard at putting itself in the core of the EU ndash joining the euro, even while staying out of Schengen to protect the Ireland-UK common travel area. Finland too similarly made sure it is not on the sidelines.But an independent Scotland in the EU is not expected to join the euro in a hurry so it would be less of a core player. And the motley group of eight member states not in the euro including, apart from Denmark and Sweden, six central and eastern European member states, is not strong. The UK, with its euro opt-out, gave a certain clout to this group, disappearing now given Brexit.Perhaps an independent Scotland could be like Sweden ndash putting off indefinitely joining the euro, progressive on human rights, gender, climate change and migration  Or it could look further afield for role models ndash Portugal is currently showing how anti-austerity policies can work, just about, while being within the eurozone.:Sturgeon reassures EU citizens in New Year messageWhatever the strategy and policy stance, being a well-regarded EU member state depends on playing a constructive, cooperative game, with excellent diplomatic and networking skills, building bilateral and multilateral alliances, showing commitment to the EU as a whole not just to onersquos own narrow interests. Certainly, an independent Scotland in the EU ndash and in accession negotiations ndash would have, not least, to show it was not going to be a mini-UK, being one of the awkward squad and demandingmultiple opt-outs.All this is some way off, should Scotland eventually choose independence. But her international and European relationships need more not less work now to limit the damage that Brexit will do.The Scottish Government has already taken ious initiatives in its European work. It has a Nordic-Baltic strategy. And it has established government offices and ldquoinnovation and investment hubsin Brussels, Dublin, London, Paris and Berlin. A new review into strengthening Ireland-Scotland relationships should report this March.:Foreign property investors poised to swoop on ScotlandBut there is much more that could be done. The European Union is at the start of a new five-year term ndash with new Commission and Council presidents and big challenges ahead in a turbulent world. Scotland should have a clear European strategy setting out its interests and goals for the EU, and how it would hope to contribute and participate even from the outside, ranging from the environment and climate change to human rights, education, research, culture, competitiveness and the much-discussed green new deal. Ireland, Sweden, the Netherlands ndash even big regions like Baia ndash have clearly set out European strategies.True, foreign policy is not a devolved power but around the world cities, regions and sub-states are increasingly cooperating internationally on many key issues. Yet the Scottish Government seems a little nervous of being seen to have too clear or deliberate a para-diplomacy strategy. Such nerves should be set aside.A Scottish European strategy could be the centre of a wider international strategy and would strengthen Scotlandrsquos bilateral relationships across the EU. That would be helpful to Scotland today and, potentially, to the Scottish Governmentrsquos EU accession aspirations.Paradiplomacy on climate change is one example. There will quite likely be a row in  over the next big climate summit, COP, taking place in Glasgow in the autumn ndash the UK Government will aim to be centre stage and side-line the Scottish Government. But a Scottish Government that is working strategically with other EU member states, showing adept paradiplomacy, in the run up to COP may hold its own perfectly well.Amidst the Brexit furore, Scotland has established a quite distinct, pro-European image across the EU. The challenge now is to build on that to promote Scotlandrsquos wide, dense range of Scottish-EU networks and interests. Andthat is done well, Scotland will already be showing ndash to itself and to the EU ndash the sort of member state an independent Scotland might one day be.Kirsty Hughes is Director of the Scottish Centre on European Relations"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-tv-tantrums","story":"GARY: Tank Commander star Greg McHugh has received plaudits for his comedy turn in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs at the SSE Hydro.

explained that the crater was most likely to have been created by a meteor about  metres in diameter and weighing , tonnes hitting the Earth.:The mystery of the meteorite that struck the Isle of LewisFor the study published in the journal Meteoritics  Planetary Science, the researchers collected samples from around the crater and used exposure dating which estimates theof time a rock has been

which measures how long ago sediment was last exposed to sunlight.Dr Barrows, a professor of environmental change, said: ldquoThe crater is located in a fortuitous situation where we can use two dferent techniques to determine its age.Wolfe Creek Crater is one of seven sets of impact craters in Australia dating to within the last , years. From this, the researchers were able to calculate how often these crater-producing events occur.Dr Barrows explained that the dating exercise suggested that meteors could be striking the planet more frequently than previously calculated.He said: ldquoAlthough the rate is only one large meteor hitting Australia every , years, it isnrsquot that simple. The craters are only found in the arid parts of Australia.ldquoElsewhere, the craters are destroyed by geomorphic activity like river migration or slope processes in the mountains.:Everything you need to know about the Perseid meteor showerldquoSince Australia has an excellent preservation record with dated craters within the arid zone, we can estimate a rate for the whole Earth.ldquoTaking into account that arid Australia is only about % of the surface, the rate increases to one hitting the Earth every  years or so.ldquoThere have been two big objects hitting the atmosphere in the last century ndash Tunguska in  and Chelyabinsk in .ldquoThe number of large objects in the atmosphere is probably  times this number because stony meteorites are far more common but not as many survive the fiery journey through the atmosphere or effectively make craters.ldquoOur results give us a better idea of how frequent these events are."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10858692.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scots-universities-top-uk-student-dropout-rate-rise-rankings","story":"Some two out of three UK universities and colleges have seen an increase in non-completion rates for students over five years.Analysis covering a five-year period from   to   shows that in some cases, dropout rates have risen by more than five percentage points.Two of the seven institutions which had an increase of more than five percentage points in the five-year period were in Scotland.The University of Abertay, Dundee, topped the list, with an . percentage point rise over this five-year period, from .% in   to .% in  .:Do not blame Brexit for Scots lack of prospectsAnd the University of Highlands and Islands, which has nearly , full or part-time students came a close second with a . percentage point rise.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”The government’s failure to fund the ageing inter-island ferry fleet has left Orkney’s most remote and vulnerable communities with an inferior service compared to other areas in Scotland claimed Councillor Stockan.Following a y battle, the council secured £. million in additional government funding for internal ferry services for   — described by Councillor Stockan at the time as the “most signicant financial breakthrough” made by the council in years.The air of positivity failed to last however.OIC say they need £. million to run services in the current financial year — £. million more than the Scottish Government allocation.“This is a burden that most other Scottish councils do not have to bear,” Councillor Stockan continued. “The greater the burden placed on the council to keep the ferries running, the greater the risk of severe cuts to other vital services our community depends upon.“We need a long-term commitment from the government to fully fund the cost of running the service and replacing vessels with modern, cheaper-to-run ferries of a standard you would expect on routes as important as these.”RET was also in Councillor Stockan’s sights.The tarf, which would see cheaper fares for all when travelling across the Pentland Firth, has been mired in legal proceedings with Pentland Ferries making a complaint to the European Commission.From the outset, those at Holyrood said they were committed to see the scheme introduced within the first six months of . However, there appears to be no resolution in sight as we now head into .“It is outrageous that we in Orkney are still waiting for RET and that there appears to be no urgency or political will from the Government to resolve this.“Again, this is a clear case of discrimination against Orkney and our community will find it abominable that the money the government has saved by failing to introduce RET on our routes has been spent where — when it could have been committed to supporting our internal ferry service.“This is why I have written to the First Minister and appealed for her to intervene and ensure that Orkney is treated as fairly as other coastal communities with leline ferry services.”In response, a Scottish Government spokesperson indicated that the government was committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised.The spokesperson said: “At present, Orkney Islands Council are wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.#However, the Scottish Government understands the signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities and we have made clear our commitment to Orkney internal ferry services with the provision of additional revenue funding support totalling £. million in the last two years.“We continue to discuss long term solutions with both Orkney Islands Council and Shetland Islands Council. We established a working group to examine these issues and we are now in receipt of the final report which we are currently considering.”The spokesperson continued: “It is the responsibility of inidual local authorities to manage their own budgets and to allocate the total financial resources available to them, including on ferry services, on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.“Ultimately, it is for locally elected representatives to make local decisions on how best to deliver services to their local communities.“Ministers remain committed to pursuing all avenues to deliver RET for Orkney and Shetland, however, the first step is to resolve the complaint that Pentland Ferries have made to the European Commission.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Following the throw from former Doonie player Barrie Reid at pm, the game travelled as close to the Shorie goal as the back of the Kirkwall iCentre before a break involving Mr Baillie#s son Findley Cooper saw the beginning of a slow journey up Great Western Road toward Lidl supermarket and then onto Junction Road.With both teams seeming to get the upper hand at dferent times, it was hard to tell what the outcome would be. However, on this occasion, the Uppies weren#t to be resisted and they eventually claimed a very hard-fought win.With the Doonies fighting to the last minute, a mighty throw saw the ba#, made by Edgar Gibson, hit Mackinson#s Corner, and within just a few minutes Mr Baillie emerged from the pack as the winner, to cheers and singing from his teammates.Asked to described how he felt about the win, he replied: #I#m absolutely over the moon. You have no idea how much this means to me. I don#t know what time the game finished, it must have been six or seven hours, but what a team game.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Directed by Jezza Neumann, it allowed a handful of children to give first-hand accounts of le on the financial margins.The fact those featured were so young stripped their commentary of artice. They talked in matter-of-fact tones of hardships that would have broken many adults. Courtney, eight, who lives in Cambridge – “the most unequal city in the UK” – counted out coppers in the hope there would be enough for heating, before resigning herself to another night spent sleeping in her coat. Cameron, a pale and undernourished boy, described eking out diminishing food supplies. “We try not to eat a lot in one day, even though most of us are really hungry,” he said.Growing Up Poor painted a picture of the UK that made A Christmas Carol, with all its paternalism, feel entirely contemporary a world where the working poor are forced to survive on charity hand-outs.It was jam-packed with heroes. There was Danielle, who tried to carve out a bit of space in temporary accommodation to study for her GCSEs, and Courtney’s mother, who drew a chart to try to explain her depression to her daughter. Then there were those who donated to and ran the food banks, and Neumann himself, who avoided all the pitfalls of poverty porn to bring us this thoughtful piece of film-making. The villains – the architects of the Westminster government’s austerity programme – were less visible, but ever-present, behind the scenes, undermining the foundations that used to keep the lives of the underprivileged stable. Iain Duncan Smith’s welfare reforms were the dark heart of Growing Up Poor. Whatever his original intention, those reforms and the striver skiver rhetoric they produced were responsible for pushing just-coping families into destitution .And yet Duncan Smith is among those being rewarded in the New Year’s Honours list. Much to the horror of anti-poverty campaigners, the man behind Universal Credit, the bedroom tax and the two-child cap – three of the most odious policies of the decade – is being knighted because ofthe havoc he wreaked. That’s the way it goes nowadays. Those who sow chaos and confusion are gloried, while those left to pick up the pieces of their own and other people’s lives remain in the shadows. The likes of Duncan Smith lack the insight to be embarrassed by such unseemly boys’ club back-slapping. He will doubtless regard himself as a fitting recipient of the title Sir – asUniversal Credit had fulfilled its mission of helping millions back into work rather than entrenching misery and social exclusion.It was, famously, in Easterhouse, that Duncan Smith experienced an epiphany. Back in , he wept in the face of condemned tenements and boarded up lives. This moment of empathy inspired him to evangelise about “compassionate Conservatism”. Under his leadership, he pledged, the Tories would become “the natural party of those who want to make a better le for themselves and their children”.How hollow that sounds now. Yet, with hindsight, that phrase foreshadowed everything that would go wrong with his welfare reforms. It hinted at that most Dickensian of binaries: the deserving and the undeserving poor. It made a spurious distinction between “those who want to make a better le for themselves” and those considered too feckless to care.There are groups, including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, who believe Universal Credit was a good idea in principle. It was aimed at simplying an over-complicated system by rolling six benefits into one, and – more importantly – at incentivising people to work.The logic was, on the face of it, unimpeachable. The way the benefits system was structured meant those who moved from claiming, say, Jobs Seekers Allowance, to low-paid employment would often find themselves losing out financially, which cannot be right.But with this logic came other shakier assumptions: that everyone ought to be entering the labour market that no-one would ever be too ill to work or have other competing pressures on their time, such as caring for children, the elderly or the disabled.And so a new era was indeed ushered in: an era of sanctions and Atos fitness-for-work tests, which saw benefit claimants penalised for attending funerals and the chronically ill forced to prove they had not staged some miraculous recovery. It was the era of being punished for having an extra bedroom – evenyour own child slept in it every other weekend. It was the era of growing mental health dficulties and soaring suicides. The era of I, Daniel Blake.Universal Credit caused more problems than it solved,it solved any. It was supposed to help people into work. But in , the Institute for Fiscal Studies claimed some groups, such as single parents, had less of an incentive to work under Universal Credit than the old system and that . million working families faced an average loss of £, a year.The five-week hiatus before Universal Credit was received meant claimants like Courtney’s mother had no money to feed their children. They were forced to go to food banks or to take out loans they had no hope of repaying.By the time the National Audit Office issued its scathing report in , Duncan Smith was gone. He resigned over cuts to disability benefits in , and four more work and pensions secretaries followed in quick succession. But the conceptual and logistical flaws the NAO report identied were ones that originated under his watch. Head of the organisation, Amyas Morse, said the case for Universal Credit was based on unproven assumptions. “We think the larger claims for universal credit, such as boosted employment, are unlikely to be demonstrable at any point in future,” he said.Nor has the situation improved over the last  months. Last month, the UN rapporteur for extreme poverty, Philip Alston, said the UK government’s austerity policies were driven by “a political desire for social engineering” and that key elements of the post war social contract devised by William Beveridge had been swept away.Alston also insisted the UK government was in a state of denial about reports suggesting  million people, a fth of the population, now live in poverty, with . million destitute.It is in the same spirit of denial, no doubt, that Duncan Smith was offered and accepted his knighthood. His elevation further undermines an already discredited honours system. \u2028But it is entirely in tune with today’s politics: cruelty and incompetence rewarded by a self-promoting clique, while those working long hours to improve people’s lives might as well be invisible.As the MP for Chingford and Woodford Green kneels on the red carpet at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, what will Courtney be doing  Or Cameron  Or Danielle  They will be struggling on, supporting their parents through the worst of their misery. Unfortunately, there are no knighthoods for stoicism. Or resilience. Or making the best of things.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

His comments came in Twitter remarks after media outlets contacted him for his views on party chairman Ian Laverys analysis of why Labour lost so heavily.: It will take a leader of extraordinary charisma to deliver a Labour victoryMr Lavery has said Labour lost the general election because of its \"Brexit position, infighting, a collapse of industry in our communities and a lack of trust in our ability to deliver.\"But Norwich South MP Mr Lewis tweeted: \"Whilst I dont agree with everything hes said I do agree with parts of his analysis.\"So perhapsall we use the comingelections as a lens through which to listen to each other, we can work out a path ahead.

That shouldn’t mean a negative focus on EU citizens living here, but as British and European leaders arm-wrestle their way through the year ahead, producing us versus them narratives and “Hop off you frogs” headlines aplenty, it probably will. In  a new Labour leader will probably officially embrace Brexit and leave millions of Remain voters south of the Border without any means of democratic expression, thanks also to the collapse of the bickering People’s Vote campaign and the leaderless Lib Dems. Anyone hoping the main Westminster opposition parties will swtly recover from the failed Brexit battles of yesteryear to refocus on the human rights battles of tomorrow is likely to be disappointed.The enlarged cohort of SNP MPs has the energy, mandate and moral authority to champion the views of the “losing” side, raise important questions about the way Brexit is managed and persuade gung-ho Leave voters that giving Boris carte blanche over every aspect of British le is not a good idea. But the third largest party at Westminster is customarily ignored by politicians and the mainstream media. There’s no reason to think  will be any dferent.South of the Border at least, Europeanism has suddenly become as unfashionable and last season as glittery cards, wrapping paper, carols and Brussels sprouts – a Christmas tradition which could, incidentally, disappearrivals follow the example set this Christmas by Morrisons and Asda and rebadge their sprouts with local origins. Soon, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Scottish sprouts will be all we’ve ever known.A small thing perhaps and both supermarkets insist that pleasing Brexiters played no part in their re-labelling decisions. But maybe a sign of things to come. A sign that anything or anyone from a European country will soon smack of an alien culture. Is this overstating things  The statistics suggest not.The number of hate crimes recorded by police in England and Wales has more than doubled from , in - to a new record of , in  while the number of cases passed to prosecutors has dropped from  to just  per cent. Admittedly, referral rates have dropped across all types of offence, hate crimes sometimes don’t have named suspects, and out-of-court disposals don’t result in criminal charges. Suspects are also harder to identy when anonymous accounts are used to send abuse and threats online. But still, as weekend stabbings in a rabbi’s home north of New York City amply testy, attacks on minorities can happen in apparently tolerant environments. And Britain is not likely to be all that tolerant a place in . If EU leaders take a tough stance during forthcoming trade talks – as they surely must – the hostile and triumphalist Europhobic British press will have a field day, demonising EU institutions and painting European leaders as robbers and thugs determined to cheat the noble, freedom-seeking Brits. In this unpleasant and toxic political environment, unsuspecting, ordinary EU citizens will be on the receiving end of anti-Brussels sentiment. Indeed, that nasty process has already started, in some very surprising locations.A few customers at the Ceilidh Place Hotel and restaurant in Ullapool objected to a tiny EU flag mounted over the cash-desk. Days later, a French waiter was effectively told to get back home by a guest. Now all waiting staff wear T-shirts sporting the -stars of the EU flag on their backs, in solidarity with their French colleague and anyone  picked on for their ethnicity. Thanks to the hotel owners’ strong public stance, there’s been open discussion about changing public behaviour and some visitors have revealed bruising encounters they’ve experienced where. One Portuguese man living here for almost a decade, said customers now regularly demand to be served by “someone who speaks English properly,” at his workplace – a large High Street department store in Scotland. His English is almost perfect. A workmate also told him to stop using his native tongue while chatting with two other Portuguese speakers in the staff canteen. Are these incidents unusual one-offs or the tip of an iceberg set to grow larger as Britain’s acrimonious withdrawal from the EU dominates front pages and political discourse in   How will employers and managers respond Scotland prides itself on welcoming New Scots and Nicola Sturgeon was widely praised for reaching out to EU citizens straight after the  referendum, reassuring all who’d chosen to live and work here that Scotland was their home. This message of international solidarity gets loud cheers at independence rallies – partly because it neatly distinguishes Scots from very dferent English attitudes towards immigration, Europe and international cooperation. But are we just virtue-signalling and kidding ourselves  Are EU citizens getting almost as many pointed and unpleasant jibes in Remain-voting Scotland as Brexit-voting England  It’s impossible to know for sure. But these and other incidents should prompt the SNP to try and reconfigure the Westminster debate before Britain withdraws on  January. Otherwise, a very nasty scenario could develop – one in which EU nationals are singled out, pilloried and turned into scapegoats for the political and economic uncertainty that will inevitably arise as a wildly over-promising Conservative leader hits the brick wall of an unyielding and united bloc of EU trade negotiators. Agreed – the notion that Britain might somehow remain in the EU or single market, through the mechanism of a second vote, or a Remain alliance at Westminster is now officially dead, but the idea of a part-European identity and the internationalising impact of freedom of movement has always meant more to Scots Remain voters than the arcane details of tarf-free trade, and harmonised regulations. It still does. Protecting the rights of EU citizens living amongst us is an expression of enlightened self-interest, curiosity about other cultures, gratitude for the energy and enthusiasm of incomers and recognition of the enduring importance of respecting cultural and ethnic dference. Boris Johnson’s self-imposed December trade negotiations deadline is bound to ramp up anti-European, anti-foreigner rhetoric.If Scotland wants to remain a proud “mongrel nation”, we must hold the line against any descent into foreigner-blaming.

We can’t wait to spend Christmas with Kezzie she will definitely get lots of toys and treats for dinner too.”Sarah Park, assistant manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, is delighted Kezzie has found a home in time for the festive season, but urges people to remember that dogs are a substantial commitment and responsibility the old slogan ‘A dog is for le, not just for Christmas’, coined  years ago as part of a nationwide campaign to avoid people treating pets as disposable toys, should still very much be heeded.She said: “We are so glad Kezzie has settled into her new home. “Although we were sad to see her go, we are over the moon because she couldn’t have found a better family. “Although Kezzie is the perfect example of a dog finding their forever home, statistics show online searches for puppies sky-rocket by  per cent in the countdown to Christmas and we would urge the public not to buy puppies or dogs as gts. “Think carefully about the le-long commitment of getting a pet before making the decision. “If someone isn’t sure about whether now is the right time is to welcome a four-legged friend into their home, we would encourage them to support rescue dogs in other ways such as becoming a volunteer foster carer or sponsoring one of our beautul dogs.”Dogs Trust Ballymena currently has  dogs of ying breeds available for adoption.Heartbroken son’s emotional tribute to his road victim father...his ‘rock’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"TYRO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"TYRO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"new ulster hockey kirk cup sponsorship deal to help raise funds for ni children s hospice","story":"Ahead of the final, NI Law Firm of the Year, Millar McCall Wylie, has announced a sponsorship deal with Ulster Hockey to back the competition through to the end of .Chief Operating Officer, Christopher McCandless said: ldquoWe are thrilled to be sponsoring the Kirk Cup, both this season and next.

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can.

I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane.

We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers.

This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"agreement to resurrect stormont must be sustainable dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

None of them, I don’t think, need to be exhausted ad infinitum, we need to be bring this to a conclusion. There are pressures continuing to mount in relation to public health, health services and the treatment of staff in the health service. We need to get back working again so we can fix those as quickly as possible,” he said.Talks to restore a devolved government in Northern Ireland have resumed today at Stormont House. pic sSOEZxpgp— Northern Ireland OfficeJanuary , Mr Donaldson said his party want to see agreement reached “as quickly as possible” but also want to ensure that any agreement is “fair, balanced and sustainable”.“We are not in the business of snatching at something because there is a deadline, we want Stormont restored and we want it restored as soon as possible,” he said.“We want to see a settlement, a fair pay

Morganand John Ross of Unite Unionists at Stormont Mr Donaldson said his party favoured reforming the petition of concern, adding that all parties “agree it should be retained as an important safeguard”.From Thursday morning a number of protesters stating their opposition to an Irish Language Act being included in any potential deal set up camp outside the talks venue holding aloft union flags.Three years on from the collapse of the devolved government, the Stormont parties have until a January  deadline to strike a deal to revive the institutions.On that date, legislation to give civil servants additional powers to run Northern Ireland’s struggling public services expires and Mr Smith will assume a legal obligation to call a snap Assembly election.The latest push to restore powersharing broke up the week before Christmas, with UK and Irish governments singling out the DUP as the party standing in the way of a deal.The party rejected the claims, insisting it would not be “bounced” into a “quick fix” that falls apart when tested.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Roundtable talks at Stormont House before Christmas failed to secure a breakthrough Devolution can only be restored once the DUP and Sinn Fein  – the region’s two largest parties – agree terms to re-enter a mandatory coalition executive in Belfast.The other three main parties – the SDLP, Ulster Unionists and Alliance – are also involved in the talks process convened by the UK and Irish Governments.While they could take positions in any new executive, their sign-off on a deal is not essential and a government could be formed in their absence, with those parties having the option of going into opposition.Expectations of a breakthrough rose after the DUP and Sinn Fein both suffered bruising results in the general election.With many interpreting the outcome as a public judgment on the parties’ failure to do a deal, stalled efforts to restore the institutions appeared to gain fresh momentum in December.However, proposals to reform a contentious cross-community voting mechanism in the Assembly have emerged as a key sticking point in efforts to finalise an agreement, with the DUP unhappy about what is being countenanced.The DUP is also seeking changes to ensure the devolved institutions are more stable in future and cannot be readily pulled down.Proposed legislative protections for Irish language speakers are another crucial element of the negotiations.The Stormont parties are also seeking firm commitments from the UK Government on a financial package to accompany theof devolution – money that would likely be targeted at the region’s crisis-hit health service. speaking with Julian Smith during a meeting last year \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Simon Coveneyspeaking with Julian Smith during a meeting last year Mr Smith and Mr Coveney were in Belfast on New Year’s Day for discussions ahead of the resumption of formal exchanges with the political parties.Mr Coveney urged the parties to show leadership and generosity.He said the new year offered a chance for a new beginning and urged all sides not to disappoint the public again.Stormont imploded three years ago this month when the late Sinn Fein deputy first minister Martin McGuinness resigned in protest at the DUP’s handling of a botched green energy scheme.That dispute soon widened to encompass traditional rts over issues such the Irish language and the toxic legacy of the Troubles.A logjam over proposals to reform the petition of concern voting mechanism was one of the main reasons a deal failed to materialise before Christmas.It was designed to protect minority rights but politicians have accused each other of misusing it for their own ends.Discussions around change are focused on making it more dficult for one party to use the petition to block controversial legislation.The parties are also considering amending Assembly rules to make it harder to collapse the institutions."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast graveyard book remembers ordinary people who did extraordinary things","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

Theyre a tradition which need to be maintained.\"On a wider point, I have never seen anything wrong with hunting for control, but people who complain about these hunts are missing the point.\"Its not about killing foxes, its about people with a love of horses and tradition coming together in a colourful occasion, occasions that have been held for years.\"The League Against Cruel Sports, though, maintains more than halfof respondents to polling carried out believe hunting with dogs is already banned in Northern Ireland as it is in England, Wales and Scotland.Janice Watt, senior public affairs officer for the campaign group in Northern Ireland, said hunting and killing animals for sport might satisfy a small minority, but most people find it repulsive.She added: \"With polling showing widespread opposition to this so-called sport, its clear that hunting should be made illegal in Northern Ireland, and the league is working hard to ensure that as soon as Stormont sits again we get a ban to bring our nation into line with the rest of the UK.\"In a poll of , people living here released by the group, % of respondents believe it should be made illegal to hunt deer with live dogs, compared to % who believe it should remain legal.When it comes to fox hunting, % of respondents believe that it should be made illegal to hunt the animals, compared to % who think it should remain legal.The polling, commissioned by the group, asked people aged  and over living in Northern Ireland their views on a iety of animal welfare topics, including hunting.Of those polled, % believe it is illegal to use dogs to hunt live animals in Northern Ireland, compared with % who think it is legal and % who did not know."},{"url":null,"title":"full list of northern ireland new years honours","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was followed by St Kevins College in Enniskillen in st place with .%, and, both in joint nd place, St Catherines College in Armagh and St Michaels College in Enniskillen with .%.Dalriada School headmaster Tom Skelton said he was \"absolutely delighted\" with the results.\"Its a fantastic achievement for the staff and pupils involved,\" he said. \"To take every child over the line with % five A*-C represents a lot of hard work and the support of parents as well.\"Two years ago we were % as well, so were delighted to get up there again. I think it reflects well on the school, the pupils and the standards set by staff.\"Mr Skelton said the league table \"shows the success of the grammar school system\" and he added: \"Pastoral care is a massive part of it. We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort. Its about hard work and dedication,\" he said of its joint ninth place.Principal of Castlederg High School Elaine McKelvey said she was \"delighted\" it was the highest-ranking non-grammar school in the league table.\"These results are testimony to the excellent provision for learning made at Castlederg High School by a highly dedicated staff, working in partnership with very supportive parents to ensure the best possible outcome for each young person,\" she said.Mrs McKelvey paid tribute to the hard work and dedication of staff during \"a most challenging period for educational delivery within all schools in Northern Ireland, given the shortfall in capital funding and inequitable remuneration for teaching staff\".\"Most of all though, we are tremendously proud of our pupils and their achievements, noting the breadth of opportunity for the future that such excellent exam results have created for them,\" she added.The Department of Education said the information contained in the league table relating to GCSE results \"does not provide a valid basis for comparing performance between schools, since it takes no account of intakes of the schools or of any other factors that may affect pupil performance\".It added: \"No single measurement can constitute a fair or accurate evaluation of a school, and the figures should be considered in the context of other information about schools and their pupils.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/4f016/38822178.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/e%20Teenage%20victims.jpg","title":"the headlines of 2019 a year of roller coaster highs","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Former Chief Constable George Hamilton, who had described the officers as \"brave\", later apologised to the families of the teenagers.March: Soldier F is chargedIn March, a former Paratrooper was told he will face murder charges over the killing of two people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in .The Public Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to prosecute Soldier F for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney.William McKinneyThe sole prosecution was seen as a \"terrible disappointment\" by some of the families of the  people killed at a civil rights march on  January, .The day became known as Bloody Sunday - one of the darkest days of the Troubles.Soldier F also faces charges for the attempted murders of Patrick ODonnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn.The Public Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute  other soldiers and two Official IRA men.James Wrays brother Liam said he was \"very saddened for the other families\" of those killed on Bloody Sunday.\"Their hearts must be broken,\" he said.\"It has been a sad day but the Wray family are relieved.\"Linda Nash, whose brother William was shot dead, said she felt \"let down by a law and a justice system thats supposed to protect people\".But the news led to a loyalist campaign of support for Soldier F, with banners erected across Northern Ireland over what some saw as the unfair victimisation of former British soldiers who served here.April: Lyra McKee is shot dead by dissidentsJournalist Lyra McKeewas fatally shot in the head while observing rioting in Londonderrys Creggan estate in April. The New IRA later admitted carrying out the murder.Massive public outcry followed her death, with former prime minister Theresa May, Irish president Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar among those to attend her funeral at St Annes Cathedral in Belfast.Lyra McKeeThere was a standing ovation, and loud applause erupted, at her funeral service when priest Fr Martin Magill openly challenged the politicians in the pews over the ongoing Stormont stalemate. \"Why in Gods name does it take the death of a -year-old woman to get to this point \" he asked.In the days after the murder a protest by friends of Ms McKee took place outside the Londonderry offices of dissident republican political group Saoradh, which has been linked to the New IRA.A number of protesters smeared red handprints on republican slogans outside the office, and they quickly became a symbol for peace across the country.A strong LGBTQ activist, Belfast born Lyra had moved to Derry to be with her partner, Sara Canning, shortly before her death.Her book, Angels with Blue Faces, which deals with the  IRA murder of Belfast MP Robert Bradford, was published several months after her death.June: Boris tackles BrexitAway from the ongoing political turmoil as Stormont remained closed for business, the main topic in the political arena was Brexit.After several failed attempts to get her Brexit deal for the UK to leave the European Union through Parliament, Theresa May announced she would be standing down as Prime Minister on May .Mrs May was finally replaced by Boris Johnston after leaving office on June .After ing to the EU, Mr Johnson came back with a new deal, but several more failed attempts to find a route through parliament finally led to a General Election on December .Boris JohnsonBrexit brought particular concerns for Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK with an EU land border, and debate raged over the frontier. Business leaders said no-deal would have proved disastrous. The farming community was facing devastation with the loss of EU subsidies coupled with new trade tarfs between north and south. Experts warned that farmers would be left facing bankruptcy.A real issue for all was the lack of clarity about what any potential Brexit would mean for Northern Ireland. Everyone had an opinion on what Brexit would mean. When Mr Johnson ed with his new deal from the EU, it became known as the Betrayal Act by loyalists who saw it as a threat to the Union. They claimed it put an economic border in the Irish Sea and meant Northern Ireland would be treated dferently to the rest of the UK.Disagreements about what it all means for Northern Ireland will continue in the next  months.July: Lowry wins at PortrushJuly saw the worlds best golfers and thousands of golf fans flock to the north coast as Royal Portrush hosted The Open for the first time in almost  years.The championship generated more than £ million of economic benefit for Northern Ireland, according to a study commissioned by organisers and proved a real boost to the tourist industry with hotels sold out and fans flocking to the scenic location from across the world - , fans arrived on the north coast with more than half coming from outside Northern Ireland.Shane LowryThe figures helped boost predictions that  will be a record breaking year for tourism in Northern Ireland with .m people expecting to have visited in the year.Irish winner Shane Lowry lted the coveted Claret Jug at the end of the event, six shots clear of nearest challenger, Englands Tommy Fleetwood. There was disappointment as Holywoods Rory McIlroy failed to make the cut for the final two rounds. He revealed recently how he fought to hold back tears during his unsuccessful bid.August: Nora is found dead in MalaysiaNora Quoirin , whose mother Meabh is from Belfast, was reported missing after her father discovered she was not in her bedroom at the Dusun Resort on Sunday, August  during a family holiday to Malaysia.On August , the Quoirin family said: \"We believe she has been abducted.\"We are especially worried because Nora has learning and developmental disabilities. We have no reason to believe she wandered off and is lost.\"Teenager Nora Quoirin went missing on a family holidayIncreasingly desperate after nine days without news, Noras family offered a £, reward, donated by a Belfast businessman, for information, but a day later Noras body was discovered near a waterfall less than two miles from the holiday villa.Malaysian police said they believed she died from internal bleeding probably caused by hunger and stress.Her parents have always maintained a criminal element was involved and have since enlisted the support of the Irish government as they call for Malaysian authorities to carry out an in-depth inquiry.Noras funeral was held at St Brigids Church, Belfast, on September .October: immigrants’ bodies found in lorryIn October, the UK was shocked when  bodies of immigrants were discovered in the back of a lorry.Lorry driver Maurice Mo Robinson from Co Armagh was arrested in the wake of the tragedy.All those who died - eight women and  men - were originally from Vietnam and had been trying to enter the UK illegally in the refrigerated trailer.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The container lorry in which  people were found dead at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, Essex Police said they had received the first reports about bodies found in a lorry in Grays, Essex just before .am on October .Robinsonwas later charged with the manslaughter of the  victims, people trafficking, and immigration and money laundering offences.He pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey on November  to conspiring with others to assist illegal immigration between May ,  and October , .A second man from Northern Ireland was charged with multiple counts of manslaughter. Eamonn Harrisonappeared in court in Dublin to face  charges, including  manslaughter charges, conspiracy to commit human trafficking and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration. A decision is pending on whether or not he will be extradited to the UK.Two brothers were also identied by police as suspects - Ronan and Christopher Hughes, who have links to Armagh and Co Monaghan in the Republic.December: Voters speakThe General Election of December  gave Boris Johnson and his Conservative Party an -seat majority in the House of Commons and heralded the end of Jeremy Corbyns tenure as leader of the opposition Labour Party.There was plenty of interest in the local scene with some big name casualties. The biggest loser was the DUP, with Nigel Dodds ousted by Sinn Feins John Finucane after serving as North Belfast MP for  years. The DUP also lost South Belfast where the SDLPs Claire Hanna unseated Emma Little-Pengelly by over , votes.

Both times they failed to capture a parliamentary majority, meaning they could not win a confidence vote that is required before taking office.

But the ERC’s abstention means the Socialists could get the required simple majority, more votes for them than against them, in a second vote on Tuesday.Mr Sanchez’s success is not guaranteed. Pending political, legal and administrative decisions could still thwart him before the votes are counted, including ongoing talks between parties.Also, the National Electoral Commission is due to rule soon on whether ERC leader Oriol Junqueras, currently in a Spanish prison for his role in Catalan separatist activities, can take his seat in the European Parliament.

There is a proper procedure to dispose of drugs. “There are bins at either end of this road and there is a state-of-the-art civic amenity close by, so there is no excuse to throw rubbish at the side of the road.“We did a lot of work in schools recently in relation to fly-tipping to try and educate young people but those responsible have no regard for anyone,” he said. googletag.cmd.push Tributes pour in for teacher who was ‘loved by all’The communities of Draperstown and Desertmartin were shocked and saddened in January to hear of the passing of beloved teacher Bridget Wilson.Better known as Cassie, she was a central figure on the teaching staff of St Mary’s Primary School in Draperstown.One of Cassie’s colleagues, former principal Matt Trolan told the Derry Post: “Cassie was a fantastic teacher.

The time for acrimony and ision is over. The time for slogans and soundbites is over. “The test now for every party that has talked up getting back to work is to go back to the Executive table and deliver.”SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood MP has said that parties must enter today’s negotiations prepared for the compromises necessary to restore power sharing.He said: “Later this week, after months of talking about partnership and compromise in TV debates and newspaper articles, political leaders have the opportunity to show that it wasn’t just talk. “For almost three years we have been without a government to deal with hospital waiting lists, pay parity for healthcare workers, the funding crisis in our schools and the welfare clf edge about to hit tens of thousands of families. It’s time to get back to work.“The SDLP has made compromise proposals already. With less than two weeks to secure a resolution, all parties must be prepared to stretch themselves in the substantial common interests of all our communities.”Meanwhile, UUP Leader Steve Aiken said his party is committed to building a better government through a “restored and reformed” Assembly and Executive.The British and Irish governments had been holding talks with the parties, however, they were paused over the Christmas holidays.The parties have until January  to negotiate a deal, otherwise Northern Ireland Secretary of State Julian Smith says he must call a fresh assembly election.January  will mark three years since Stormont collapsed, when the late Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness resigned in protest over the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ebenezer Scrooge wasnt the first fictional character to see ghosts at this time of year. In fact the tradition probably goes back further than Christmas itself. As the nights grow long and the year creeps towards its close its a natural instinct that people gather together. Its also natural that this time makes us think of people and places that are no longer here. These thoughts have often morphed into tales based on what we encounter at this time of year - winter, death and the eventual rebirth experienced in spring. googletag.cmd.push In Europe this was usually connected to the pagan rituals surrounding the winter solstice known as Yule. The shortest and darkest day of the year was viewed as a time when the dead would have access to the living. The telling of tales at Yuletide began to decline as TV took over as the main form of household entertainment, but it must also be remembered that when Dickens published A Christmas Carol in  the tradition of Christmas itself was also in decline. In fact, for most people in that era Christmas was a working day because the Industrial Revolution meant fewer days off for everyone. As a result, Christmas was considered relatively unimportant and no one really complained. googletag.cmd.push The beginning of disregarding Christmas had come courtesy of Oliver Cromwell around  years earlier. The puritanical Lord Protector of England who in the th Century was “on a mission to cleanse the nation of its most decadent excesses.” These excesses unfortunately included banning Christmas celebrations, its ghostly tales and traditions with even carols making his draconian hit list. Oliver Cromwell is of course remembered in Ireland for his other exploits including the deaths of thousands of people as the result of his orders. But despite his best efforts he failed to quell the traditions of folklore carried over from pre-Christian Ireland. In the Irish tradition, ghosts are called taidhbhse or tais and live in a place halfway between this le and the next. The spirits are held here by some earthly affection or unfulfilled duty or anger against the living. Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture, and in every way trying to attract attention. It was also believed that when the soul has left the body, it is drawn away, sometimes, by the fairies. Such souls are considered lost. If a soul eludes the fairies, it may be snapped up by the evil spirits. The weak souls of young children were especially in danger. In western Ireland for example, people sprinkled the threshold with the blood of a chicken when a very young child died so that the spirits may be drawn away to the blood. A ghost was also compelled to obey the commands of the living. One old tale said, the stable-boy up met the master going round the yards after he had been two days dead, and told him to be away with him to the lighthouse, and haunt that and there he is far out to sea still. Oscar Wildes mother who studied and wrote about the supernatural thought it was only spirits who were too bad for heaven, and too good for hell, who were caught halfway between paradise and damnation. It was also thought that the souls of the dead sometimes took the shapes of animals. They will sometimes take the forms of insects, especially butterflies. If you see one fluttering near a corpse, that is the soul, and is a sign of its having entered upon immortal happiness. The author of the Parochial Survey of Ireland, , heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly, How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather. Spirits who remain inside houses can also take on many shapes, including that of the elf and sometimes also of a rat, cat, or black dog. In their natural state they are invisible to people, but they can become visible in these forms. They make a lot of noise in the house at night and live between the walls, in the attic or in the cellar, in the stable, in the shed, sometimes even in a large tree beside the house. These ghosts are not considered particularly intelligent, and remain friendly as long as they are treated well. They like to tease lazy people by pulling the blankets off their beds and sending icy drafts through the room. They also delight in knocking over milk pails and keeping people awake by constantly tapping on the walls. When made very angry, they become malevolent. Their noise making becomes unbearable they throw stones, the cattle become sick, drought or cold weather or continuous storms occur. They leave the house or farm only when it has been totally overwhelmed by disaster and is lost. And, there is a well-known local wintry ghostly tale which refers to The Lady in the Snow which is said to have happened on the outskirts of Derry. The story is of two children, a brother and sister who were playing in the snow near a small stream near Enagh Lough. They were making a snowman and gradually they moved closer and closer to the water until they were standing on the ice. A woman dressed in a grey coat and a fur muff approached them, warning them of the danger. She coaxed them back to the bank just as the ice began to crack. She asked where they lived and she advised them to go home. The little girl askedshe could walk home with them andshe could put her hands in the muff to make them warm. The woman put the muff on the little girl and they chatted as they walked. She told them that she had a little girl who went into the water through the ice and warned them to be careful. At the gate she took her muff back and watched them being greeted at the door by their mother. They were both pointing at the lady and gesticulating but the mother saw no one. However she went to the gate because the children were so convinced that a lady had walked home with them. On the snow there were only the footprints of her children. When the snow melted a muff was found near the lake. The little girl knew it was the one that the lady wore.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money. Anything bad that happened on New Years Eve was considered more signicant the closer it was to midnight. It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done. It was also important to begin the New Year with a spotlessly clean house signying a fresh start to the New Year. New Years Eve was also known as “Oiacuteche na Coda Moacuteire,”- ‘the night of the big portion’ since people would eat a larger than normal meal to ensure food in plenty for the coming year. Another way of ensuring plenty was to make a cake which was then pounded against the door of the house three times while a prayer was said by the housewe. This would chase the bad luck out of the house and invite the good spirits in. In other areas the man of the house would take three bites out of the cake and then throw it against the front door, in the name of the Trinity and banish hunger from the house. After this the family would then gather up the fragments of the cake and eat it. Many farmers repeated this ceremony at the door of the byre to ensure plentul fodder for the cows. People tried to ensure that no food was taken away from the house on New Years Eve and beggars knew better than to approach a house looking for food. Another New Years Eve Irish tradition was that young girls put mistletoe under their pillows on New Year’s Eve, in hopes of dreaming about their future husband. On New Year’s Eve night, families would remember those who has passed away that year before by setting a place for them at the dinner table and leaving the door unlatched. Anyone entering the house after midnight by the front door would leave by the back door for good luck. Well into the evening on New Years Eve in Ireland there would always be a small group gathered around the fireplace, laughing and joking. Sooner or later, the conversation would turn to reminiscing about Ireland. The old ones, well on their way with a few glasses of the hard stuff, would get all misty-eyed as they remembered times past and the stories would begin in the light of just the fire and candles burning in the windowsill. There was also an Irish tradition of predicting the political future of the country by checking which way the wind blows at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If the wind is from the west, there is a chance that good fortune will reign that year. If the wind is from the east, however, the British will prevail. And,after the stroke of midnight the man of the house would recite the following verse: “May your nets always be full, Your pockets never empty, Your horse not cast a shoe, Nor the devil look at you In the coming year.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In a cagey encounter, Lavey led three times by two points but failed to convert three second-half goal chances. In the end it was Niall Duggans first point of the competition, in the th minute, that proved to be the winning score. Here is how the Lavey players performed. Jack Scullion – His spill that led to Adam McElwaines point was the only blot on an otherwise perfect competition that saw the converted outfield player keep three clean sheets. A quieter afternoon than what went before. googletag.cmd.push Shea ONeill – Bobbie McGettigan scored - across the previous three games but ONeill held him scoreless. He made a fine catch from a long ball in the first-half and was tough in the tackle. Ryan Farrell – Played in the full-back line on Mark Gallagher and while Farrell conceded possession on three occasions, didnt let him inside. Will feel hard done by on one of the frees he conceded. Joe Duggan – Lined out initially at centre-back on Adam McElwaine but dropped back into his customary sweeper role. Not tested as much as the earlier rounds but still sat back to shut off the space in front of Gallagher. googletag.cmd.push Enda Downey – Started at midfield and won the throw-in at the start of the second-half. His use of the ball and work-rate were equally brilliant, typied by a massive turnover to end a Termon counter-attack. Played mainly as a centre-back but had a spell at full-forward. Niall Duggan scores what proved the winner and won breaking ball from last kick out of game.Better team all round and able to win the grind Title number  out of  for Derry clubs #UMFT @lavey -@CLGAnTearmainn - pic BlzamXeD — Michael McMullan January ,     Ryan McGill – Lined out on Steve McDaid but it was McGill who came out on top of the battle. Popped up everywhere from wing-back to corner forward where he began the move for Jamie Duggan second point. Segdae Melaugh – Adam McElwaine scored a point off him but was replaced early on. Melaugh played in the midfield zone and had the legs to get forward to support the attack. Unlucky to see his goal chance was blocked by full-back Grant. James McGurk – The wing back fired over the opening point of the game and added a second later in the half. Got caught in possession in Termons maroon wall in the second-half but handled the ball more than most. A vital player in Laveys attacking outlet from defence, scoring from play in all three games. Cormac Collins –The Lavey skipper battled well against Jack Alcorn, who scored - against Emyvale. Made an strong run back to foul Conor Black on a Termon surge after Matthew Downey lost the ball with  minutes to go. Was on the end of a goal chance what flashed outside the post. Jamie Duggan – Despite being paired on Ryan McFadden, he scored two fine points while holding the Termon dangerman scoreless from play. He was here, there and everywhere to knit all the pieces of Laveys team together. Patrick McGurk – Small in stature, he was still able to execute one of the tackles of the game to setup Jamie Duggan for a point. Played off Calum Downey as a second inside forward before dropping deeper later in the game. Rory McGill – Had a hand in two Lavey points including a fine catch from a Scullion kick-out on the way to a free for Matthew Downey to chip over. Was strong on the run from defence and played up front in the closing stages. Niall Duggan – While others will grab the headlines, it was Niall Duggan who arguably won the game for Lavey. He had the courage to kick them into a two point lead and when possession was key during stoppage time he threw himself on a vital breaking ball, hurting himself in the process. Matthew Downey – A quieter afternoon in the scoring stakes but dig deeper and Downey had the mentality to work for the team. He won the ball for a Jamie Duggan score and instinctively laid off for Niall Duggans point late on. Had a goal chance brilliant saved by Maguire. Calum Downey – Its hard to remember him not winning a ball played to him over the three games. He was again the perfect focal point for the attack. Was involved directly in four scores of which the two he kicked himself were exceptional in their own way. Niall Rafferty – Came on in stoppage time for Niall Duggan.

He said police had no idea where he had been or what he had been doing or how he was financing himself during that period.Defence barrister, Eoghan Devlin, said the youth could be released to his grandmothers address with stringent conditions to ensure he turned up for court.District Judge Barney McElholm asked where had the youth been during the  days and was told he had been staying at his grandmothers home.The judge said he was being asked to release the youth to an address where someone had “colluded” with him to avoid arrest.He said that was not going to happen and remanded the youth in custody until the next sitting of Derry Youth Court next month. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He said police had no idea where he had been or what he had been doing or how he was financing himself during that period.Defence barrister, Eoghan Devlin, said the youth could be released to his grandmothers address with stringent conditions to ensure he turned up for court.District Judge Barney McElholm asked where had the youth been during the  days and was told he had been staying at his grandmothers home.The judge said he was being asked to release the youth to an address where someone had “colluded” with him to avoid arrest.He said that was not going to happen and remanded the youth in custody until the next sitting of Derry Youth Court next month. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Davis time at the Brandywell was ultimately one of frustration as he made just two starts and five substitute appearances in his brief time at the club.

His close friends and running colleagues tried every trick in the book to ascertain the route for the annual Castlewellan Christmas Cracker, but uncharacteristically lsquoThe Prophetrsquo remained tight-lipped and taciturn. The usual platitudes and prosaicisms were thrown out by way of appeasement, but they threw no light on the course that has been in the planning since January .Phrases like, lsquothere is something for everyonersquo, lsquothere will be a few good climbsrsquo, lsquowe will go through a field or tworsquo and lsquoI still have a few ditches to clearrsquo served only to add intrigue and mystique to the potential route.From am, parking spaces were snaffled up as the growing crowds made their way to collect their numbers, totally unaware of what lay ahead, another unique characteristic of this now iconic event.When we go to races we usually know what lies ahead as it will be the same as the previous year mdash not so with this one.This led to great speculation at registration and the passing of spurious rumours, lsquoIrsquove heard it is Foxes green firstrsquo, lsquoBunkerrsquos Hill is the first climbrsquo, lsquothe gates at Niall Kingrsquos place are open and that can only mean one thing!rsquoThose unwise enough to listen were tormented, while the more sanguine took it all in their stride realising that what would be would be.The atmosphere in the GAA club was electric and filled with excitement as every little corner became a changing space and in the middle of all of this Stevie Rice had set up a stall and had created a monopoly on udderrmint ndash an essential for the discerning runner.With space at a premium, one team had pre-booked the VIP changing facilities in Ned McCartanrsquos front room. Here the gracious, ebullient and effervescent host provided valet parking, bespoke carb-rich pre-race food, handed out warm fluffy towels and proffered words of wisdom and encouragement. The * package was completed with optional dog therapy ndash petting Socks.The  entries were snapped up in a few weeks, such is the popularity of this event among the NI running fraternity.Running in pairs is far from commonplace in what is largely an inidual sport and this certainly brings a welcome new dimension in that you are only as good as your partner and an ill-conceived or sentimental choice could see you standing waiting at the top of a hill, the bottom of a hill or at the finish.The secret lies in getting the right partner, one you know you can work with and whose running skills complement your own ndash a lesson that has still to be learned by a number of this yearrsquos participants.While the event is a great opportunity to dress up, socialise and enjoy the wonderful scenery that Castlewellan has to offer, the racing at the sharp end of the field is seriously fierce.From the moment they were set on their way at the bottom of the Circular Road, the cream rose to the top as the leading teams thundered their way through the town at breakneck speed.Getting good road position at the front is essential for the leading men and women.In , Newcastlersquos Lynch and Hanna were clear winners with a minute and a half to spare over Johnston and Scott of Mourne Runners, with McMullan and Stephens, from the host club, a further  seconds back in third.These three teams were paired once again, but had to settle for second, third and fth respectively. With Hanna in the form of his le and regularly representing Ireland in the hills and Lynch coming off a superb  minute k at the Seeley, they were the in-form team and pre-race favourites.However, favourites do not always win and on this occasion it was Aaron McGrady from East Down and his partner Andrew Barrington, originally from Oban in Scotlandwho emerged victorious.The pair, who run and race together for Victoria Park Harriers in London, were among a group of leaders along the Crow Road.As the course rose steeply after the Moorish Tower, the pair was second behind Lynch and Hanna as they hurtled through the fields towards the Bannanstown Road.As was the case in , the climb over the Playrock Hill would prove decisive and the eventual winners managed to pull away and open a winning lead.However, McGrady admits that once they hit the front, they had to work very hard over the last three miles as they knew the quality of the team chasing them.When asked about the course, the winner said that it was very dferent to previous years, was far less muddy than anticipated and despite the steep hills offered great opportunities for hard fast running.Overall, he considered it to be a well-planned and carefully balanced route. McKinstry was always in contention, but his partner suffered terribly and put paid to their chances of the win ndash they would finish fourth overall.Beechmount Harriers claimed the ladiesrsquo team prize with Sarah Laverty and Catherine Diver finishing in an excellent th place overall ndash all that training up the hill in Falls Park paid off.They were joined on the podium by Hannah Somani and Georgina Wileyand Amanda Perry and Denise Logue .In the mixed category there was a great win for Shalene McMurray and David McNeilly who were th overall and comfortably clear of their nearest challengers and club mates Mari Troeng and Frank Cunningham. Karen Wilton and Andrew Wills of Jog Lisburn completed the mixed team podium.There were male, female and mixed category winners dotted throughout the field and these are highlighted in the results file available on the Newcastle AC website . Well done to everyone who won a prize.Some of the fancy dress was simply amazing and added greatly to the sense of fun that is central to this race. Special mention to the Power family who once again dressed to impress and the three sheep bleated their way around the course under the ever-watchful eye of Bo Peep, the Newry AC crew who were came as the cast of lsquoIrsquom a Celebrityrsquo, but regrettably failed to get out of there and had to complete all nine miles and the Grant family and their friends who looked lsquoCrackingrsquo for the Cracker.Costumes came in all shapes and sizes with superheroes galore and even the odd beach ball shoved up a T-shirt for maximum effect.Before we draw the curtain on this event there are some necessary closing remarks.Firstly, we have to mention some of those who were lsquopale facedrsquo as they crossed the finish line.Among this number were Connaire McVeigh, his brother Brian McVeigh, Noel lsquoWonderwallrsquo Gallagher , Dee Murrayand Patrick Higgins who it would seem invented a new shade of grey.While all of these are notable and honourable mentions, there can only be on winner of such a prestigious accolade.The worthy recipient is none other than Dominic lsquoMad Dogrsquo McGreevy, who by his own admission was lsquoclean burstedrsquo by evergreen Jim Brown before they even left the show field.Whilst cogitating the next day with McVeigh, he noted that there was a distinct lack of climbing in the opening mile which considerably reduced his chances of the overall win.Of course, all of this is pure conjecture, passed on to me by others who were better placed to judge. As these pale faced warriors finished, I was probably getting a drink at Stephen McMullanrsquos pop-up tavern in Leitrim.The day was a great success due to the hard work and planning that took place. Course designer McCrickard would like to thank his incredible team that spent the best park of two days marking ndash Francie McAlinden, Audey McVeigh , Aidan Brownand Donal Ward.Thanks also to the entry management and registration team who did so much work in creating and continually updating and modying the team ndash no small task, the marshals from our own club and neighbouring clubs, the lead cyclists from Shimna Wheelers and Kilmegan CC, the motorbike riders, Robert and Paddy, the finish team and the presentation party ndash too many to name inidually, but you all know who you are.In conclusion, the feedback from the , that completed the course was amazingly positive and a great time was had by all.

However, all that will count for nothing when they walk out at Seaview this afternoon.Sloan knows more than most that cup finals are all about what happens on the day and no amount of preparation or game planning can change that.With Olympic what you see is what you get.There are no prima donnas in the squad and they have all bought into the team ethos ndash one in, all in.The Olympic boss has made a few shrewd signings since last season and the new faces have gelled well with the group.Olympic may have lost top scorer Niall Murray to Crumlin Star, but Stefan Mason has proved more than a capable replacement.Stefan, now in his second spell at the club, joined from Drumaness Mills at the start of the season and his insatiable appetite in a main strikerrsquos role has endeared him to all.He is a nightmare for all defenders as he never stays still and is continually looking for space. He is not afraid to shoot and is also as brave as they come, adding a bit of physicality to his game in recent times.He has formed a perfect partnership with the under-rated Chris McNamara and the potentially explosive Nathan Jones mdash and all three are reliable matchwinners.Paul Dickson, another new signing, first came to prominence a few years ago when he starred for Noel lsquoDixiersquo Deanrsquos emerging Temple Rangers side that famously reached the semi-finals of the Clarence Cup.Since then he has played for Ballynahinch United and Saintfield United, but his adventurous style of play from the back has given Olympic an added dimension to their play.He has been joined in the squad by Anton McGrattan, a stylish midfielder, who gets up and down the park with ease and who is not an easy player to dispossess or put off his game.Basically, the rest of the Olympic remains the same and therein lies the secret of their success. Goalkeeper Ryan Walsh, a member of the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team, has enhanced his growing reputation this season and he rarely makes mistakes.Manager Sloan has the luxury of being able to play a number of formations at the back. Jason Noade is a colossus in the centre of defence with either Stevie McGoran, Connor Reid, Dickson or the highly-rated Dalton Tate flanking him.Midfield enforcer Ryan Noade,he is fit, can also play in the back four, but he, brother Stevie, Shane Murray and workaholic Ryan Molloy make up a formidable midfield unit with McGrattan able to cover any position in the engine room.Olympic have serious strength in depth and James McClean, Aaron McLean, Adam McClean, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Darren Lyons and Reece McConnell are all ready to step up to the markthey are required.However, standing in Olympicrsquos way is one of their own, now making Rathfriland tick.Andy Kilmartin started out at Olympic as a raw teenager with immense talent.He signed for Glasgow Celtic before moving to Glentoran, Portdown and Glenavon where he won an Irish Cup medal.The martinette is now pulling Rathfrilandrsquos strings alongside Newcastlersquos Jonathan Scannell and Downpatrickrsquos Peter Telford and Ruairi Fitzpatrick.Olympic know these players inside out and given a fair wind, they hope to blow Rathfriland away in what promises to be an intriguing final.Coincidentally, this will be Telfordrsquos fth Border Cup final appearance, but he has yet to appear on a winning side.He has lost three finals with Downpatrick FC and one with Kilmore Rec and is hoping that it will be a case of fth time lucky this afternoon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Out.jpg","title":"Out of Africa book looks at richness of sharing humanity together  ","story":"THE latest book by Downpatrick author Dr Stan Papenfus has just been published.Out of Africa has a title that he plagiarised from Pliny, the ancient Roman writer, who wrote: ldquoOut of Africa always something new.The subtitle of this book, lsquoSharing our livesrsquorsquo, derives from an African proverb mdash lsquoA person is a person through peoplersquo. It an also be translated as lsquoA person becomes a person through peoplersquo.The signicance of this proverb becomes ever more clear in the being and becoming of the three story tellers who share their lives with Dr Papenfus.Each one of them expresses and explores the truth of their own experiences and each one has their personal reality confirmed by the events and situations that unfold. In this telling, they also create how they who are and who they can be.Gabriel Makamanzi, from Zimbabwe, specically sees his own problems and dficulties belonging not merely to himself, but to the whole community in which he lives.This community is brought alive for us as he describes it and he expects us to relate it to our own problems and dficulties. In this way, he says, we all work together to discover our own creative freedom and realise our potential.Gabriel notes that le is for love. And yet, without honesty, our personal and shared reality is not reality at all.Instead, it is a pretense and those of us who pretend he sees us ldquoliving meaningless livesrsquorsquo.Dr Papenfus says: ldquoGabrielrsquos story challenges us, as it challenged him, to recognise our own poverty and despair, only to realise the spiritual power and richness of sharing our humanity with each other.The next exploration of time experiences is by Zakele Makaluza, from South Africa. He talks about his arrogance and his refusal to heed the warnings given to him by his ancestors, as they appear to him in his dreams.Zakelersquos experiences also refer to his relationship with bees, but not ordinary bees, rather with those ldquogentlemen of the honeyrsquorsquo sent by his ancestors to remind him of his duties to others, especially to members of his own clan.Dr Stan said: ldquoZakele, in his exploration of his experiences, brings us to an awareness of our own integrity or lack or integrity, in ourselves and in our relationship with others. He realises his potential only after he is persuaded of a certain truth, which he has been denying nearly all his le.ldquoIt is his cousin who opens up his awareness and tells him also that this was an experience that were lsquodestinedrsquo to share.The last person giving his testimony in the book is David Maganda, from Uganda. He came from a very big family and when his father died he was left to fend for himself, especially with regard to earning enough money to pay for his education.Even as a young boy, he secretly took a train from Uganda to Kenya, hoping to make enough money to sponsor his schooling. But, instead, he found himself on a ldquomission impossible as he calls it.He and his friend found themselves stranded and virtually penniless in the city of Nairobi. They had no place to stay, no work and no friends.How are they toto Uganda  They found themselves walking for mile after mile, along long and dusty roads, depending for their very survival on the kindness and pity of strangers. After living through a fierce storm and other hardships, they eventually arrived at the Kenya-Uganda border. Here, in their completely squalid state, they were interrogated by the police, who eventually let them cross the border.Arriving back in Uganda, they miraculously met Davidrsquos friendrsquos sister, who was working at a trading station. And so, at last, they find themselves able tohome.Each of their families get them to promise never again to engage in such a mad exploit.

One thinks of Robert McCartney, Paul Quinn, Kevin McGuigan and the Florida gunrunning. Or even the fact that just weeks ago the PSNI confirmed that the PIRA Army Council continues to oversee the entire republican movement and that they remain weapons and departments — something most unionist parties were tellingly quiet about.Yet in spite of all that there isn’t a suggestion from either the DUP or UUP that they would ever give up on Stormont. Why  Because as far as they are concerned a system which requires power sharing with the PIRA’s political proxies — whose goal is to show that Northern Ireland is a failed political entity — is as good as it gets.Sinn Fein MP cites legal challenges against the A but it is her party who can change judicial review Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"That being the case unionism will continue to be seen as the ‘problem’ when it comes to any political crisis republicans choose to engineer. A younger generation which has grown up in a Northern Ireland where flying the flag of the United Kingdom is seen as at best as impolite and at worse a deliberate act of provocation rather than something they identy with will continue, in greater numbers, to vote for parties which are agnostic on the Union.As unionism reflects on where we will be at the end of the next decade it would do well to reflect on the mistakes made in the last two.

We have to have sufficient public resources to be able to deliver services which recognise the particular circumstances in this part of Ireland and the dficulties we face.\"There are a range of issues which will be discussed in the next couple of days. None of them, I dont think, need to be exhausted ad infinitum, we need to be bring this to an conclusion. There are pressures continuing to mount in relation to public health, health services and the treatment of staff in the health service. We need to get back working again so we can fix those as quickly as possible.\"From Thursday morning a number of protesters stating their opposition to an Irish Language Act being included in any potential deal set up camp outside the talks venue holding aloft union flags.Three years on from the collapse of the devolved government, the Stormont parties have until a January  deadline to strike a deal to revive the institutions.On that date, legislation to give civil servants additional powers to run Northern Irelands struggling public services expires and Mr Smith will assume a legal obligation to call a snap Assembly election.The latest push to restore powersharing broke up the week before Christmas, with UK and Irish governments singling out the DUP as the party standing in the way of a deal.The party rejected the claims, insisting it would not be \"bounced\" into a \"quick fix\" that falls apart when tested.Devolution can only be restored once the DUP and Sinn Fein - the regions two largest parties - agree terms to re-enter a mandatory coalition executive in Belfast.The other three main parties - the SDLP, Ulster Unionists and Alliance - are also involved in the talks process convened by the UK and Irish Governments.While they could take positions in any new executive, their sign-off on a deal is not essential and a government could be formed in their absence, with those parties having the option of going into opposition.Expectations of a breakthrough rose after the DUP and Sinn Fein both suffered bruising results in the general election.With many interpreting the outcome as a public judgment on the parties failure to do a deal, stalled efforts to restore the institutions appeared to gain fresh momentum in December.However, proposals to reform a contentious cross-community voting mechanism in the Assembly have emerged as a key sticking point in efforts to finalise an agreement, with the DUP unhappy about what is being countenanced.The DUP is also seeking changes to ensure the devolved institutions are more stable in future and cannot be readily pulled down.Proposed legislative protections for Irish language speakers are another crucial element of the negotiations.The Stormont parties are also seeking firm commitments from the UK Government on a financial package to accompany theof devolution - money that would likely be targeted at the regions crisis-hit health service.Mr Smith and Mr Coveney were in Belfast on New Years Day for pre-talks discussions ahead of the resumption of formal exchanges with the political parties.Mr Coveney urged the parties to show leadership and generosity.He said the new year offered a chance for a new beginning and urged all sides not to disappoint the public again.The leaders of the DUP and Sinn Fein used their respective new year messages to restate a desire toto government.DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party stood ready to restore devolution through a \"fair and balanced deal\".\"A Northern Ireland that is going to keeping moving forward must be one where everyone feels at home but must also be one where no one feels their culture is being marginalised,\" she said.While Ms Foster warned that a focus on a potential border poll would lead to a \"wasted decade\", Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald insisted a united Ireland was within reach.But the republican leader added: \"There is no contradiction in working for Irish unity and working for the restoration of the Executive and Assembly - they are all part of the Good Friday Agreement.\"The outstanding issues can be resolved. The time for acrimony and ision is over. The time for slogans and soundbites is over. The test now for every party that has talked up getting back to work is to go back to the Executive table and deliver.\"Stormont imploded three years ago this month when the late Sinn Fein deputy first minister Martin McGuinness resigned in protest at the DUPs handling of a botched green energy scheme.That dispute soon widened to encompass traditional rts over issues such the Irish language and the toxic legacy of the Troubles.A logjam over proposals to reform the petition of concern voting mechanism was one of the main reasons a deal failed to materialise before Christmas.It was designed to protect minority rights but politicians have accused each other of misusing it for their own ends.Discussions around change are focused on making it more dficult for one party to use the petition to block controversial legislation.The parties are also considering amending Assembly rules to make it harder to collapse the institutions.try catch  TrendingGame of Thrones NI actor Andrew Dunbar dies suddenlyThe full list of the  Northern Ireland New Yearrsquos Honours recipientsPSNI name man who died in first fatal road collision of PSNI issue  warning after receiving highly worrying video via social mediaYoung man found collapsed in NI woodland on January  has been identied say PSNI -

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

often I think it comes down to the mental approach, having the right focus to stay professional in your preparations despite everything  going on with the holiday season.“From starting out in management I’ve always had my teams in for a training session just ahead of Boxing Day, not so much for tactics or fitness but really just a way of getting the squad together for that final time before the match.“It helps keep everyone sharp and, hopefully, we can get the right result in Loughgall and end the year in top spot.“That is the target as you set goals along the way and sitting first at the start of the new year is a marker which can benefit the squad.”Portadown recovered from defeat to Ballinamallard United with a - success on Saturday over PSNI at Shamrock Park.A Lee Bonis brace alongside goals from Chris Lavery, Adam Salley and Callum Ferris secured victory.“We were - up at half-time but had kept moving the ball around and the final goal was the most pleasing in terms of representing so much of what we work towards,” said Tipton. “It came after a -pass team move - by moving the opposition and maintaining control, eventually players tire and that leads to extra space, which we can try to exploit.“The final goal was the culmination of that teamwork and it was pleasing to see the players still strive towards that at -.”\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"traffic update road closed major disruption expected ","story":"Heres how to get a refund on unwanted Christmas presents -

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.
