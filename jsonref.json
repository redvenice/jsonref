This represents about 3.9 per cent of students, according to the Department of Education. It was a marked increase from the previous report\u0027s 236,000 Covid-related absences recorded on December 9. "},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Charles invites Prince Harry family stay hope meeting Lilibet time","story":"Share this article One said: \u0027The Prince of Wales has been saddened that he hasn\u0027t had the opportunity to spend time with his grandchildren, which he really does miss.\u0027He is a fantastic grandfather and loves playing the role immensely and it\u0027s certainly fair to say he feels there is something missing from his life without the ability to get to know Harry\u0027s children.\u0027This is something he is hoping to remedy which is why he made the gesture for Harry, Meghan and the children to stay with him if they wanted to, whenever they may come home for a period of time.\u0027 It comes as a former head of royal protection warned today that Prince Harry \u0027cannot pick and choose\u0027 when he wants to visit the UK and receive protection.The Duke of Sussex should not be expecting bodyguards supplied to him when he decides to return home, Dai Davies said.The ex-Met Police officer pointed out Princess Anne was nearly kidnapped and her protection officer was shot - but she does not get full time protection.His comments came as sources suggested the Queen will not help her grandson in his demand for security personnel when he comes to Britain.The insiders claimed the Monarch has no intentions of \u0027caving into his demands\u0027 for protection from the Met and Home Office.Prince Harry faced outrage yesterday over his threat of legal action against Her Majesty\u0027s Government.He is seeking a judicial review of the decision to strip him of his UK police protection team, claiming it is too dangerous to visit without Scotland Yard bodyguards.Last night there was anger at the unprecedented legal threat against the government as sources hit back saying: \u0027Scotland Yard is not available for hire\u0027.Mr Davies, who was Operational Unit Commander for the Royals from 1995, told GMB: \u0027He chose to go to America, that\u0027s his prerogative.\u0027And it\u0027s our prerogative to ensure when we look at any aspect of protection, any member of the Royal Family that we actually look and assess it through various security agencies.

The number is a significant jump on yesterday’s daily rise of 74,405 and 193 deaths and on case numbers recorded at the end of the last week. It is the highest recorded daily figure since the pandemic began. Germany now joins other European countries like the UK, France and Italy in recording more than 100,000 new Covid-19 infections on one day.

The letters are confidential, so the chairman is the only person who knows how many lawmakers have actually written them. Johnson will address parliament on Wednesday after his Cabinet is expected to approve plans to end the recent restrictions imposed to tackle the spread of COVID-19 in England. We will have more on this story as it develops.Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific: Fatalities significantly decreased, however, with six deaths recorded for Tuesday, a drop from Monday’s 23 fatalities, according to ministry of health data. The daily death toll for the month of January has averaged 38 fatalities per day with a high of 61 deaths recorded on 3 January. The local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), which runs veterinary clinics, told Reuters “numerous” worried pet owners have been contacting them for advice. “We urge the pet owners not to panic or abandon their pets,” SPCA said in a statement. Scientists around the world and Hong Kong health and veterinary authorities have said there was no evidence that animals play a major role in human contagion with the coronavirus. However, Hong Kong government officials took no chances after a series of recent infections with the Delta variant were traced back to a worker at a pet shop. Hundreds of samples were collected from animals, including rabbits and chinchillas, but only the hamsters tested positive for Covid-19, resulting in officials giving orders for some 2,000 hamsters from 34 pet shops to be put down “humanely”. Vanessa Barrs, professor of companion animal health at City University of Hong Kong, said: Health workers in hazmat suits were seen walking out of pet shops around the city carrying red plastic bags into their vans. Dozens of pet shops were asked to close, while imports and sales of small mammals were suspended. Buyers of hamsters after 22 December, 2021 were asked to hand them to authorities for culling and not leave them on streets. It was unclear how many had been handed in. A hotline for inquiries was set up, while 150 of the pet shop’s customers were sent into quarantine, officials said.It brings the total number of international parcels which authorities say they have detected traces of Covid-19 on to seven, days after attributing one to Beijing’s first case of the Omicron variant.  The CDC in Shunyi district said on Tuesday it had conducted an epidemiological investigation, further testing, and environmental disinfection, finding three close contacts and four secondary contacts of the most recent parcel. It has also tested more than 1,000 people and taken 50 environmental samples.  The news follows an announcement on Monday linking an otherwise untraced case of the Omicron variant to an international parcel sent from Toronto, Canada via the US and Hong Kong. Health officials said 22 traces of the virus were found on that piece of mail, including two on the outer surface of the package, two on the inner surface and eight on the paper inside the document. Nucleic acid testing confirmed the variant was Omicron. 54 environmental samples of international mail also from Toronto were collected, and five were found to be positive, authorities said.Prime minister Scott Morrison unveiled the $55m package that will refund the cost of visa application fees for up to 175,000 backpackers and international students on Wednesday. Under the details of the visa rebate program, the $630 fee for international students will be covered for the next eight weeks, and for backpackers for 12 weeks. Morrison said his message to 150,000 international students and 23,500 backpackers with visas was to “come on down”. He said international students “particularly those who are working and being trained in healthcare, aged care, those types of sectors” would be “incredibly helpful”. The prime minister also said states that still had in place quarantine requirements for international arrivals should consider lifting them to take advantage of the additional staff arriving into the country. “I’d be encouraging them to look at those rules to make sure they can get those critical workers in,” Morrison said.

New Zealand has dispatched two naval vessels with relief supplies onboard. Defence minister Peeni Henare said they were expected to arrive in four days, though could arrive as soon as Friday if the weather holds. Sophie Ford, international response coordinator for the Australian Red Cross, said aid groups were aware of Covid-19 restrictions that require people coming into the country to isolate for up to three weeks, and goods to be quarantined for days. “We’re really mindful that our response doesn’t bring any more problems,” Ford said. A senior Tongan diplomat in Canberra, Curtis Tuihalangingie, told the ABC that there were concerns of “a tsunami of Covid hitting Tonga” as humanitarian relief came to the country.

Last week Taiwan’s CDC ordered that all passengers on long-haul flights from the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Australia and New Zealand would be given a rapid PCR test at the airport immediately on arrival.  On Tuesday the CDC said this process would be expanded to people from other regions, after the process detected a surprisingly high number of apparently positive cases on arrival, including 58 on the first day. Those who test positive are taken directly to hospital or quarantine facility with their luggage. Those who test negative are allowed to continue through the arrival process, which includes a being sprayed with disinfectant, and put in designated transport to a quarantine hotel or facility.  During the two weeks in quarantine (and a subsequent week of mandatory semi-isolation), iniduals are tested another five times - including two PCRs and three at-home rapid tests. Taiwan is maintaining extraordinary measures as part of an apparent Covid Zero strategy, one that has kept life for those inside its borders relatively normal for most of the pandemic.  However the Omicron wave sweeping the planet has also coincided with Lunar New Year, the most important holiday of the year for much of East Asia, when hundreds of millions travel across the region.  Tens of thousands of overseas Taiwanese have reportedly arrived in Taiwan this month, beginning quarantine early to be out in time for the Spring Festival. There are now clusters of community cases linked to Taoyuan international airport and a steakhouse in the city. Of the 17 community cases in Taiwan reported on Tuesday, five are still untraced. Also on Tuesday, the health minister Chen Chih-shung gave a frank indication that people will at some point have to accept the presence of the virus in Taiwan.  Asked about Taiwan’s future strategy, Chen said it was a combination of mask wearing, strong hygiene, vaccinations and quarantine for inbound travellers, but people also needed to prepare for co-existence.The Philippines has experienced a recent surge in infections, which health experts have blamed on the more transmissible Omicron variant.  Various restrictions have been in place to curb infections in Manila, including a “no vaccination, no ride” policy limiting access to public transport. Businesses such as restaurants and beauty salons are also operating at a lower capacity, as are churches and parks. Elsewhere across the Philippines, infections have continued to rise. This includes Davao City, on the southern island on Mindanao, where a major Covid hospital has suspended admissions for non-emergency cases, according to a report by Rappler. Scheduled surgeries have also been postponed at the Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC). Davao region is under similar restrictions to Manila.

Photograph:  Bryan O’Brien A key meeting of the advisory group on planning for the State exams is due to take place on Thursday but don’t expect an announcement on what the format of the exams will look like in 2022.All indications are that the education system is still in wait-and-see mode over calls to deliver a hybrid Leaving Cert much will depend on the level of pressure facing the Government between now and the end of this month.Senior figures are acutely aware that bowing to demands for a choice between exams and teacher-assessed grades may be popular in the short term but could cause all manner of political problems when results are issued next August.Calls for students to be given a choice between exams and teacher-assessed grades have been ramped up dramatically in recent times.One by one, the main Opposition parties have joined in a chorus calling for change, followed by the main secondary school principals’ association.Most significantly, the Irish Second Level Students’ Union has rowed in with an opinion poll which indicates that up to one in three senior cycle students want a hybrid Leaving Cert. The organisation’s formidable lobbying power – aided by social media – pressurised the Government to deliver an alternative to the traditional Leaving Cert over the past two years.Their main argument is that students have experienced huge disruption over the past two years: school closures, patchy remote learning, combined with the volume of teachers and students who have been out for Covid reasons.On the other side are teachers’ unions who support the full return of State exams this year.The unions – who are opposed to assessing their students for State exams – argue that circumstances this year are radically different from previous years and there is no justification for offering additional options.Adjustments to examsThey say schools have remained open this year and that adjustments have been made to this year’s exams to reflect this. Furthermore, they say that the absence of Junior Cert results for a large cohort of students – whose schools do not have a transition year programme – means teachers’ estimated grades cannot be reliably standardised.So, where does the Government stand? Minister for Education Norma Foley has said adjustments to the 2022 exams, which include more choice and fewer questions, depending on inidual papers, take account of disruption to students’ learning experiences.It would, of course, be far cleaner and straightforward for the education system to revert to traditional exams. There may also be scope to make further adjustments to the exams by having fewer questions or placing a greater weight on student projects, and so on.The prevailing political environment, however, is another matter. Taoiseach Micheál Martin said last week that the possibility of a hybrid Leaving Cert had not yet been ruled out and a decision would be made soon by the Government. This was a significant shift in tone. A contingency plan is being drawn up, according to sources.However, there is also recognition that a hybrid Leaving Cert could create a series of new political landmines.A return to some form of teacher-assessed grades will, inevitably, lead to more grade inflation. This, in turn, means CAO points for students will increase and students losing out on places due to random selection. This will trigger a desperate hunt for yet more third-level places to ease some of the pressure. All this at a time when the third-level system is stretched to capacity, according to university sources.Many parents, and students, won’t thank the Government for the current situation, and fewer still will remember it was the Opposition which demanded a hybrid system in the first place.As of now, there is still a distance to travel before decisions are made.

The objective is to keep dogs separate from areas used by bathers during bathing seasons, for health and safety reasons, Mr Diamond said.“This criterion is imperative in all regions where blue flag is operated. The rationale for restricting access of domesticated animals to beaches is that among the most common hazards in bathing waters are microbial pathogens introduced by faecal contamination from humans and animals,” he said.Meanwhile, some politicians in Kerry have said horses will also be banned from Kerry beaches apart from early morning and late evening.‘Nanny state’If the rules are not adopted, Kerry will lose some of its blue flag awards, director of Kerry’s services for beaches and water John Breen said.Promenades and car parks outside the beaches will not be affected.There has been strong reaction and Fianna Fail councillor Johnny Wall, former mayor of Tralee, who was co-opted onto the council seat vacated by Minister for Education Norma Foley when she was elected to the Dáil, said he could not support the proposal.Fianna Fail’s Mikey Sheehy said it had the hallmarks of the “nanny state” .Independent councillor Jackie Healy-Rae, a dog owner, said he feared for the tourism economy. Those with mobile homes on Banna beach would have to keep their dogs “locked up” between 11am and 7pm each day, he claimed.Dog owners looked at places that were dog-friendly in selecting destinations, he warned.He described the provisions as “heavy-handed”. Other provisions in the new bylaws make it an offence to fail to comply with a lifeguard’s directions, and a ban on the use of certain inflatable water devices. Restrictions on lighting fires in dune areas are also being proposed."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Some \u0026lsquodramatised\u0026rsquo shots in the BBC\u0026rsquos The Snow Wolf were implausibleStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"is the end of the covid 19 pandemic in sight","story":"Much of the talk on Wednesday is about when and how Ireland will reopen. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe nightmare before Christmas never really happened. When the Omicron variant of the Sars Cov-2 virus was first detected in South Africa at the end of November, the alarm bells started ringing loudly across the world.The virus had mutated so dramatically in such a short space of time that there were fears it would undo all the positive benefits of the vaccine programme in Ireland and other countries.As the weeks passed, it became clear the virus was indeed infecting those who were already vaccinated and was far more transmissible than any of the variants that preceded it.But there was good news too. Early data from Africa and other countries suggested that people were not getting as sick with Omicron as they had done with Delta or the early strains of the infection.Scientists and medics urged caution, however. It was still too early to say how severe the impact of Omicron would be in this part of the world.But it now seems clear that Omicron has worked in our favour – at least to some degree.Tens of thousands of people were diagnosed with the illness every day at the height of the fifth wave of the pandemic in Ireland but while the numbers in hospitals climbed to in excess of 1,000, those who fell critically ill and ended up in ICU rarely went above 100.Now the case numbers are falling and it looks like the peak of the current wave has come and gone.Much of the talk today is about when and how Ireland will reopen, what Nphet will advise later this week and what the country will look like once the shadow of the pandemic eventually lifts.Today In The News talks to  Public Affairs Editor Simon Carswell and Prof Christine Loescher of DCU about how and when Ireland might re-open and the likely trajectory of the illness in the weeks ahead.In the News is presented by reporters Sorcha Pollak and Conor Pope.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"how the pandemic exposed the myth of the anglosphere","story":"A park bench in Brockwell Park, London, that was taped off to stop people sitting on it in the early days of the pandemic in April 2020. Photograph: Richard BakerIn Pictures via Getty ImagesYes, he might lose his job, US-resident Brits are currently having to explain to neighbours, friends and Uber drivers. Yes, the prime minister of the actual UK. Yes, over some office parties of less than Caligula-grade decadence.The bemusement of our hosts is not evidence of their slacker ethical standards. Rather, the problem is that Americans tend to underrate how harsh the UK’s lockdown was for much of 2020 – and how correspondingly provocative Boris Johnson’s breaches of it are.In turn, both countries struggle to believe the severity of the restrictions under which Australians have lived. A bid for “Covid zero” made the place all but unvisitable at times, even for passport-holding expats. Melbourne had no fewer than six lockdowns. Unable to renew his near-monopoly on that city’s Grand Slam tennis tournament, Novak Djokovic can attest to the strength of feeling there.All of which gives rise to a question. If there is such a thing as an “Anglosphere”, bound by a deep-seated culture of inidualism, why did the member nations erge so much over the pandemic? Aukus, a naval pact agreed between the three countries mentioned above last September, breathed new life into the idea of English-speaking unity.But the past two years have more often argued against it. The gamut of pandemic measures runs from the relative laxity of the US to, in the case of Australasia, perhaps the severest lockdowns in the western world. Some local authorities in Britain were taping up park benches to prevent strangers sharing them. Try doing that in Dallas or Miami. To the extent that Covid has served as an audit of national cultures, the findings refute the idea of a Washington-to-Wellington communion of values.For the US, with a $21 trillion economy and no express need for the outside world, this is an academic point. But for a midsized nation that has spurned its own continental market, on the hunch that its English-speaking former colonies can step in, the tenuousness of any Anglosphere is more troubling. It implies that national interests still trump (for want of a less loaded verb) ancestral fealties.Steel tariffsTellingly, the US still has steel tariffs on the UK, but not on the EU. Washington’s trade representative Katherine Tai is “confident that we will take this up when the time is right”. It is not known whether she was ruffling Johnson’s hair and praising the quaintness of Regency costume dramas while uttering those words.I spent long enough in Westminster to anticipate the Conservative response here. That is, a Republican administration would have been more generous to the UK. And so we have the paradox of the “special relationship”: it is at once fundamental and entirely dependent on whoever is in the White House.If any good comes of the past two years, it will be a sense of realism in Britain and elsewhere about the US. It is not, as even the French presume, an “Anglo-Saxon” country, whatever that means. It does not share political culture or institutions with the white Commonwealth. First, it broke from colonial rule much earlier and more absolutely than Australia, Canada or New Zealand, none of which are republics. Second, it absorbed such vast and such varied immigration as to become its own category of nation.Whether the events of 1776 constitute a “revolution” (Gore Vidal, noting that the domestic social order was not turned upside down, preferred the term “separation”), they ingrained a mistrust of the state. The consequences are evident in good ways and bad.“A Latin-Slav mixture”, one UK premier called America, and that was in the 1950s. In other words, even if you are a crude ethnic determinist, it makes no sense to assume an automatic coincidence of world views between the US and other countries that happen to speak English. It makes even less to bet your nation’s economic future on it. And given that the US accounts for the lion’s share of the population and economic output of the Anglosphere, that putative grouping has no meaning without it.AmbivalenceThe uniqueness of the US is recorded here with due ambivalence. On the one side, American inidualism prevented the most heavy-handed pandemic measures. It is increasingly plausible that the taped-up benches and Zoom-only funerals had a scarring effect that Britain and other nations will be reckoning with for years.On the other side, there is a pandemic death toll that now well exceeds that of the American Civil War. Either way, as Anglosphere enthusiasts struggle to accept, the US is different. It is not an overgrown Britain. Those who fawn over it most, understand it least. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"In one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"economic storm clouds gathering","story":"Amid his many travails, Boris Johnson must hope that a few more days will see the “partygate” furore subside, assuming the inquiry by the senior civil servant Sue Gray provides the wriggle room to escape. But it will be but a temporary reprieve before the economic storm clouds start to gather in the spring.Arguably, they are already here. An analysis by the Resolution Foundation think tank suggests that, for the third time since the financial crash of 2008, real wages are falling once more and began to do so way back in June.With inflation expected to hit 6 per cent as taxes go up and energy bills double, the painful impact on household budgets is easy to foresee. Yet just a few months ago at the Tory conference in Manchester, Mr Johnson was extolling the emergence of a high-wage, post-Brexit economy. At the time, shortages of labour, especially drivers, were expanding pay packets. Bosses were told that their reliance on cheap imported workers had to end and they needed to “invest in their people”.On the jobs front there is better news, confounding fears that the pandemic would cause mass unemployment. In fact, employee numbers are at record levels though much depends on what sort of jobs these are. If they are predominantly in low-paid sectors, declining real wages will be problematic.Furthermore, the state itself is a drag on the economy with public sector productivity falling as vast sums were ploughed into the NHS and elsewhere to combat Covid. Mr Johnson is hopeful that a spurt of economic growth will be the harbinger of a high-wage economy in the run-up to the general election. As yet there is little sign of it.More from NewsOmicron symptoms: How long they last and how the Covid variant differs to previous strainsMan killed and several injured after bridge collapses in LancashireDairylea advert banned for showing children eating upside downTonga volcano: Scientists warn of \u0026#39unprecedented\u0026#39 environmental disaster with acid rain and ashAsia could replace Europe as the top destination for art lovers to view Monet masterpiecesThe nihilistic New Puritans are killing off our cultureMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lgbt veterans share experiences serving ban gay troops","story":"The Government has launched a review into the experience of LGBT veterans who served during a ban on gay troops in order to learn from their experiences.The independent review, part of the Veterans\u0027 Strategy Action Plan, will seek to understand how the pre-2000 ban impacted gay personnel in the military.The Government said it would provide an opportunity for it to better understand the lived experience of LGBT veterans who served prior to 2000, including how being discharged from the military because of their sexuality affected their lives.It is understood there will be a call for evidence so that anyone with relevant experience comes forward.

the Government’s broadband rollout because it is too expensive to reach them with cables, MPs have warned.The Commons public accounts committee said that ministers appeared to have “no clear plan” for getting connections to the remotest communities, where installing conventional broadband is not financially viable for private companies.The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), which is heading up the rollout, has previously said it is looking at emerging technologies, such as satellites that can beam internet coverage to remote areas.However, MPs warned ministers have not yet produced any details for how such a policy would work in practice.In a report by the committee released on Wednesday, MPs said that without a plan and funding from the Government, broadband companies were likely to miss out on these hard-to-reach areas because of the “prohibitively high cost” of connecting them.The report said: “Accelerating coverage through rollout by commercial operators, rather than by prioritising those areas it knows are hardest to reach, risks some of the areas that need improved connectivity most, being once again left behind.”The concerns come over the Government’s scheme to introduce gigabit broadband, capable of reaching speeds of 1,000 mbps (megabits per second), across the UK.Boris Johnson initially pledged to spend £5 billion so that 100 per cent of the country would have access to such a connection by 2025.However, the Government has since watered down that target, saying it is now aiming to hit 85 per cent of the country in three years with full coverage by 2030.MPs said they were “not convinced” ministers would even meet the reduced target by 2025 due to emerging delays in the contracts it is negotiating with broadband providers.Dame Meg Hillier, the chairman of the public accounts committee, said: “DCMS’ planning and project management here show all the signs of the previous rollout – that the focus will continue to be on the easier to reach areas and there is still no clear plan for the hardest to reach communities.”DCMS could not really explain how broadband has got as far as it has in this critical national strategy, beyond “thanks to Virgin Media”, and it still does not have a real plan for getting the rest of the way to its own downgraded targets.“What DCMS does know full well is it can’t rely on the private sector to get fast broadband to the hardest to reach, excluded and rural areas, and despite its repeated promises to do exactly that we are apparently little nearer to closing ‘the great digital ide’ developing across the UK nor addressing the social and economic inequality it brings with it.”More from NewsOmicron symptoms: How long they last and how the Covid variant differs to

times faster than at other supermarkets, according to a report by Which?The consumer group tracked hundreds of thousands of grocery prices at Britain’s major supermarkets and found that a basket of goods at Waitrose rose by 9.2 per cent last year.This was much higher than the 3 per cent average increase across all eight supermarkets monitored by Which? The cheapest supermarkets, Lidl and Aldi, increased their prices by 5.13 per cent and 4.32 per cent over the same period.Sainsbury\u0027s managed to keep a lid on its prices, raising them by just 0.59 per cent. Tesco increased its prices by 0.89 per cent and Ocado lifted them by 1.62 per cent.Which? found that a basket of 22 typical items would have set consumers back by £32.85 in December. This is more than £9 dearer than Lidl, where a similar basket cost £23.29. Waitrose was consistently the most expensive supermarket across the year, with a basket of everyday items costing between £6 to £10 more each month.Lidl was the cheapest supermarket last month, just beating Aldi, where the average basket cost £23.64 in December. Overall Aldi was the cheapest supermarket for six of the 12 months while Lidl was the cheapest for five. However, the report noted that even prices at Aldi and Lidl rose between January and December last year and in both cases at more than the average rate.A separate report published recently by the data company Kantar found that grocery price inflation reached 3.5 per cent in the four weeks to December 26, which equates to an extra £15 on shoppers\u0027 average monthly grocery bill.Grocery prices are expected to rise even more sharply this year as rampant inflation drives up the cost of living for households across the country. Businesses across the economy are already passing on rising costs to consumers in the form of higher prices but the latest findings suggest that some are more concerned about squeezing household budgets than others.Ele Clark, retail editor at Which?, said: “No one wants to overpay for basic groceries, especially when a cost of living crunch is putting extra pressure on household budgets.”“Our findings show that while prices are going up, some supermarkets are passing their rising costs onto shoppers more than others. “As well as choosing a supermarket that is cheap overall, other ways to save include swapping from branded to own-brand products, sticking to a shopping list and resisting the temptation to pick up special offers you don’t need.”The Which? basket of goods included a mixture of branded items, such as Kenco coffee, Oxo stock cubes and PG Tips tea bags, as well as own label products. Researchers found that some own-brand product categories rose sharply across all supermarkets. Royal Gala apples rose the fastest, with prices climbing by 14 per cent. This was followed by free-range eggs at 12 per cent and brown onions at 11 per cent. Skimmed milk was up 10 per cent and semi-skimmed milk up 9 per cent.A Waitrose spokesperson said: We\u0027re working hard to deliver great value, offering ethically sourced, great quality products at fair prices along with excellent service from our partners.The analysis included Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Aldi, Lidl, Asda, Ocado and Morrisons.More from NewsOmicron symptoms: How long they last and how the Covid variant differs to previous strainsMan killed and several injured after bridge collapses in LancashireDairylea advert banned for showing children eating upside downTonga volcano: Scientists warn of \u0026#39unprecedented\u0026#39 environmental disaster with acid rain and ashAsia could replace Europe as the top destination for art lovers to view Monet masterpiecesThe nihilistic New Puritans are killing off our cultureMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wednesday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"A plot to oust Boris Johnson has emerged, as Tory MPs first elected in 2019 turn against him. Angered by Downing Street partygate allegations, a group of 20 rebel Conservatives - many representing former Labour heartland Red Wall seats - met yesterday to consider the Prime Minister\u0027s fate in a gathering nicknamed the pork pie plot. Political Editor Ben Riley-Smith has details of what was discussed.

Work-from-home guidance and Covid passes for nightclubs are expected to go on January , though reports suggest face mask rules on shops and public transport will stay. Face masks in school, travel tests on arrival to the UK and daily contact tests could all also be eased.Health Secretary Sajid Javid today said he is cautiously optimistic that the Government can substantially reduce Covid restrictions next week - while No hinted an announcement is due within days. He told MPs it’s likely we have already reached the peak of the case numbers of hospitalisations as ministers prepare to review Plan B measures next Wednesday. Mr Javid is the third minister in a week to sound hopeful about lting Plan B measures.  New positive Covid cases have fallen % in a week with , recorded yesterday, and hospital admissions have plateaued. But deaths are still up % in a week to , and , people were admitted to hospital with Covid yesterday alone.Sajid Javid told the Commons: The action that this Government has taken in response to Omicron and the collective efforts of the British people have seen us become the most boosted country in Europe, the most tested country in Europe, andthe most antivirals per head in Europe.That is why we are the most open country in Europe. I have always said that these restrictions should not stay in place a day longer than absolutely necessary. Due to these pharmaceutical defences and the likelihood that we have already reached the peak of the case numbers of hospitalisations, I am cautiously optimistic that we will be able to substantially reduce restrictions next week. Here are all the changes that could happen, or have happened already: Working from home guidance Since December  people have been urged to “work from homeyou can” in England. This guidance, which is not legally binding, is a key way of getting cases down - but the government says it has “immediate costs to the economy”. Tory ministers have repeatedly emphasised how much worth they place on going into offices in person. As such, it is a key measure the Prime Minister will want to get rid of when England’s Plan B rules are reviewed.  Covid vaccine passes at nightclubs and big sports Since December , nightclubs and large events like gigs and football matches in England have had to ask punters for proof of either a vaccine, or negative lateral flow test. But the law that enforces Covid ‘passports’ expires at .pm on Wednesday  January. Boris Johnson would likely need to put any extension to a vote - and last time around  Tory MPs rebelled.The Prime Minister is already battling for survival over Downing Street parties, and another huge revolt could be fatal. Mr Johnson had suggested the definition of ‘vaccinated’ for a Covid pass would be updated from two to three doses. This has already happened in Scotland as of January  - but it will not necessarily be the same in England. Officials are still waiting for many people who caught Covid in December to get a booster, as being infected triggers a -day ban on getting jabbed. But face masks in shops and on trains might stay Face masks were made compulsory in England in two waves through winter, first on public transport, then in shops. They are also mandatory in shopping malls, taxis, banks, post offices, hair salons, barbers, nail salons, pharmacies, vets, auction houses, takeaways , estate agents. But these face mask laws came before Plan B, and reports have suggested they could outlast it too. Sunday newspapers have claimed some face mask restrictions could be extended beyond January .  Masks in schools axed Englandaposs secondary schools have told students to wear face masks in the classroom since January . But reports suggest this rule will be axed around the time Plan B is eased on January  - or even before that date, as it’s not formally part of Plan B. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said on Sunday: “I don’t want to see masks in the classroom for a day longer than is necessary. “And on January  we’ll review that and I hope we’ll be able to take it away.” Travel testing axed for the vaccinated Vaccinated travellers will soon be allowed toto the UK without taking a Covid test at all,a change gets the go-ahead. Currently vaccinated travellers must take a lateral flow test within two days of ing to Britain. Anyone who tests positive must isolate for ten days, although this can be cut short with a negative lateral flow test on days six and seven.But it’s understood Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is looking at removing this last UK test requirement for vaccinated travellers by the end of January.If so, it is likely to coincide with the review of the plan B measures on January . Unjabbed travellers would still need to take UK arrival tests - and of course, British tourists may still have to take tests when heading abroad, depending on which country they go to. Daily testing for Covid contacts cut The self-isolation period for people with Covid was shortened this weekto at least five full days in England. Butyou’re a contact of someone with Covid, the rules haven’t changed yet - you don’t need to isolate, but you do need to take a daily lateral flow test for seven days. When isolation changes were announced last week, the government said it would review this guidance - hinting it could be cut to five days too.The government said it would “consider the guidance for close contacts of people with COVID-, including around the advice for fully vaccinated contacts to take daily LFDs for  days.”So far no change has been announced. … And the changes already confirmed Covid isolation cut to five full days in England The Covid isolation period in England has been cut to five full days since January .Previously people who tested positive for Covid could be freed midway through their seventh full day of isolation,they test negative on days six and seven. That period has been cut by between  and  hours, after huge pressure from Tory MPs and a staffing crisis in the NHS.Under the new rules, people in England with Covid must isolate for at least five full days. They will then be able to leave isolation at the start of the sixth full day -they have tested negative for Covid on both Day  and Day .Your first full day of isolation starts at .am, the calendar day after you test positive or show symptoms. Soyou test positive at am, aposDay apos starts  hours later.This means the new total isolation time is, in reality, somewhere between five and six days depending on what time you went into isolation. UK Health Security Agency data shows around two thirds of positive cases are no longer infectious by the end of Day . This rises to %people have two negative lateral flow tests,  hours apart. In Scotland and Wales, the isolation period is still seven days . Booster vaccines for - and -year-olds All eligible - and -year-olds are able to book a Covid booster jab from January .Previously, boosters were only recommended for clinically vulnerable  and -year-olds who are most at risk from Covid-. But recent data from the UKHSA showed two doses were not enough to stop people becoming unwell from Omicron.More than , in the age group in England have had their second jab, so will be eligible for a booster. However, not all are eligible now, as they still have to wait until three months since their second dose. About , teenagers are newly eligible now, and many of the rest should become eligible in the coming weeks. Omicron restrictions relaxed in Scotland Scotlandaposs limit on football matches and other outdoor events has been scrapped from January .Football matches and other outdoor events in Scotland were limited to only  people from December , meaning Boxing Day games were effectively fan free and Hogmanay festivities were axed.That -person limit has now been axed - followed by all other Omicron restrictions in Scotland from next week. Omicron restrictions relaxed in Wales Covid restrictions in Wales are being eased over the next two weeks, the Welsh Government has confirmed. Since Saturday, as many as  people have been able to attend outdoor event activities - rising from . And from this Friday  January there will be no limits on the number of people who can take part in outdoor activities. Nightclubs could reopen from January , which is when alert level  restrictions will come in to force for indoor restrictions.

The deputy Prime Minister, who is in charge of the justice system, referred to a May  gathering as a “party” in a nightmare interview with Sky News - before hurriedly backtracking. In an echo of his claim the sea was closed when he spent the fall of Kabul on holiday, he also complained claims the bash was thrown in his honour were “nonsense” because “I wasn’t invited”. Twitter users compared the Cabinet minister to Private Pike from Dad’s Army while shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said: “Itaposs like an episode of Columbo, ‘thereaposs just one more thing, Mr Raab…’.” It came as two serving ministers broke cover to offer criticism of the PM’s No operation - after six backbench MPs called for him to resign. Science minister George Freeman said people in positions of power shouldnapost seek to escape public responsibility or accountability, adding: The prime minister and his office should set the highest standards. Health minister Maria Caulfield said that whether or not rules were technically breached, the spirit of the rules was broken. Mr Raab was dispatched to defend his boss after ex-aide Dominic Cummings said Boris Johnson lied to Parliament about a BYOB gathering on  May .The Prime Minister told MPs he “believed implicitly” it was a work event. But Mr Cummings said principle private secretaryMartin Reynolds agreed to speak to Mr Johnson ahead of the event when another official said on e-mail that it broke the rules.Mr Cummings also said he personally raised the “drinks party” withBoris Johnsonand called No a “madhouse” but the Prime Minister waved it aside.Askedthe Prime Minister should resignhe lied to Parliament, Mr Raab told Sky News’ Kay Burley: “I’m not going to speculate on hypothetical situations.” Askedhe was aware of a drinking culture, the Justice Secretary replied: “No.” But he added: “People were working extremely long hours, so it doesn’t surprise mepeople, as you see in other walks of le, had a glass of wine or beer at the end of a very long week.”  Mr Raab then remarked: “There was speculation that the May  party was held in my honour to thank me, it’s just ridiculous.” When Kay Burley exclaimed “so it was a party!” he replied: “No, exactly, er, no, er, the, no no no no. “This is the claim that was made, it was nonsense, I wasn’t invited and I didn’t attend.”Speaking to Times Radio, the deputy PM defended Boris Johnson saying: Look, the suggestion that heaposs lied is nonsense.Heaposs made it very clear to the House of Commons, took questions on this, that he thought it was a work event.“Of course, Sue Gray is looking into all of this, so Iaposm not going to start commenting on every little snippet that is further trailed in. “Thataposs precisely why we have a proper investigation. And thereaposll be full transparency when it reports.” Mr Raab accepted “double standards” are “toxic” and he was well aware of public anger about the Downing Street bashes. But he claimed: “I think there is something of a caricature that is being depicted against the incredibly professional, dedicated, hard work that I saw.” Mr Cummings claims he toldBoris Johnson“you’ve got to grip this madhouse” after the invite was sent out asking around  staff to attend the BYOB party at No.He says at least two senior officials told Boris Johnson’s Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds to cancel the garden party on May , . Mr Reynolds then allegedly checked with the PM whether the event could go ahead, and was told that it could. Mr Cummings, a bitter foe of the PM since his departure from No in November , also claimed he had challenged Mr Johnson himself. If true, this means the PM lied to the house in his apology last week. The Ministerial Code says: Ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister. Mr Johnson attended the party, it is understood with his we Carrie. He sparked widespread ­disbelief last week atPMQswhen he claimed he “implicitly believed” it was work related.In response to Mr Cummings’ claims, a No spokesman said last night: “It is untrue the Prime Minister was warned about the event in advance. As he said earlier this week, he believed implicitly that this was a work event. “He has apologised to the House and is committed to making a further statement once the investigation concludes.” But Mr Cummings’ allegations will increase the jitters of Tory MPs.  Senior Tory MP Steve Baker said his constituents were “about  to one against the PM” over the parties row. The MP said “rule-makers must obey the rules”, but he said he would wait for Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray’s report before taking any action. Several MPs told the Mirror they had received hundreds of emails from furious constituents about the PM’s apparent rule-breaking. Others said their local associations had urged them to put in a letter to kick off a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson. One Tory told the Mirror: “The PM is fatally damaged, way beyond repair. Activists are refusing to campaign at the local elections until he is gone.” Sue Gray, whose report is expected later this week, is ­understood to have interviewed Mr Johnson, and No sources claim he has “shared what he knows”.

The senior civil servant is said to believe that for her inquiry to be seen as credible she has to speak to all key witnesses. While it is not yet clear whether she has already been in touch with the PMaposs former closest aide, she plans to be before publishing her findings into Downing Street gatherings. One source said: Sue wants the inquiry to be as robust as possible. Cummings is going to be interviewed by the time the inquiry concludes. It would be extraordinarywe went through the whole thing and no attempt was made to interview him.In explosive claims, Mr Cummings had said that the PM had waved aside concerns about the rule-busting gathering which then went ahead.  He claimed that he and other eyewitnesses would be willing to swear under oath that senior officials had warned the event was against the rules.Mr Johnson sparked widespread disbelief last week at PMQs when he apologised for the gathering but claimed he implicitly believed it was work related.The under-fire PM broke cover for the first time in days on Tuesday to insist that he hadnapost lied to Parliament. In his clip to broadcasters, Mr Johnson confirmed that he had also been interviewed by Ms Gray. I do humbly apologise to people for misjudgments that were made, he said. But that is the very, very best of my recollection about this event. Thataposs what Iaposve said to the inquiry.  Mr Johnson claimed that nobody told me that the boozy lockdown bash in the No  garden broke Covid rules. Downing Street has fiercely denied the claims, backed up by several senior journalists, that two officials told the PM the event was “a party” before it happened.Deputy PM Dominic Raab said on Tuesday that Mr Johnson would normally be expected to resignhe had intentionally misled Parliament. But he dismissed the claim by Mr Cummings, who has become the PMaposs fiercest critic, that the PM had lied to the Commons as nonsense. However, Mr Raab described the event as a party before rapidly backtracking. Many Tory MPs are believed to be waiting for the result of Ms Grayaposs inquiry, which could be pushed back until next week, before deciding whether to trigger a confidence vote in the PM. Exactly  letters need to be submitted, with reports suggesting that around half that number are already in.

By putting up taxes, particularly National Insurance, and refusing to suspend VAT on energy bills, the Conservatives demonstrate with crystal clarity that they are not on the side of hard-working families and pensioners. As Money Saving Expert guru Martin Lewis points out, there is another way. The Conservatives are simply guilty of making bad, wrong choices. Slashing the spending power of households is doubly cruel after all that families are going through because of the Covid pandemic. Our economy is considerably weaker than the partying Prime Minister pretends. Reduced living standards will be one of many legacies of Conservative mismanagement their successors will have to deal with. Big dog’s done  If attempting to misuse the Royal Navy and dismantle the BBC are first glimpses of “Operation Save Big Dog” then the sooner Boris Johnson is put out of his misery, the better for Britain. The Prime Minister’s clumsy attempts to sht public attention from his law-breaking parties only emphasise what an untrustworthy, incompetent lightweight he is. Warships are for war, not for turning back desperate migrants in the Channel. And punishing the BBC for reporting his No boozy bashes is the revenge of a thin-skinned tyrant. Johnson demeans the great office of state to which he now clings. Princely deed  Family rts are painful in private – and excruciating in public. So decent people everywhere will wish the Prince of Wales well in his quest to improve the painfully strained relations with his son.

As many as  of the  intake of Tories reportedly plan to submit letters of no confidence in the PM tomorrow. One Tory said: “His time has gone.” And the partygate probe is to quiz Dominic Cummings who alleges Mr Johnson lied to Parliament.Angry Red Wall Tories are plotting the PMaposs downfall over the partygate scandal.The Mirror understands that more than  Tory MPs who were elected at the  election met at Westminster to conspire over the Prime Ministeraposs future. With the Tories teetering on the brink of civil war, one frustrated minister dubbed it the apospork pie plotapos as the MP for Melton was alleged to have been one of those involved. Another rattled Cabinet minister branded the Red Wall MPs a load of fu***ng nobodies in comments set to hammer relations still further.  One Tory MP was quoted as saying: “His time has gone.” Another said: “I think we’ve done it... The whips operation completely backfired. Colleagues now have a sense they aren’t alone.”In another blow for the PM, the Mirror learned that Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray will interview Dominic Cummings before presenting her findings into Downing Street parties.A Government source said: Sue wants the inquiry to be as robust as possible. He is going to be interviewed by the time the inquiry concludes.Mr Johnson has been accused of lying to the House of Commons by claiming he thought that a bring your own booze garden party on May ,  was a work event.In explosive claims, Mr Cummings had claimed the PM waved aside concerns about the rule-busting gathering at the height of lockdown. He claimed that he and other eyewitnesses would be willing to swear under oath that senior officials had warned the event was against the rules.  In a deeply uncomfortable broadcast interview, Mr Johnson claimed that nobody told me the No  garden party was against the rules. This was even though his own Government drew up the rules which millions of other Brits had followed at the time. The PM, looking pale and drawn on a visit to a North London hospital, repeatedly refused to rule out resigninghe was found to have misled Parliament. Well, letaposs see what the report says, he said.Mr Johnson sparked widespread disbelief last week at PMQs when he apologised for the gathering but claimed he implicitly believed it was work related. Downing Street has fiercely denied claims by multiple senior journalists that two officials told Mr Johnson the event was “a party” before it happened. Dominic Raab claimed that Mr Johnson would normally be expected to resignhe intentionally misled Parliament.The deputy PM then remarked: “There was speculation that the May  party was held in my honour to thank me, it’s just ridiculous.” When Sky News presenter Kay Burley exclaimed “so it was a party!” he replied: “No, exactly, er, no, er, the, no no no no. “This is the claim that was made, it was nonsense, I wasn’t invited and I didn’t attend.”  Rishi Sunak, tipped as Mr Johnsonaposs most likely successor, gave a lukewarm show of support for the beleaguered PM.The Chancellor said of course he believed Mr Johnsonaposs account to Parliament but refused to give him his full backing, abruptly leaving the interview after being grilled over whether he had lied.Downing Street has launched aposOperation Red Meatapos, a slew of policy announcements designed to appeal to the Tory base, including on migrant crossings and BBC funding.In another attempt to appease disgruntled Tory MPs, the Government will tomorrow set out plans to relax the remaining Covid restrictions in England. The PM is also claimed to have triggered aposOperation Big Dogapos to save himself by sacking several senior aides. Mr Johnson confirmed that he had also been interviewed by Ms Gray.  I do humbly apologise to people for misjudgments that were made, he said. But that is the very, very best of my recollection about this event. Thataposs what Iaposve said to the inquiry. He publicly apologised to the Queen over claims of two separate parties in No  the night before Prince Phillipaposs funeral, where the monarch was forced to sit grieving alone. I can only renew my apologies both to Her Majesty and to the country for misjudgments that were made, and for which I take full responsibility, he said. Many Tory MPs are waiting for the result of Ms Grayaposs inquiry, which could be pushed back until next week, before deciding whether to trigger a confidence vote in the PM. Exactly  letters need to be submitted, with reports suggesting that around half that number had already been reached. Bury South MP Christian Wakeford became the seventh Tory to stick his head above the parapet and publicly confirm he had submitted his letter. Ominously for the PM, he warned that some of his Red Wall colleagues “have written the letters but haven’t sent them in yet”. Several Tories suggested they would rather wait until the May local elections - in which the party could be hammered - to get rid of the PM. One furious Tory told the Mirror: It’s not Operation Big Dog, it’s Operation Massive C**k. I don’t know where it goes from here.  We are grinding slowly to , butwe get  he will win the no confidence vote and notionally we can’t do it for another year. If there is a leadership contest, Sunak will win easily - but the party will fight like ferrets in a sack. Another Tory MP from an earlier intake said the mood against Mr Johnson was calming down among more experienced MPs and ministers. The MP added: But itaposs not among newer cohorts. Thereaposs a huge generational ide here as there was during the Owen Paterson affair. It will be the newer MPs who bring down the PM. I have never seen anything like it.

No Prime Minister is able to survive for long in high office when they trigger scorn in every home, workplace, cafe and pub. A mate of mine, a retired welder in a red wall seat, sent a reworking of a joke about a dead man at the Pearly Gates and was informed by St Peter the hands on heavenly lie clocks ticked only when fibs were heard. The pointers on those of Mother Theresa, Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela had never moved. “Where’s Boris Johnson’s clock ” inquired the man. “We’re using it as a ceiling fan,” replied St Peter. Sacricing the jobs of Downing Street staff to save his own skin will not work for Johnson. It feels like when nothe is booted out of No  by Tory MPs worried about their futures. Nor is he able to cower in a fridge again as the glass door on the front of No ’s wine-time Friday cooler symbolises the charlatan having hidden in plain sight for too long.  Suitcases of booze smuggled into Downing Street, drunken shenanigans on the eve of the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral and an unprecedented apology to Buckingham Palace have a last days of Rome vibe to them. Labour leads of up to % in the polls are encouraging the opposition to go for the jugular, Keir Starmer justiably accusing the PM of breaking the law and lying. With jilted insider Dominic Cummings orchestrating much of the onslaught, there’s an irony in Johnson as co-author of his own downfall. Labour is aware it should target the Tories as much as Johnson himself when as rising star Wes Streeting acknowledged, the opposition’s best bet’s a mortally wounded PM limping on or the Conservatives will claim they have changed under Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss.What do you think  Have your say in the comments below.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

They successfully played the trick in Government when John Major succeeded Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May followed David Cameron then Johnson came after May. I never bought the Johnson appeal but I understood why many voters did. Brexit, his main pitch, was another lie and anyway even many who wanted to quit the European Union these days avoid talking about the mess. Whatever magic Johnson displayed is gone and isn’t ing. The steady drip of awful rule-breaking, civil servant Sue Gray’s party report, April’s tax rises and soaring energy bills and May’s local elections all threaten fresh blows for a deflated egotist who cut a beaten figure on the ropes at Prime Minister’s Questions. Lting England’s Covid restrictions will earn little credit when he’s lost credibility. Johnson’s political obituaries are being written. Only the publication date is to be decided. History will be justiably unkind to a truly terrible leader.

But while one woman in Russia adores her gorgeous kitten, he takes up a little more room than the average puss. Yulia Minina, who lives in the small town of Stary Oskol, bought gorgeous cat Kefir almost two years ago as a tiny kitten. The Maine Coon, who is named after the dairy drink because of his stunning silky white coat, is often mistaken for a dog because heaposs so enormous, Yulia claims. He weighs .kgand is likely to become even heavier - as Maine Coons tend to grow until theyaposre three of four years old. Yulia said: I could not even think that an ordinary baby can become so big.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here He not only grew up big in appearance, he is also very smart and always behaves calmly. The look is generally like that of a person, and Kefir has a formidable appearance, but he is a very affectionate and modest child. When friends and acquaintances come to the house - all the attention is on him and he willingly allows himself to be stroked. However, when strangers who have never seen Kefir before come to the house, theyaposre confused by the regal creature greeting them at the door. aposaposBut when strangers come to the house, everyone first confuses him with a dog, Yulia said. “He has one more habit: at night he likes to climb on me and sleep. When he was a kitten, it didn’t cause me any inconvenience. aposaposBut now he has become big and heavy, and, of course, it is dficult to sleep like that. At one year and  months old, it seems Kefir will be disturbing Yuliaaposs sleep for years to come. Photos of Yulia carrying her big baby show how enormous he is, almost dwarfing his owner with his huge frame and bottle brush tail. Some people arenapost sureKefir is truly as big as he seems in photos, but Yulia insists: I donapost use Photoshop.

Tiredness is one of those symptoms that has been well documented since the coronavirus emerged and people are continuing to suffer from it.It is possible that asymptomatic people may experience extra fatigue and donapost realise they have the virus. Tiredness may also affect people long after they have had the illness. It can be dficult to tellthe reason you feel tired is that you have been infected with Covid, or you are just tired generally.As the UK switches up its self-isolation rules to just five full days, it is important to be able to tell the dference.How do I knowit is Omicron or just fatigue  Tiredness is a common symptom of Omicron and one to look out foryou think you might be under the weather. ZOE COVID Study said: Feeling fatigued is a very common symptom of Covid- for all age groups.On average, around eight in  adults who are ill with Covid- will experience fatigue. It’s slightly less common in children, affecting around half of those with Covid-.  Consider what you have been doing recentlyyou feel tired all of a sudden.

Most people feel better after a few days or weeks – and most people have recovered within  weeks. But there are those out there who continue to suffer long after they have had the virus.The NHS lists extreme tiredness as one symptom of long Covid, that can last for months after coming down with the illness.Those that experience this should contact their GP for further assistance and can also find a useful guide put together by the NHS here.What are the symptoms of long Covid  Other symptoms of long Covid include:shortness of breath chest pain or tightness problems with memory and concentrationdficulty sleepingheart palpitations dizziness pins and needles joint pain depression and anxiety tinnitus, earaches feeling sick, diarrhoea, stomach aches, loss of appetite a high temperature, cough, headaches, sore throat, changes to sense of smell or taste rashesRead MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The decision was taken at Range High School in Formby to remove the doors over the Christmas half-term over what has been called anti-social behaviour, reported the Liverpool Echo.But no changes have been made to the girlsapos toilets where the doors remain. One Year  pupil at the school said that he doesnapost like the way people can now hear them using the toilet from outside. He said: People donapost feel comfortable using the toilets.  There are cubicles, but the urinals are behind a screen and you can see into the room and hear people using the toilets. Itaposs just created tension in the school.

You will get a dferent answer depending on who you ask. One said because of anti-social behaviour, another said to improve ventilation. Tom Dolly, deputy headteacher at Range High School, told the Liverpool Echo that it was decided to remove the doors due to anti-social behaviour, and he denied that the boysapos privacy is affected.

Professor Andrew Hayward, a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , told Times Radio it doesnapost do the virus any good to increase in severity, though new iants may prove to be even more transmissible than Omicron.He said that any new iant would need to out-compete Omicron through increased transmissibility or escape from immunity, and not through changes in severity.Covid has so far killed over , British people.It doesnapost do the virus any good to become increasingly severe, he said. In fact, it looks like the Omicron iant, by becoming more transmissible, that itaposs also become less severe, and we would hope thataposs the general direction of travel. He said that in future not everyone would need booster vaccines, adding: I think the people that we might want to think about boosting the most are the same as flu really - people with chronic illness and elderly people - and weaposll probably move into a sort of more regular annual vaccination programme, or it may not even need to be that frequent.  We need to wait for the evidence on that. Prof Hayward said he agreed the pandemic will end and people will live with the virus continuing to transmit but causing much less disruption. He added: It will tend to, I think, settle into a seasonal pattern - we may still get quite big winters of infection but not the sort of level where we can justy wholesale societal closedown.  So, I think it is genuinely an optimistic picture, but weaposre still not quite there yet. The University College Londonexpert said there were very encouraging signs of cases plateauing or dropping in some places, but nobody was sure whether they will stabilise at a very high level or dip down. The latest UK data shows , people were reported as positive for Covid on Monday, with the seven-day rolling average showing a % drop in cases in a week.  Meanwhile, hospital admissions remain fairly static, though they are falling in some parts of the country. New data from the Office for National Statisticsis due to be published on Wednesday afternoon which will show the level of infection across the community in people with and without symptoms. Across England there are currently , Covid patients in hospital, down from , a week ago.  Elsewhere, Dr David Nabarro said it is important that there is no premature promising that restrictions will end at a particular time after suggestions the Government will drop Plan B at the review stage on January .The World Health Organisationaposs special envoy on Covid- told BBC Breakfast: Iaposm a public health person ... I would not be making promises some time in the future because, once you make a promise, itaposs super hard then to change what youaposre going to do - you feel youaposre kind of doing a U-turn.This virus is constantly evolving and itaposs super hard to predict where it will be - we can say where we hope weaposre going to go, we can say where weaposd like to go, we can say what we think we need to do to get there - but making promises that weaposll do something on a particular date, I think, is unwise. Dr Nabarro reiterated his view that the situation in the UK gives us grounds for hope but continued to urge caution. The goal that weaposre all aiming for is a situation where this virus is present, but le is organised so that it is not disrupted, he said. We also need to be humble, this virus is continuing to evolve and weaposre never quite sure that we know exactly where itaposs going to go next.

There were  viewers who felt that the girls hanging upside down from a football goal before one opened the cheese snack and ate it, condoned or encouraged behaviour that could be dangerouschildren copied it.Dairylea owner Mondelez UK said the adaposs purpose was to show parents allowing their children more freedom and the video included two supervising parents in the background.  Mondelez referred to a study that they said supported their view that a personaposs ability to swallow was not affected by the position they ate in, including when eating upside down. Based on the research, and because Dairylea was a soft food, they considered there was a very low risk of choking when eating upside down. The ad had also been given an ex-kids scheduling restriction, but Mondelez said they were no longer running it and would remove references to eating upside downthey used it in future. The Advertising Standards Authoritysaid it sought advice from the Child Accident Prevention Trust, whose view was that the scenario depicted in the ad represented a situation where there was potentially a high risk of choking. The ASA also noted that one complainant had reported that their three-year-old relative, after seeing the advert, ate their food whilst hanging upside down. The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  The ASA said: We therefore considered that eating whilst upside down was an unsafe practice and one which could be dangerous for children to emulate. We therefore concluded that a scheduling restriction was not sufficient to reduce the risk of harm and that the ad breached the Code. The ASA ruled that the ad must not appear again, adding: We told Mondelez UK to ensure their advertising did not condone or encourage unsafe practices. A Mondelez spokesman said: We recognise and will abide by the ASAaposs decision but we are disappointed by the ruling. We carefully consulted with Clearcast to pre-approve the content of this video on demand advert prior to airing. It was aimed at adultsrather than young children and was deliberately scheduled away from programming likely to appeal to children under . As such, we believe it was unlikely to encourage aposcopycatapos behaviour by young children.

A poll found that people living there are % likely to have a grumpy neighbour living near them. This was closely followed by Northern Ireland, where residents were % likely to have a grumpy neighbour. In third place was Wales, with a % likelihood. Where in the UK has the friendliest neighbours  If youaposre looking for a nice place to go and feel part of things, % of respondents in the West Midlands said that they felt welcomed by their neighbours.

The study also found that % of Brits would be happy to drop a parcel round to a neighbourit had been left with them, while a third of people would send their neighbour a Christmas card - and % said they would put their neighbouraposs bins out.  But the babs of the West Midlands have still got the sweetest deal, as itaposs the most likely area in the UK for you to receive an invite for a BBQ or dinner. Looking east and the people of East Anglia would be the most likely to have a neighbour who would feed their pet while they are away, while to the south, capital dwellers are the most likely to remember your birthday and send you a card. David McGrail of First Mortgage said: “Having kind neighbours can be really helpful, they are the ones most likely to be able to keep an eye on your property while you have a winter holiday and be around to help you out by taking in parcels. It really is those little things that can make a dference. Whilst it’s hard to put a price on it, good neighbours are worth every penny. “You can find the perfect property, in the perfect location, but after a few weeks you could be wishing you never moved.

Based on Spring Street, the tiny house also has a pocket-sized kitchen-living area and a petite en-suite bathroom, reports the Manchester Evening News.And while this might not seem like anything out of the ordinary, the interior of the property has got people talking online - all because of the dimensions. The propertyaposs half-sized staircase is one particular eye-catching detail - as is the size of the kitchen. Some users on Twitter have blasted the layout of the property, while others say the house has real potential.“Everyone look at this terrible tiny house attempt,” a user named Hannah, tweeting, said. [It has] only two rooms and they’re both the worst use of space I’ve ever seen.  Others said the space made them feel queasy and that it had been built with little thought.

Colin, who has carried out up to  liver, kidney and pancreas transplants, said keyhole surgery has made live kidney donation easier. He added: “Transplant surgery was painful before. It could stop donors going to work and they could develop hernias. Now with keyhole surgery they go home the next day, even the same day. “It’s an important message: we’re born with two kidneys but you only need one.” Geordie Hospital, Monday, pm, C.

Karen Fay, , said she wanted the ground to swallow her up when she could not ride the Nickelodeon Land ride in Blackpool with her youngster daughter Charlotte. Her seatbelt buckle wouldn’t fasten between Karen’s legs, meaning the ride could not start so she had to get off and walk back past a queue of onlookers. After the incident, Karen was so upset she joined Slimming World the next day. The mum-of-two used to feast on pork chops and chips, baguette and crisps and chocolatey snacks washed down with a glass of wine. But since switching to fruit snacks, healthier meals, and gin soda, she has dropped a whopping six dress sizes. After weighing st lb at her heaviest, Karen now weighs a trim st lb and has gone from a size  to a comfortable . “My little girl was four at the time and she wanted to go on the ride, she said. “I wasn’t going to go on, but the guy said do you want to go on it with her as they had adult seats so I said ‘okay, yeah’. “The ride couldn’t start because it wouldn’t buckle. I was absolutely mortied. I just wanted the ground to open up and swallow me. Karen, a director at her family-run specialist cleaning firm, piled on the pounds after having kids and weighed  st lbs after the birth of her second child Charlotte in . After the incident at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in , she decided to do finally something about her weight. She lost three stone following Slimming World’s food optimisation plans, but in  she struggled to reach the pedals of her new car which was another jolt.  Karen, who’s originally from Glasgow but now lives in Morecambe, Lancs., added: “We went back the next year and I made a point of riding the ride and it felt absolutely amazing. “I weighed about  stone, but I knew I could fit on the ride. “I was in and out the doors of Slimming World for a few years and in  we bought a new car and I could barely reach the pedals, I wasn’t comfortable at all. “I was up and down, I’d lose a couple of stone and put a stone back on.” In March , at the start of lockdown, Karen weighed  stone and was attending virtual Slimming World meetings. But when Lancashire was plunged into tier three restrictions in September, she decided she’d had enough of feeling unhappy with her weight and firmly stuck to the plan. By May , she had lost a total of st lbs and hit her initial target weight. But she knew she could lose more and lost another stone by September. Karen added: “I looked at myself in the mirror and I said to myself ‘get a grip’ and I got absolutely stuck in. “I’d started power walking and I had been challenged to do a couch to k in . In April , I ran my first k, it took me  minutes. “All through lockdown I kept up my running every day. The hour’s exercise we were allowed outside I spent running. “The weight started to come off, but I knew I could do more.” Now a slimline st lb, Karen has lost eight inches off her bust,  inches off her hips and a whopping  inches off her waist.  Before, Karen would start the day with cereal and full fat milk or toast with butter followed by a baguette, salad bowl, chocolate bar and crisps and pork chops and chips for dinner. Now she enjoys porridge or wholemeal toast with scrambled egg no butter for brekky, home made soups or pasta for lunch and salmon, air-fried potatoes and veg for dinner. Her snacking habits have switched from crisps and chocolate to fresh fruit and she now enjoys gin sodas instead of wine. Karen credits the dramatic weight loss with changing her le giving her back her self-esteem and confidence. Now a confident runner, Karen completes a k three times a week and looks almost unrecognisable in photographs. And she has trained as a Slimming World consultant which she does in her spare time to help inspire others to follow in her footsteps. She added: “I weighed  and a half stone after the birth of my second child and I was miserable. “My first thought every day was about my size, my weight and what clothes I was going to wear. I never felt comfortable. “I think my whole attitude to le is more positive now. “I’m happy, I’ve been successful at losing the weight and it’s given me a new lease of le. “It’s given me my sparkle back. I had been involved in amateur dramatics and have been on stage, but a lot of the time it’s just a mask. “But now my confidence levels are sky high. I hope I can help other people get their sparkle.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Slimming WorldFitnessWeight loss success stories\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Vet practices in the region shared warnings on Facebook, urging owners to avoid beaches in Scarborough and Saltburn.But it would appear the bug is now moving inland as Brits in towns and cities, including Hebden Bridge, York, and Sheffield, reported similar symptoms. One person posted on a group in Hebden Bridge saying: The dog sickness bug is spreading here like wildfire. My dog came down it on Thursday and I had only taken her to school and back!  The vet said every other dog he has seen has this bug. She said that her dog was fine now but that her motheraposs dog had now come down with the same illness. She said: Just be careful as they donapost know what the cause is or how itaposs spreading. Another person from Sheffield posted saying that there was a nasty bug doing the rounds that will knock your dog off its feet. They added that the virus is spreading like wildfire and is in most areas and had caused her dog to vomit and have diarrhoea, which were similar symptoms to the virus reported from the coast. Emily Storey, from York, warned others about the illness - which she said was taking longer than normal to recover from - after her six-month old cockapoo Loki became ill last week. She said that she had taken him on walks around Copmanthorpe and discovered that other dogs in the area had fallen ill with a similar illness. She said that he was also vomiting and had diarrhoea and that he was not eating properly. She also said that when she took him to the vets she was told that it seems to be worse than usual. In Leeds, a woman was walking her dog at Hunslet canal before it also caught the mystery illness. She said she thinks the virus came from the coast but is now being spread from dog to dog in the city. But one of the vets at the Minster Veterinary Practice played down the idea that a new illness was affecting canines though, saying that she didnapost think there was a new illness in York. She said: We often unfortunately get waves of unwell pets with vomiting and diarrhoea around this time of year, just as in the summer we often get cases of kennel cough. I did mention to a client at Willow Grove that I had seen a few cases of vomiting and diarrhoea, but this can be a normal occurrence this time of year. Any cases that have had to be hospitalised due to vomiting and diarrhoea have responded to supportive care. My main advice to any pet owners would be thatyour pet is unwell then seek veterinary attention,we have a mild stomach upset then a bland diet is little and often is a good idea. Please be reassured thatwe felt that there was something pet owners should avoid or minimise to stop their pet becoming generally unwell then we would advise of this.

Now, Lady Victoria has told how she was befriended by the couple during an ITV documentary, which is due to air at pm today.The -year-old former IT girl said during her time with Maxwell, Epstein kind of sat back and sort of waited for her to sort of go fishing for girls. The daughter of the th marquess of Bristol told how she met the pair  years ago saying she was really young and naïve at the time. Speaking on ITVaposs Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile documentary, Lady Victoria said Maxwell and Epstein were like Batman and Robin and were a double act. She said: Jeffrey was really the frontman and Ghislaine was the accomplice. It was kind of like a Batman and Robin, and they were a double act. I donapost think Jeffrey could have done any of it without Ghislaine. Presenter Ranvir Singh said: And Ghislaine was crucial to getting those girls, was she, do you think to those dinners Lady Victoria responded: I think he just kind of sat back and sort of waited for her to sort of go fishing and go find however many girls were needed, you know, to entertain his friends. I think I was pretty much used as bait.  You know, looking back at, you know I was really young and naïve, and sheaposs entertaining these, you know, big businessmen. So I didnapost realise it of course at the time, but looking back. At one point Lady Victoria appeared to show some sympathy towards Maxwell, who faces up to  years in prison when she is sentenced in June. I think Ghislaine was a victim and is a victim,” she said.  She was a victim that then became the accomplice as her role changed in that relationship when they were no longer together. She kind of switched sides. I do see her as a victim as well.” She added: “She is a scapegoat right now, so unfortunately for her, she is being taken down for what he has done as well. Some might argue is not quite as fair as it could be.” On Tuesday, Lady Victoria appeared from Los Angeles on ITVaposs Lorraine show.  “Shehasn’t really named any new names yet,” she told the host. “I am hoping for the people involved, for a lesser jail sentence, she will start giving out some names. “But I don’t think we are quite there yet, especially with the situation of the jury member.” One of Maxwell’s  jurors, Scotty David, revealed after the conviction he had suffered child abuse saying how it helped shape the ’s decision. It later emerged the -year-old, who appears in the documentary, had not disclosed his past when asked during jury selection. Maxwellaposs lawyers have called for a retrial, claiming the case was unfairly influenced. At one point in tonightaposs documentary, Singh rles through Epsteinaposs black book of contacts. She finds Prince Andrewaposs mobile number and tried calling it only to hit a voicemail. It is not knownthe Duke of York still owns the number. Amanda Knox, who was cleared of British students Meredith Kercher’s death, yesterday weighed in the case saying much of the interest in the Maxwell was because she is a woman. The -year-old said: I do think that part of the reason why thereaposs so much public interest in this case, is because we wanted to hold Epstein accountable, and sheaposs the next best thing. So I was in the one sense, pointing to the fact that, you know, Maxwell was obviously guilty of these terrible crimes and should be held accountable for her crimes. “But also, we should be careful and mindful as a society when we have such raging interest in some cases over others. “And wasnapost this just another example of the reason why we really, really cared about this case was because it was the opportunity to vily a woman for sex crimes.” Read MoreRead MoreFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Ghislaine MaxwellLady Victoria HerveyPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkITVDocumentariesRoyal FamilyJeffrey Epstein\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He protected each and every one of us. Now he wants to do the same for his we and kids, but he’s having to fight for that right.Harry can make all the controversial personal choices he likes, but there’s one thing he can never change. The family he was born into. The result of this, as explained in his most recent ­statement, is that he “inherited a security risk at birth, for le”. If Harry was demanding protection while in the UK for free, the uproar he’s faced over the last few days might be understandable. But he isn’t.  He’s just asking to be allowed to buy ­something he needs. But where your family’s ­essentials might be bread and milk, his are round-the-clock armed protection from neo-Nazis, extremists and everyone in between. He’s more than happy to pay for this himself. Unlike The Artist Formerly Known As Prince Andrew, who may have had a few titles and trappings removed but for whose security we all still foot the bill.There’s an argument thatHarry’s allowed to hire the ­politan Police’s royal protection squad it sets a precedent that any old celebrity or rich, famous businessperson who fancies it can too. Nonsense. Those people have chosen to be recognisable, and so are responsible for themselves. Harry is forever the Queen’s grandson whether he likes it or not.He’s genuinely the exception to the rule. The suggestion he employs a private ­security team is a non-starter. As former royal protection officer Ken Wharfe admits: “It’s next to impossible for independent security contractors to match the standards of police protection. They’re not automatically allowed access to UK intelligence, or given the freedom of royal palaces without the necessary clearance. “In Britain it’s illegal for anyone except police and the military to carry firearms.”  It’s obvious why the safety of his family is something Harry is not willing to compromise on. And also why he’s willing to go to unprecedented legal s to ensure the very best protection available for them. He’s already lost too much. What you think about everything  Harry has done – the way he’s chosen to live his le and how he’s gone about it – is irrelevant. This is a separate issue. And it’s quite simple. Really, although the circumstances are more extreme, he only wants what we all do. To keep his precious loved ones safe. We don’t have to pay for Harry’s security, we just have to allow him to have access to it. After everything he’s been through, all he’s done for this country, is that really too much to ask  Read MoreRead MoreFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Daily MirrorPrince Harry in AfghanistanPrince HarryMeghan MarkleRoyal FamilyThe QueenPrince Andrew, Duke of Yorkpolitan Police Service\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duke of Sussex’s unprecedented move of threatening to sue the government is both breathtaking and utterly baffling. Those in royal circles have almost universally questioned the play at hand, not only in its nature but equally in execution. True enough, with his background in the military and his position in one of the most famous families in the world – and celebrity lestyle – Prince Harry and his family are arguably high profile targets.  But to suggest he is at a greater risk at home than abroad, where he has chosen to base himself, surely holds very little weight. Indeed the manner of this row seems even more bizarre that it is still being argued two years on from being granted his wish to up and leave his royal role, on the understanding that you can’t have everything you want. This is all before even considering the effect on the Queen, who we are told has been made aware of her grandson’s latest bright idea just as she emerges from one of her most tumultuous periods of recent years. She faced her first Christmas without her beloved husband before wielding the axe on her son Prince Andrew’s royal career.What do you think  Have your say in our comments below... The decision to banish him into the wilderness, arguably a couple of years behind schedule, would not have come easy no matter the depths of his fall from grace. Now, just three weeks away from the beginning of her Platinum Jubilee year, Her Majesty is facing down another petulant member of her family for reasons she would be forgiven for assuming had been sorted.

Royal expert Ingrid Seward has said: She explains: Prince Harryaposs threat of legal action against his grandmotheraposs government will not sit kindly with her. The Queen does not like being threatened.During his time as a royal and after stepping down with we Meghan Markle, Harry has made several requests - some that have needed the Queenaposs permission.But there also appears to have been several times, when she has firmly put her foot down... Tiara requestOne request that left Harry overwrought concerned the tiara Meghan wore on her wedding day in May .Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. According to the unauthorised biography Meghan: A Hollywood Princess by Andrew Morton, Harry made his feelings clear when the tiara could not be made available for Meghanaposs hair fitting with her stylist before the big day. He writes: The prince, who needed acupuncture to stay calm in the run-up to the wedding, was overwrought when the chosen tiara could not be made instantly available for Meghan’s hairdresser Serge Normant, who had flown from New York to work on the hair fitting. The Queen’s formidable dresser Angela Kelly, who isof the Queen’s jewellery, is said to have informed the irate prince that certain security protocols had to be adhered to in order to access the priceless piece. A source revealed that he was told: ‘They’re kept under very tight lock and key. You can’t turn up and demand to have the tiara just because your hairdresser happens to be in town.’ Harry would have none of it, telling anyone who would listen: ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.’ His ringing phrase did her no favours. Living arrangements Weeks after Harry and Meghanaposs wedding, the couple faced disappointment when the Monarch rejected a request they made about their home.According to the Sunday Times, the couple asked the Queenthey could live at Windsor Castle.The report, written by Roya Nikkhah states: The couple are understood to have set their hearts at first on Windsor Castle, and are believed to have asked the Queenliving quarters could be made available after their marriage.But Harryaposs granny said no and gave them Frogmore Cottage instead.Hugo Vickers told the Express why the Queen may have decided to deny their request, saying it might not have been entirely appropriate. He writes: There are empty bedrooms and suites in the private apartments within Windsor Castle which the Sussexes may have had their eye on, or perhaps some former living quarters in the castle grounds converted into other things. But I can see how it might not be entirely appropriate to have a young family living there. Military titles  In , Harry and Meghan stepped down as working royals in order to set up a new le in America.And with it, they were stripped of their honorary military appointments and royal patronages.The monarch forced the pair to sever all official links with The Firm after they decided to renounce their duties and step away from public service for good. Among the titles that were taken away was Harryaposs military appointment of Captain General of the Royal Marines. Buckingham Palace said: Following conversations with The Duke, The Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of The Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a le of public service. The honorary military appointments and Royal patronages held by The Duke and Duchess will therefore be ed to Her Majesty, before being redistributed among working members of The Royal Family. While all are saddened by their decision, The Duke and Duchess remain much-loved members of the family. A spokesperson for Harry and Meghan replied and said: As evidenced by their work over the past year, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex remain committed to their duty and service to the UK and around the world, and have offered their continued support to the organisations they have represented regardless of official role. We can all live a le of service. Service is universal. Royal styles As well as being stripped of their military titles and royal patronages, Harry and Meghan also had to agree to not use their HRH styles. Although the pair werenapost stripped of these by the Queen, they no longer use the style as they arenapost working members of the royal family. Remembrance wreath request  In November , Harry made a request to have a wreath laid on his behalf at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday. Despite Harry having served for  years in the military, including two tours of Afghanistan, his request for his tribute to be laid at the London memorial last year was refused.In his book Battle of Brother, royal author Robert Lacey argues most people would consider Harryaposs request perfectly reasonable and a mark of respect but he adds that the Queen is said to have rejected the request as soon as it reached her attention. It took her aposall of two secondsapos to issue a refusal, Lacey writes, referring to an article by royal editor Rebecca English. The article stated the Cenotaph ceremony was sacrosanct to The Queen, who ensured nothing happened without her knowledge. While Harryaposs grandmother hugely admired her grandsonaposs military achievements, his request to lay a wreath, or have one laid on his behalf, showed a lack of understanding of what it means for him to be a non-working royal, the book claims. Security issuesMeanwhile, when it comes to Harry latest request for police protection for his family when in the UK, it has been reported that the Queen wonapost help his case.He and we Meghan, , lost their taxpayer-funded police protection after quitting their royal roles in . The couple, who live in Calornia with their children Archie, two, and seven-month-old Lilibet, fund their own security there. The Duke of Sussex claimed he is effectively in exile because it is “unsafe” for his family toto the UK. He claims his private security arrangements are not enough to ensure his family’s safety and privacy here.A royal source told the Sun : “This is not a matter for Her Majesty. She certainly won’t cave into his demands.“It is a matter for Her Majesty’s government. Who gets protection is not a gt the Queen can decide to give or take away.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince HarryRoyal FamilyMeghan MarkleQueen\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Recorded Covid- cases are on the rise again after around , were reported on January , amid a downward trend. The latest figures show positive Omicron cases have gone back up to ,, so itaposs still important for people to be able to tell when they have symptoms of the virus. Even though the current number of Covid cases are still signicantly less than the beginning of January when the total hit over ,, Covid deaths have soared to the highest in  months as a further  have been recorded in  hours.With this in mind, it is vital cases are kept down in order for le toto something a bit more normal. So how can you tellyou have Covid  Main symptoms of Omicron The ZOE COVID Symptom Study has put together data of the most common symptoms and Business Insider then used to the data to create a list of the full symptoms.The chart is based on when the virus first started spreading among people in the UK.The top two symptoms of Omicron were a runny nose and a headache. These cold-like symptoms are dferent to that of what most people experienced with the Delta iant.% of people had a runny nose, while % said they experienced a headache at some point. Dr. Claire Steves, a scientist involved with the study, said: The most reported symptoms of Omicron are really very much like a cold, especially in people whoaposve been vaccinated.  The full list is as follows:Runny nose -%. Headache - % Fatigue - % Sneezing - % Sore throat - % Persistent cough - % Hoarse voice - % Chills or shivers - % Fever - % Dizziness - % Brain fog - % Muscle pains - % Loss of smell - % Chest pain - %.The list does not distinguish between the vaccinated or unvaccinated. Why have we not seen an end to restrictions   Omicron has proven to be slightly dferent to the previous iant of concern. Now the dominant iation in the UK since December, its apparently high levels of transmissibility have seen it sweep across the UK and cause record numbers of people infected. Vaccines and the mutation being less severe than others, according to scientists, means that deaths and hospitalisations have not reached the same levels of the height of the pandemic in .  Despite this, staff shortages and high case numbers can put key services under strain and restrictions are put in place to stop them from becoming overwhelmed.Plan B restrictions are due to expire on January , but a report by The Times says that face masks could stay, while vaccine passports are expected to be axed along with work-from-home guidance. A date for the announcement by the Prime Minister Boris Johnson has not yet been set.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSCoronavirusOmicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In photos and video footage, the cow can be seen with a third eye on its forehead, as well as four nostrils. Neeraj said: ”As soon as the cow gave birth, we thought it is some kind of a wound on his forehead before finding it as an eye with the help of a flashlight.  We then found four nostrils which further saw the locals thronging our home after the nocturnal birth. “The calf is moving normally and drinks milk from the motheraposs udder and makes good use of the third eye on his forehead. Itaposs more like God has visited us.” The Indian calf weighs around lbs and has a longer tongue than the average calf but is still managing to drink milk normally.  Locals believe the birth of the animal will bring villagers good luck and prosperity, with many showering the animal with gts such as coconuts and flowers. This is not the first calf with multiple eyes to be born. In May , a three-eyed calf arrived in Brynmawr, North Wales, where it was later slaughtered. Although the Indian calf is not destined for slaughter, its future is still uncertain, as one livestock department official believes the animal will not survive for long. They said: “These are rare cases but such mutant animals do not survive for a longer period.They either live for  months or they can die in a couple of weeks.” Neeraj has reached out to a local vet for a medical screening who confirmed that despite its unusual mutations, the three-eyed calf is currently healthy. The farmer also confirmed that the other calves that his cow has given birth to previously are in good health. He added: Before this delivery, she had given birth to two [calves]. They were healthy and without any mutation. As for the unusual appearance, a doctor has confirmed the cow’s extra features are purely down to science. Private practitioner, Madan Anand, said: The birth of a calf is just another case of deformity. It has nothing to do with the superstitions or even faith. “People should be made aware, especially those who are from rural areas who tend to worship such animals.  The local veterinarians in their respective domains such held awareness campaigns to avoid such practices.” Despite many seeing the calf’s rare appearance as a ine miracle, the vet maintained that the cause for the deformity is a hormonal disorder. The response from people in the immediate area suggested the calf was hugely important. It still struggled to stay upright as other calves do when they have just been born. But the reaction from the crowds which gathered suggested it had great signicance.

Kacey Wheeler recently had a washing machine delivered from the electrical retailer and claims the delivery man couldnapost stop staring at her when doing the drop off in Bradford last week. The -year-old even called her fiance Ryan Sager shortly afterwards to joke the man, known only as Jordan, was in love with her, but they were both gobsmacked when he texted her  minutes later. What Jordan didnapost know, however, was that the mobile number on the order sheet actually belonged to Ryan - as the washing machine had been a gt from his parents. As soon as I opened the door I saw one of the guys just didnapost take his eyes off me. I didnapost take it in a weird way at first and I thought it was funny. He was just staring at me, Kacey said. The other guy just came in, dropped the washer and then left, but the other guy didnapost want to leave. He was lingering around telling me where to put it and opening draws. It was really creepy but at the time I just thought it was strange. I was winding Ryan up telling him the driver was in love with me, then I thought he was joking when he said heaposd got texts from him. I canapost believe he just took the number off the sheet and he knows where we live. Evenheaposd have come into my house and asked for my number it wouldnapost have been as weird.Not happy at the driveraposs advances, Ryan decided to embarrass Jordan by engaging in a flirty six-hour text exchange, which he later shared to Facebook.Posing as his six-months-pregnant fiancee, Ryan began chatting with Jordan who bragged about being a former prison bad boy and cheekily suggested they should meet up to get this washer sorted. In the six-hour chat Ryan, , even asked Jordan, who claimed to be chilling at Currys self-employed, to be his sugar daddy after he bragged about earning £, per year. Electrician Ryan believes he aposintimidatedapos the delivery worker with his late-night request of a threesome and description of naughty bedroom kinks - including a request he dress up as a Marvel superhero. When the Currys driver tried to continue the chat the next day, Ryan abruptly cut him off saying, f*** off now, Iaposm bored, before revealing Jordan had actually been talking to Kaceyaposs fiance for hours. Despite the light-hearted prank to waste Jordanaposs time, Ryan has been angered by the delivery manaposs cheek and Kacey now says sheaposs afraid to accept deliveries without her fiance in the house. Ryan said: Thereaposs my shoes in the house, Kaceyaposs six months pregnant and sheaposs got an engagement ring on. Itaposs just utter disrespect. When I got the phone call and the text came through I was annoyed, but then I thought Iaposd make a laugh out of it. I thought aposIaposm going to [pull] your legapos. My favourite bit was asking him to dress up in a Marvel costume and him replying that heaposs a prison boy. He was trying to big himself up. Itaposs embarrassing. He deserves to have the mick taken out of him. From the texts you can tell heaposs a very strange guy. I thought Iaposd scared him off on the night, talking about a threesome, but then when he messaged back the next day and I wasnapost having a good day at work so I just told him to f*** off. Iaposm happy heaposs wasted all that time. Every time I put something provocative, heaposd have been sitting there on his couch sweating, thinking aposwhat do I do with his girlapos. He thought heaposd pulled. If it was me Iaposd have felt tiny. I hope he feels like an idiot. If he came back to the house heaposd get it, but itaposs a shame for Kacey. You shouldnapost be made uncomfortable by delivery drivers like that. Currys said they were treating the matter aposvery seriouslyapos and confirmed they are currently investigating it.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

With so many artists out there, itaposs hard to know where to begin in the search for the right one. But one woman who entrusted her friend to do the ink was so horried by the final result that she was forced to get it fixed a week later.Jessica Williams shared the end product on her TikTok @jessicawilliams, where she said thank God for coverups.In a series of viral videos, Jessica explained: My friend and I tend to do a lot of things out of impulse because thataposs just how we are and it makes for great stories. After asking around for recommendations, the women were told about a mutual friend who tattoos at his house.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. This should have been red flag number one, she later realised. She explained: He showed us some of his work. His girl was there and she had her whole body covered in tattoos he did and they werenapost bad. He also tattooed himself and they werenapost bad. So she showed him a picture of what she wanted doing, a dainty design of two hands reaching out to each other. But unfortunately for Jessica, her Michelangeloaposs The Creation of Adam inspired piece ended up looking more like ET from the iconic phone home scene. She added: He put the stencil on, it looked great. It was what I wanted. But when I looked down when it was finished, that wasnapost the stencil... at all. The hands instead ended up looking more like claws thanks to the wobbly linework. Jessica later ended up going to a proper tattoo shop to get the ink fixed. She explained: The new tattoo artist told me that from the way it looked, the [mutual friend] pressed way too hard for it to be on my rib cage which was going to make it harder for him to cover up. So a week later, once the design has healed slightly, she went back to have it covered over with some flowers. Since being posted, the video has racked up more than , likes and , comments from people who were stunned by the final result. One person said: Iaposve never done a tattoo in my le but I genuinely think I can do better. Another wrote: Iaposve seen jail tats better than that. A third commented: YOUaposRE JOKING ! WERE THE ARTISTaposS EYES CLOSED  Someone  put: This is the first one thataposs made me audibly cackle. Itaposs giving ET phone home.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Waves reaching up to  metres hit the outer Haaposapia island group, destroying all of the houses on the island of Mango, as well as the west coast of Tongaaposs main island, Tongatapu, the prime ministeraposs office said. In Kanokupolu village on the island of Tongatapu locals have been pictured staring at trees that have been felled, buildings in ruins and everything coated in black ash. James Garvin, chief scientist at NASAaposs Goddard Space Flight Center, said the force of the eruption was estimated to be equivalent to five to  megatons of TNT, an explosive force more than  times the nuclear bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima, Japan, at the end of World War Two. The blast was heard as far away as Alaska and was probably one of the loudest events to occur on Earth in over a century, according to Michael Poland, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey.This might be the loudest eruption since [the eruption of the Indonesian volcano] Krakatau in , Poland told NPR. That massive th-century eruption killed thousands and released so much ash that it cast much of the region into darkness. Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haaposapai was completely destroyed by Saturdayaposs explosion, says Dan Slayback, a research scientist for NASAaposs Goddard, as well as Science Systems and Applications Inc. Slayback says the blast was so massive it even appears to have taken chunks out of the older islands nearby. They werenapost ash — they were solid rock, blown to bits, he says. It was quite amazing to see that happen.  With its airport smothered by volcanic ash and communications badly hampered by the severing of an undersea cable, information on the scale of the devastation has mostly come from reconnaissance aircraft. Planes sent from New Zealand show the damage from the air with images of the inundation caused by tsunami on the western coast of the main island of Tongatapu.  A dficult humanitarian aid effort is now under way to help the survivors from the disaster. The Red Cross said its teams in Tonga had confirmed that salt water from the tsunami and volcanic ash were polluting the drinking water relied on by tens of thousands of people. Securing access to safe drinking water is a critical immediate priority... as there is a mounting risk of diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea, Katie Greenwood, the Pacic head of delegation for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said in a statement.

The blizzard led to snowfalls more than ft deep which blocked doors and windows, reaching as high as the first floor in some areas. She was eventually found  hours after she initially went missing while ing from school. It took the search team  hours to find and rescue the youngster.  To keep herself alive, she was hugging a fluffy dog for warmth, according to local media. When found, Vika was lying with the stray mongrel on a mattress which animal-loving locals had put out for homeless pooches. It was lodged under a low balcony where they could shelter from the storm.  Local media initially reported she clambered into a kennel, which was later corrected. “She was taken straight to hospital, and found to have mild frostbite,” said a local source. She had left school at pm, and was found next morning at :am. Olesya Voznyuk, an official with the Investigative Committee, said: “She was hiding under a balcony with the dog. The girl loves animals very much, she used to play with local dogs all the time.“She went to feed these dogs after school and then got caught in the snow storm and strong winds.” The space under the balcony gave some shelter but it still took more than  people over  hours to find her from when her parents raised the alarm .  Her “relieved” mother Tatyana, , was reunited with Vika at hospital. The girl was allowed home the same day . Now there are plans to honour the dog that saved Vika -they can find it after the pooch went missing.

Mainland China aposs zero-tolerance policy is what led to the decision to cull the rodents, leaving animal lovers outraged.Authorities have ordered the hamsters to be put down humanely as well as putting a stop to imports and sales.Have your say on this situation in the comment section Multiple pet shops have been shut and disinfected as men in protective gear were seen cleaning the pet shop that is in the heart of the Causeway Bay district. Health Secretary Sophia Chan told a news conference authorities were acting out of caution even though there was no evidence domestic animals can infect humans. Meanwhile, the director for Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department has told people to avoid kissing their pets and to wash their hands after touching them.  Leung Siu-fai told reporters: Pet owners should keep a good hygiene practice, including washing hands after touching the animals, handling their food or other items, and avoid kissing the animals. Leung said the hamsters had to be put down because it would be impossible to quarantine and observe each one. He also said that anyone who bought hamsters after December should hand them over to be culled and not leave them on the streets.  A hotline for enquiries is being set up, while some of the  customers of the pet shop were going into quarantine, officials said. The animals were said to have been imported from the Netherlands, local broadcaster RTHK said. Authorities in Hong Kong have also been carrying out Covid tests on rabbits and chinchillas, but only hamsters have tested positive so far. The local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which runs veterinary clinics, said it was shocked at the decision.In a statement, the organisation said: The SPCA is shocked and concerned over the recent government announcement on the handling of over , small animals, which did not take animal welfare and the human-animal bond into consideration. Research head Jan Schmidt-Burbach said:Culling animals should always be a last resort and we encourage governments to explore other options, such as quarantine, first.  Throughout the pandemic, there have been reported Covid- cases in dogs and cats, but scientists say there is no evidence to say animals play a major role in human contagion. Nikolaus Osterrieder, dean of the Jockey Club College of Veterinary Medicine and Le Sciences at the City University of Hong Kong said: It is obviously a drastic measure but one that is a consequence of zero Covid . Hamsters are very susceptible to SARS-CoV- and can produce large amounts of virus. Hong Kong has triggered fresh restrictions after dozens of new Covid cases. Last year, three pet cats that tested positive for Covid were put down in the Chinese city of Harbin, sparking outrage on social media. In , Denmark culled millions of mink over a Covid- mutation.

The luxury yacht, whose price is confidential, could also be seen narrowly getting through river locks - where the slightest error could cost a fortune.Heesen spokeswoman Sara Gioanola said that it takes three or four months to plan a voyage due to the permits and certicates needed. We are used to taking our boats to the North Sea via canals and rivers - weaposve been doing so for the past + years, she said. After four years of construction, Heesenaposs -metre all-aluminium Project Cosmos, now known as MY Galactica, left her shed in Oss last Friday and began her maiden voyage through the Dutch canals and rivers in perfect weather conditions.No Heesen has ever been so celebrated when leaving our shipyard. Passing through the tight lock in Macharen on Saturday, with only  cm of clearance on each side, we had to wait for a calm day with no wind. Locks are not the only gateways we have to go through.  We must also pass under many bridges, where clearance is particularly tight. Beforehand, we perform physical measurements. These are paramount, especially now that the river waters are higher than usual. She added: Weaposve been doing so for the past + years. This is standard procedure with luxury yachts of this size when dealing with inland cruising. Waiting for the tide to fall is just aposbusiness as usualapos. Galactica passed Heusden with  cm clearance.  Arthur Brouwer, Heesen CEO, said: Building large and complex superyachts is exciting, both from an engineering and construction perspective. We are incredibly fortunate to have the best naval architects, engineers, and craftsmen in the country to build our yachts. In spite of all the challenges imposed by the pandemic.  We also managed to keep the construction of Project Cosmos, now known as MY Galactica, on schedule - which was no mean feat. Precision aluminium construction, high performance, and the finest Dutch craftsmanship are steeped into the DNA of this shipyard.

A team working for TV channel Sat. have handed the evidence to detectives probing Brueckner over the infamous case.British youngster Madeleine was just three-years-old when she vanished from her parents’ holiday apartment in Portugal in . German prosecutors claim to have evidence she is dead and named convicted paedophile Brueckner as their only suspect. Despite going public with the information in June , they have still not charged him with any offence. But now Sat. investigators claim to have found fresh evidence linking Brueckner, who denies any involvement, to the crime. They will reveal more information about their investigation in a prime-time documentary, which is yet to have an air date. Announcing the show, Sat. said journalist Jutta Rabe and a team of reporters gathered new information about Brueckner. They claim it includes proof he was near Praia da Luz when Madeleine vanished while her parents dined in a tapas restaurant. The channel said they collected “many new clues and indications” that corroborate the suspicions of German prosecutors. Editor-in-chief Juliane Ebling said: “The sad story of Madeleine McCann is a story that has many German facets. “The case is being tried at the Regional Court of Braunschweig, as the German Christian B. is the main suspect.  “In his environment there are many German women and men who can describe inidual details surrounding the crime. “Jutta Rabe has researched shocking material in Germany, Portugal and England over the past months, which heavily incriminates Christian B.” Sat. confirmed the show will be airing on German TV but said “no exact broadcast date has been set”. When contacted by the Mirror, chief public prosecutor Hans-Christian Wolters was unavailable for comment. His office confirmed in December that they soon hope to charge Brueckner with raping a woman in Portugal. He is suspected of attacking Irish waitress Hazel Behan in the Algarve three years before Madeleine vanished.  She waived her right to anonymity two years ago to come forward and accuse Brueckner of attacking her in . The German, , is already serving a jail term for raping a pensioner in Praia da Luz in . Mr Wolters said he is % convinced” Brueckner also killed Madeleine, who was just three when she vanished. The German was living in a camper van close to Praia da Luz when Madeleine disappeared. Police first became aware of him as a suspect in  but only went public with the information in June .

It’s important in cementing a local community together and stopping rural depopulation.“These are definitely exceptional circumstances.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files january 7 2022","story":"Machrihanish and Islay topped the highest gusts of wind recorded in the west of Scotland on Tuesday.Throughout the early

speed-related accidents.Argyll and Bute Council#s roads director Alistair Gow told councillors that use of both fixed and portable cameras to detect speeding had increased dramatically in the last few years.They had been pioneered by the former Strathclyde Regional Council which had paid for their purchase and installation with the police meeting the running costs.From the limited information available, an average drop of  per cent in injury accidents was being achieved where they were being used in the UK.#A substantial proportion of injury accidents within Argyll and Bute are speed related and in view of the above statistics, remote speed enforcement could substantially reduce the occurrence of accidents of this nature,# he said.#There are other types of equipment available which are not intended to operate as enforcement tools, but instead to convey a visual message to speeding motorists. This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet.

Instead, it is based on the evidence-based, historical fact of Jesus# resurrection: #[God] has given us … hope# – a Bible term for #certainty# – #through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.# Because Jesus is alive, bodily, physically and in real time and space raised from death, we can have certainty even in these uncertain times in which we live."},{"url":null,"title":"argyll ranked one of the most peaceful locations in britain","story":"With demand for rural retreats rising and more people looking to escape the typical tourist hotspots for a tranquil break, holiday provider Cottages in Northumberland carried out research to find the top places to find peace and quiet in England, Scotland and Wales.Thinking about what makes an area quiet – no people, no noise, no light pollution and lots of nature and wildle – Cottages in Northumberland pulled together data covering population count, National Park counts and Dark Sky sites.This data was then ranked to reveal the UK#s quietest areas as follows:  Powys, Wales  Northumberland, England  The Highlands, Scotland  Argyll and Bute, Scotland  Morayshire, Scotland  North Yorkshire, England  Pembrokeshire, Wales  Cumbria, England  Aberdeenshire, Scotland  Devon, England.Just missing out on a podium spot, Argyll and Bute ranked highly thanks to the area#s low population count of  people per square kilometre, which is actually the third lowest count in the UK overall, following the Scottish Highlands and Western Isles.Being home to Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park and the internationally recognised Isle of Coll Dark-Sky Community also helped boost Argyll and Bute#s position.The only Scottish location to rank higher was the Highlands which came third in the overall rankings.Having the lowest population count in the whole of the UK, with a mere nine people per square kilometre, helped to elevate the Highlands into the bronze position.It also home to the Cairngorms National Park which is a centre for outdoor activity, with mountains, lochs, woodland forests and rivers, as well as small local villages which are lovely to explore.And whilst the Highlands does not have an internationally recognised Dark Sky park, it does have  Milky Way sites, ranking it second in the UK for Dark Sky sites.In second place, Northumberland was deemed England#s quietest place.The coastal county, which houses Northumberland National Park, has a low population count of  people per square kilometre.It is also well known for its stargazing potential, boasting one Dark Sky Orion site and  Milky Way sites – more sites than anywhere  in the UK.And taking the top spot, Powys in Wales was officially crowned the best place for peace and quiet in Great Britain.With a population count of  people per square kilometre, and home to the Brecon Beacons National Park where there are endless woodlands, waterfalls, hills, moorlands, and heritage sites to explore, Powys is undoubtedly a place of peace and serenity."},{"url":null,"title":"minato-sushi-cheese-lady-boost-haddington-town-centre","story":"The Cheese Lady on Haddington High Street is moving into the former butcher premises of Colin D Peat on neighbouring Court Street.The move from High Street has opened the door for Minato Sushi to bring the Japanese delicacy to the town centre.The changing face of the town centre was welcomed by councillors Tom Trotter and John McMillan, with the new businesses set to open this summer.Jen Kerr, of Minato Sushi, stressed there was still plenty of work ahead at the business before the doors opened.The -year-old, of Port Seton, who will run the business with her boyfriend Tom Cuddy, described it as “a real dream come true”.She said: “We are really excited.

North Berwick Youth Project started an online cookery group to keep youngsters entertained and educated.Previously, a cooking class took place at the town’s Hope Rooms, which young people attended weekly to choose a dish, go to the shops to buy ingredients, cook the meal and eat it together.Recipes include nachos and truffles Once a month, a group of older people from the community would join the session for an intergenerational meet and eat.Now, the youth project carries out a class online, where one young person takes the role of head chef and demonstrates how to make their chosen dish – ingredients are delivered to the chef’s home by staff from the youth project, which received funding from Tesco Community Grants to do so.Beth Smith, lead youth worker, said: “Not only have the young people learned new recipes but they have also grown in confidence and fed their families.“We had been posting the dishes on Facebook and had quite a few comments from teachers at North Berwick High School and people in the community saying they’d love to see us create a recipe book.“We had previously tried to gather recipes and had the intention of creating the book before summer but we were extremely busy and never got round to chasing it up.”But last November, David and Judith Booth, of local firm Booth Creative, were contacted to assist the project after designing the youth group’s new

This is the Edinburgh Blue Balls, a men’s mental health swim group.Among those taking part in that pre-swim “check-in” is actor Johnny Panchaud who recalls his very first such circle, vividly, ashe were still there.“We’re all standing on the sand, all these men of dferent shapes, sizes, ages. We’re all nervous about swimming. And Marc, the founder of the group, just says, ‘We’re going to do a check-in today.’ Everyone was like, what the hell’s a check-in  Normally getting in the water is the scary part.“So we’re standing in a circle, and even that’s scary, men getting in a circle, and we start telling each other how we’re feeling and what we’re struggling with. And these words like anxiety, depression, fear, that people always experience but, especially, men never share, start coming out.”Edinburgh Blue Balls swimmer Johnny Panchaud,Marc MillarAlso in attendance at some of those early swim check-ins was keen rugby player John McMillan.“As we went round,” he says, “everyone was sharing their fears and anxieties and you could see that, as it progressed, people’s chests were getting bigger, almost getting strength from the group itself.“McMillan had found the group at a time of need, spotting it on Facebook in the run up to the fth anniversary of the day he tried to take his le.“Because I knew the anniversary was approaching,” he says, “things were building up. I knew either I was going to have a total breakdown or I needed to do something. Coming across this group was a huge weight off my shoulders. I was able to not bottle it up as much.”John McMillan,Marc MillarThe Instagram strapline for the Edinburgh Blue Balls is “weekly swim group to give men the chance to improve mental and physical health”.As the group has got bigger and the weather colder, they now no longer do a physical check-in before swimming and have replaced it with an online chat group. Issues discussed there include alcoholism, abusive relationships, attempted suicides, bereavement, depression, anxiety.Of course, long before men discovered group wild swimming and got the t-shirt , women were there.With my collaborator Anna Deacon, I’ve been writing books about wild swimming for some years now . At book events, people would sometimes ask us, why it was wild swimmers were mainly women  Why was it all blue tits and no blue balls But the pandemic has expanded the demographic coming to the water. With lockdowns and restrictions leaving many of us cooped up and isolated, more have been drawn to the great escape of getting into a cold sea.: The ice breakers. How Scotlands ice swimmers taught me to love the cold.The past couple of years have taken a toll on our collective mental health. Deaths from alcohol, in , were up almost  percent on the previous year and twice as many men as women died as a result of alcohol.Depression levels have doubled during the pandemic. It’s against this backdrop that an outdoor swimming for mental health trend has emerged.Particularly powerful has been the UK-wide Mental Health Swims movement founded by Rachel Ashe.Meanwhile, this new wave of men’s groups, swimming explicitly for mental health, has arrived with names like Edinburgh Blue Balls, the Sunrise Club, Blue Balls Cornwall, Ice Guys North East and Fe Dippers Mental Health Men’s Dip.It’s December  when I meet Marc Millar for a chat at Bross Bagels, which he runs with his partner in Portobello. The -year-old sports the same broad beard that lunges out of the logo created by a friend for the group’s social media. That graphic is also emblazoned across ious bits of entertaining group merchandise, including a hoodie, and their Edinburgh Blue Balls budgie smugglers. A set of blue balls, naturally, also feature in the entertainingly tongue-in-cheek image. Millar is himself a professional photographer, who has taken images accompanying this article.Edinburgh Blue Balls swimming at Wardie Bay,Anna DeaconHe describes how he had been following the Instagram account of Ice Guys North East, who swim from Roker Beach, Sunderland.When he askedthey might start a group in Edinburgh, their reply was to encourage him to set it up himself. “So I had a couple of bottles of wine one night and did it. Before I knew it ten people were coming the next day.”The group snowballed. “It’s a bunch of guys,” Marc says, “with absolutely nothing in common, all dferent ages, walks of le. Before a swim, everyone’s polite. But then you dip your balls in the water and you’ve got everything in common, everything. You feel so much empathy.”One of the main issues, he observes, for a lot of the members is anxiety. “Also abusive relationships. And a lot of the guys are open about how they’ve tried to commit suicide as well. ”What’s clear, from speaking to many other swimmers, is that Millar’s willingness to express his anxieties is part of its success. He’s not only leading them into the water, but into a particular way of talking about themselves.As Johnny Panchaud puts it, “He got everyone’s trust so quickly and I think that came through him being extremely transparent. For the first month he was saying, saying, ‘Guys I’m s***ing myself, I’m still terried before every single group.’ The leader of the group showing vulnerability has encouraged us to show vulnerability.”Edinburgh Blue Balls at Portobello beach,Marc MillarPanchaud shows his own vulnerability as he relates the journey that led him to being now -months sober.Back in October , he had hit a low, and whilst visiting his parent’s house when they were were away, he found himself alone with his own dark thoughts.“I’m not going to say that I was thinking about committing suicide, because I don’t think I would ever have had the bottle to see that through. But the thought had entered my mind for the first time: ‘How do I get out of this ”He called an old friend in London who flew up “at the drop of a hat” and after much soul-searching, he made a pledge to himself: he would stop drinking and taking recreational drugs. Five days later, he took up an offer from friends to go for a “wild water swim” at Portobello. In the run up he found himself genuinely losing sleep over the imminent dip.“But we did it. I must have been in and out in two minutes. But after that, I went religiously, every single day for one month.”In that early stage, he says, he was not “ready to look back at the trail of destruction I’d caused with my drinking and drugs”, or forward.“I felt I’ve got to find a way of staying sober today. And with wild swimming, you physically can’t think about anything other than now.”Amongst the group, he is not alone in his openness about dark times. David Nimmons, for instance, describes how prior to this he was driven to seek help from his doctor by his suicidal thoughts, and the attempted suicide of his brother.“My marriage had ended. I was trying to make sense of everything, including my brother’s attempted suicide. I had started speaking to a talking therapist through the NHS which helped massively but I needed something . I needed something to help me control it on my own terms.”A reason swimming appealed was, he says, because his brother had attempted suicide by jumping off rocks into a river.“For my brother, the idea was that this cold water was going to take him away. But for me the water gives me strength. No matter what day I’ve had, once I’m in the water with the guys it’s like le is beautul.”The circle,Anna DeaconIt’s hugely moving to hear these men’s stories, told with hearts on sleeves.Stuart Kennedy, for instance, describes the rollercoaster last few years of his le, in which his best friend died in a car accident, he split up with his we and began a long stint of living with parents and friends, during the pandemic and then, just as he had started to feel that le was getting back to normal, his ex-we was diagnosed with cervical cancer.That cancer, sadly, would take her le, and leave Kennedy supporting his two young sons through the loss of their mother.Then there’s Ryan Malone, who recalls,“Lockdown hit me pretty badly. But this has always been underlying. I’m . I’ve been speaking to a few people about why men in that age bracket are in such a bad state of mental health. For me, it was just a build up of anxiety and depression.“It built up to one Sunday in August, when my we was in London and I was on my own. I couldn’t breathe. I’d had anxiety and minor panic attacks before but with this I realised I needed to seek help. I went to the GP that Monday.”Ryan Malone,Marc MillarMalone mentions the mid-le crisis, which also something also broached by Mental Health Swims coach Salim Ahmed. The founder of SwimLab, Ahmed teaches swimming as an art, rather than competitive skill.Men are, he observes, becoming more aware that there are several stages to the ‘midle crisis’.“There’s the accelerated way in which your body starts to fail having to let go of your personal best and learning that you need to accept certain things are happening with your physiology.“Men are becoming aware of that. They’re starting to discover that just having a swim every couple of days is making them feel so much better. And then they find that they’re getting their mojo back. But they have to embrace the fact that they have to approach swimming in a dferent way. Not to win, but to live.”But is it even about swimming  It seems to me the male mental health swim trend is part of a wider men’s mental health movement that’s expressed in multiple ways.Marc Millar observes: “It’s not actually about swimming or dipping. It’s just a mutual thing where everyone is doing the same thing at the same time.”Edinburgh Blue Balls,Marc MillarIt’s January , . A large, woolly-hatted flock of around  men mill around the groyne that leads down to the water at Portobello beach and are are joined by visiting swimmers Jonathan Cowie, editor of Outdoor Swimmer magazine and, of all things, a woman, Gilly McArthur, sporting a fake beard.As the crowd moves towards the water, wading in what looks like some kind of communal baptism, there’s a flurry of grunts and out-breaths.But there are no signs of competition here – just what looks like pure, joyful swimming to live.Cowie and McArthur are here as part of a month of swims with men, their intention being “to expand out the message that cold water can be helpful and powerful for men as well as women.”:  Scottish wild swim spots with amazing communitiesEmerging from the water, McArthur, comments on how she felt a touch of intimidation going in with so many men. It’s the mirror to something Millar expresses.A resident of Portobello, he had watched groups of mainly women getting into the water there, and felt uncomfortable as a man with joining.“I never would see any guys.

It follows from that that the suggestion that it was a form of retaliation for her ‘blowing the whistle’, as she put it, cannot be right.”Ms Fitzpatrick was also dismissed for falsying emails about the incident and the tribunal found that these were likely “not genuine”.However, while the judge found in favour of Marine Scotland, he also fired a warning shot to the body over the “kindergarten” culture within its Scrabster office and its handling of the whole affair.The judgment states: “The claimant had the perception that she had been the victim of a bullying culture for a very long period. Whilst we have made the findings that we have, not all that she said in evidence was, we considered, unreliable or untrue.“Some of the behaviours at the office were entirely wrong. It was not a kindergarten, but a government office charged with enforcing the law. It was, at least for a material period, dysal, given the evidence of how those working there conducted themselves, and not all steps that were recommended to be taken to remedy that were.”The tribunal heard that while Ms Fitzpatrick had ious opportunities to raise the chair incident with managers or HR professionals, the first time she did so was “fleetingly” when she was facing another unrelated disciplinary in .It was not mentioned again until she raised an employment tribunal in , alleging harassment.While it was not part of her original claim in that case, she mentioned the incident while giving evidence and it received widespread media attention, with the image later being published widely in the press and on social media.This prompted a backlash against the men involved – Reid Anderson and Jody Paske – which Judge Kemp said was “so dreadful” some of it amounted to criminal conduct.Marine Scotland said Ms Fitzpatrick’s lies caused that abuse, as well as a subsequent police investigation into the men which resulted in Police Scotland taking no further action.The tribunal heard that Mr Anderson’s we even wrote to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to tell of the “living hell” they had been suffering and claiming that Ms Fitzpatrick had been harassing and bullying them, including via an online petition.Ms Fitzpatrick is also said to have upset other co-workers by making “derogatory and offensive” statements about them online, while she also wrote to Ms Sturgeon and said being asked to meet with a manager to discuss the chair incident was like “having to sit with a rapist while he gets away with the crime”.She was ultimately dismissed for lying about the timing and the nature of the incident after a digital forensic expert said it was beyond doubt that the photo was taken in August .Lying on oath at the previous tribunal and providing  details to the media also formed part of her disciplinary.Judge Kemp also rejected her claims for breach of contract and whistleblowing."},{"url":null,"title":"jim-goodwin-explains-jamie-mcgrath-st-mirren-absence-transfer-speculation-messing-head","story":"The Buddies attacking midfielder has been linked with a move to the English Championship with his contract due to expire in the summer.

However, when ministers then assert that ferry replacement costs must be met by Orkney Islands Council, but not by their counterparts on the west coast, it simply runs salt in the wounds.#Indeed, during the same question time, the transport minister boasted about a £m Scottish Government investment in port infrastructure serving one west coast route, even though it falls under the responsibility of the local council. That being the case, there is no reason why similar investment cannot be made in vessel replacement on Orkney’s leline internal ferry routes.#I welcome confirmation that discussions are ongoing between the Finance Secretary and OIC.

He has got a good training week with us next week and we will know whether he is right to play. We will just have to wait and see how he goes over the next couple of weeks.New year means new #GuinnessSixNations! #Welcome #HappyNewYear pic PnnynesSF— Guinness Six NationsJanuary , “He’s the best person to captain the team. Very clearly, he’s the best person in my judgement to captain the team.“If he’s fit and eligible for selection, he will captain the team. If he’s not then we will make an adjustment to that.”When asked why Farrell was picked when Underhill and Daly were overlooked, Jones replied: “Every player is treated dferently – that’s the rationale.“We just make a judgement on each player. Selection comes down to a judgement.” vw,vw,px, px\"Jack Nowell has been in blockbusting form for Exeter The number of  World Cup finalists culled from England’s squad as Jones continues his team rebuilding now stands at five with Ford, Daly and Underhill joined by the Vunipola brothers in being frozen out.Manu Tuilagi will be managed carefully as he closes in on a comeback from the hamstring torn against South Africa in the autumn and Jones declined to give any assurances that he would be involved in the Six Nations.But Jack Nowell could be in line to make his first appearance since Japan  after overcoming a dreadful series of injuries, in the process giving up alcohol and over a stone in weight to enhance longevity.“Jack definitely looks more like a rugby player and less like a bodybuilder. As you get older, you have to train dferently,” Jones said.VOTE TIME: Who was your @Bradfords_Build @ExeterChiefs Player of the Day in our @ChampionsCup victory over @glasgowwarriors Jack Nowell Sam Simmonds Tom OFlaherty#EXEvGLA pic vyxPguOnp— Exeter ChiefsJanuary , “For our experienced players, that’s the challenge they have had. Sometimes habits of young players don’t suit you as you get older and I think Jack has made a really good adjustment. He’s got the bounce back in his step.“Watching him play on Saturday night for Exeter against Glasgow, he was bouncing out of tackles, he had huge workrate, huge appetite for the ball. That’s the sort of player we remember.“We have not really seen him since . It has been a long time between drinks!

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year. While onboard, Mavis learned to operate every part of the ship, from hoisting and lowering the sails to scrubbing the decks – even learning how to helm and steer the ship.  Brave Mavis also grabbed the chance to climb the ship’s rigging – a height of around .m from the deck.The Jubilee Sailing Trust promotes a unique mission, to give people of mixed abilities and circumstances the freedom to explore their ability, potential and place in the world through inclusive adventures at sea.Alongwith her team – called a “Watch” – Mavis was also in charge of lookout for other vessels or shipping equipment which may affect the course of the ship.There were four Watches over a  hour period, each getting a chance to experience le onboard a tall ship. Watches are made up of people with mixed abilities, mostly first-timers like Mavis, but also those living with a disability.Mavis said: “I went on a voyage on Tenacious and it changed my whole outlook on le. It was the adventure of a letime. I was made to fee part of the team, sailing this magnicent ship, straight away, the permanent crew at our sides – and we couldn’t have done it without them. They guided us in all aspects of the running of the ship with care and kindness.“Watching everyone working together as a team really moved me. I wanted to let everyone know, whether disabled or non-disabled,you’ve lost confidence in le or fearful of being with people, this is where you need to be. Part of the team on Tenacious. She was built especially for this purpose to give new le and to find out just how able you really are.“I#ll never forget my voyage and the wonderful friends I made and so overwhelmed at how challenges were overcome. Thank you Tenacious and thank you to the magnicent permanent crew who led and guided us all the way.”Patrick Fleming, JST’s chief executive, said: “Tenacious is the only tall ship designed to be sailed by a mixed ability crew – allowing fellow voyage crew members to join in with the day-to-day activities on board.“It’s great to hear stories from people like Mavis who’s lives have been truly touched by the experiences offered onboard.”The JST charity offers people of all abilities the opportunity to climb aboard their tall ship Tenacious for an immersive sailing experience and relies on funding from the public.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia.

When handing down the sentence Mr Justice Tony Hunt at the SCC described Harte as the ringleader and the person who had inflicted most of the injuries on Mr Lunney.Two other men involved in the businessman#s kidnapping and assault, Alan O#Brien , of Shelmalier Road, and Darren Redmond , from Caledon Road, both East Wall, Dublin, were also given y prison sentences by the SCC.The anonymity order, which had initially been granted by the SCC, had been extended by the High Court in December.The order had been put in place when Harte, with an address at Island Quay Apartments, East Wall, was first before the courts in connection with the offences.It was granted because he had been due to go on trial before the Central Criminal Court in relation to an unrelated charge of murder.That trial collapsed and the charge against Harte was dismissed, after the DPP entered a nolle prosequi in the case.However, the order was continued, on a temporary basis after his conviction by SCC.This was done to protect the man#s rights to a fair trial as he has other unrelated criminal matters pending before the criminal courts.Following his conviction, Harte#s lawyers claimed that his naming by the media in reports could prejudice his rights to a fair trial before a judge and jury.Arising out of those concerns Harte launched High Court judicial review proceedings against the DPP and the SCC seeking orders including a temporary order extending his anonymity.The anonymity order was continued until Tuesday#s sitting of the High Court.On Tuesday Harte#s lawyers had asked the court to continue the order, arguing that there was a possibility that some of the criminal matters may be heard within the six month period.He sought an extension until February when one of the cases against him was due to be mentioned before the courts.Michael Hourigan BL for Harte said that there was a prospect that some of the criminal matters could be heard within the next six months.It was argued that a fade factor of about six months, between the time a person is sentenced to when they go before a judge and jury in other courts, was required.The application to further continue the order was opposed by the DPP, represented by Sean Guerin SC.Counsel said that there was little or no chance of the pending matters being heard within the next six months.There was therefore no reason why the man should not now be named counsel said.What was a spurious unfounded and articial arrangement should now be removed, he said.Counsel said that the continuation of the order was being sought as part of an attempt by Harte to continue to prevent his name from being published for quite some time.In his ruling, Mr Justice Meenan said that it was part of the criminal process that those convicted of offences be named, bar in certain exceptional circumstances.Harte#s case did not come under one of those exceptions, and the judge said that there was no reason to continue the order.He said that Harte could make any application he needs to the courts to have safeguards put in place to prevent him suffering any prejudice in any forthcoming trial.Related topicsKevin LunneyMore On Kevin Lunney PremiumLunney firm fears TV show about Sean Quinn could escalate campaign against them PremiumNet closing on the paymasters behind Kevin Lunney kidnap terrorKevin Lunney’s torturers get  years jail time PremiumKevin Lunney: ‘I don’t know why they did it...

It would have cost just £m to make up the shortfall for the rest of the financial year, but we were told this was not possible,” he said.“People across the North are currently engulfed in a cost of living crisis. We have seen a failure to support people dealing with massive energy bills, experiencing food poverty, welfare claimants and those on social housing waiting lists. During the peak of our pandemic minimal support was offered and took an age to be issued.“People were crying out for self-isolation support and mitigation payments. There was no proposal to bring forward proper mortgage payment support. This money could have done a lot of good and I cannot fathom why it was surrendered at a time of so much need and so little delivery from Minister Hargey.”DfC has been contacted for comment.The news comes after the Belfastrevealed that the Department of Justice handed back more than £m to DoF since the beginning of the last financial year.DoJ figures show that, over the course of the   financial year, £m in non ring-fenced resource expenditure  was handed back to DoF, while just over £m in capital expenditure was ed over the same period.Up to the end of December of this financial year £.m in non ring-fenced resource expenditure and £.m in capital spending was ed to the DoF.Related topicsDeirdre HargeyDepartment for CommunitiesDepartment of Finance Andy AllenMark H.

Only , physical checks had to be carried out on lorries.Mr Leheny explained physical checks, which can last for several hours, are a “last resort”the documentary or identity paperwork is not up to scratch.He added that the number of consignment checks would have created a lot more admin work for DAERA officials, hauliers and traders.“A physical inspection is a last resort so it’s natural that would be as low as it is becausethe documentation doesn#t give DAERA the information they need well then they have to open up the doors,” said Mr Leheny.“They would say it’s potentially an unknown load so we have to physically open up the trailer and see what’s in it.”The DUP’s Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson felt the figures should act as a “sobering statistic” for those who think the protocol is necessary. Behind those figures is a story of additional costs, delays, disrupted supply chains and products which had to be disposed of because checks meant goods got ruined,” he said.DUP MLA Diane Dodds added that % of all EU checks take place between GB and Northern Ireland and the figures highlight “the scale of the Irish Sea border imposed by the protocol”.“It is % more expensive to transport goods into Northern Ireland now because of the protocol#s paperwork costs,” she continued. “The Government has a responsibility to take action and we need to see a timetable for progress quickly set out.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the “best way” to reduce checks at ports is for the UK Government to agree to an EU proposal for a Swiss-style veterinary agreement, which would remove almost all physical SPS checks.“We have been making this proposal for months because we know that it will reduce checks and controls by %,” said the Foyle MP.Alliance MP Stephen Farry said the SPS checks are a product of Brexit, and “in particular the decision” of the UK Government to opt for a hard Brexit.“An SPS agreement is necessary to reduce the current checks and those that would be otherwise requiredthe grace period ends without a permanent solution,” he stated.A spokesperson for DAERA said under the terms of the protocol, Northern Ireland is required to apply SPS checks on eligible goods entering the EU zone from GB, in line with those checks prescribed for Third Countries.

However, no progress has been made.A petition calling on the council to take action and restore Wilmont House to its former glory has been signed by more than  people so far.It was launched by local woman Sharon Marks, who said she had noticed the poor state of the building while taking walks in Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park during lockdown.“About a year ago, I contacted the council to see what the plans for the building were as it was gted to the council and the people of Belfast,” she added.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “For such a beautul building to fall into such a state of disrepair is just so sad. “The council said it was planning on carrying out an expression-of-interest exercise in early  to find someone to bring it back into use, but the pandemic has delayed this. “That really hacked me off, so I got in contact with local politicians to bring things forward, but that didn’t get very far.“One or two people in the council shouldn’t be gatekeepers of Wilmont House. “It was gted to the council and all the people of Belfast. People should be able to enjoy it.“It is such a beautul building and for that amount of heritage and history to be lost would be terrible.”Donal Lyons, a member of Belfast City Council’s growth and regeneration committee, agreed action should be taken.“There’s not many buildings like Wilmont House left in Belfast, let alone ones in such a setting, and we need to ensure that they are protected for future generations,” he said. “We’re lucky to have them. Each one of them captures a moment in the city’s history and everyone has their own personal stories in which these beautul buildings play a role. “We need to do more than just let them sit in decay.”A spokesperson for the council said: “Wilmont House at Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park is a Grade B-plus listed building owned by Belfast City Council. “We are in the process of preparing an invitation for expressions of interest to go to the market later this year, seeking a suitably qualied developer to restore the building and bring it into a new use.”Wilmont House, which dates back to , served as the headquarters of the US Army in Northern Ireland during the Second World War. It was later used as a nursing home and a parks office for the council.

Whenever you’re coming up the ninth tee and get to the top of the fairway, you see the mountains, hotel and clubhouse, the views are just incredible.“You get a lot of great golf courses but they just don’t have the spectacular views which Newcastle does, with the mountains in the background.”Mr Thornton has played all over the world and said there is no course quite like it and it is one of the most dficult to play.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Announcing the winner, Today’s Golfer said it is not Photoshop wizardry, Royal County Down really is aesthetically perfect. The second reason for awarding it the top spot was because it is a relentlessly probing challenge of all aspects of the game.The publication said: “It is indubitably an awesome test, one which in inclement weather could verge toward being too dficult for high handicappers. That is the sum total of any criticism you could level at the course we believe is the finest in the world. Royal County Down is, by any stretch of the imagination, not especially forgiving. Carries of up to  yards are sometimes required and while the fairways are often wide, gorse and rough mean waywardness is punished.“Drive bunkers add to the premium on direction, and their pleasingly unkempt nature — with overhanging lips of marram, fescue and heather – adds additional penalty.“Domed greens dismiss approach shots lacking accuracy and recovery shots around them are perilous, for the slick slopes take mishit chipsaway from the pin and indeed potentially off the green entirely.”It added: “Mistakes are punished here... and are compoundednot accepted. Fortune doesn’t often favour the brave at RCD. But while visitors must be prepared for a robust examination of all parts of their game, this Northern Ireland links never feels tricked-up or unfair — unless you dislike blind shots, because there are plenty of them here.“RCD does not need the help of the weather to be testing or to get its full experience. It is epic in any conditions and on a relatively benign evening it is utterly heavenly still sufficiently challenging, but also offering the chance to savour a location and landscape whose majesty is conveyed accurately in the images you see of it here and where.“On the opening trio, Dundrum Bay edges their right side and a better start in Britain and Ireland you will not find. Then you turn round for the seminal short th and the rest of the front nine.“It is, without fear of contradiction, a breathtaking arena and, in our opinion, the finest course in the world you can play.”Related topicsDown RoyalMore On Down RoyalSam Ewing: Ballyclare teenager bags first win at Down Royal on School LaneMetcollect get behind Down Royal#s #action-packed’ Boxing Day racecardBryony Frost and Rachael Blackmore the leading lights on Down Royal ladies’ dayGordon Elliott delighted as Zanahiyr helps him rack up a welcome hat-trick at Down RoyalMinella Indo can show he hasn’t lost his golden touch at Down RoyalMost ReadWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days Joe McCarron: Man released from Donegal hospital by anti-vaccine campaigners to be buried todayAshling Murphy funeral: Mourners told young teacher ‘epitomised the beauty of le’East Belfast restaurant complains of ‘anti social behaviour’ following multiple cases of smashed windows‘Special’ Royal County Down voted world’s best golf courseTop VideosPlayLarge crowds gather for Ashling Murphy funeralBrian Smith appeared at Newtonards court on Tuesday.A north Belfast was todayconvicted of threatening to kill loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson.Following a brief contest at Newtownards Magistrates Court, -year-old Brian Smith was also convicted of harassing Mr Bryson and making a threat that he would petrol bomb the homes of the victims mother and partner, all committed between July -

Strangford Lough is a vital stopping off point as thousands comes to feed on its shores at low tide. Itrsquos an annual audio and visual spectacle that wildfowl expert Kerry Mackie never misses.As the woodlands burst into colour, songwriter Brigid OrsquoNeill draws inspiration before performing a secret gig at a small converted church on the shores of the lough.On a farm to the south tip of the lough, RSPB ranger Mark McCormick looks for endangered species like the yellowhammer. He explains how his work has helped him overcome PTSD which he suffered after witnessing a terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge in London.Around boats are being removed from the water and repaired, in Portaferry former ferry captain -year-old John Murray is getting his boat, the St Brendan, on to the quay for the winter, with the help of four generations of the Murray family.In the second episode, as winter approaches Hugh Thurgate is moving livestock between islands and Katy Bell from Ulster Wildle checks barn owl boxes at Mount Stewart. Bad weather is coming and preparations need to be made.As winter storms howl, Kenny Smyth makes sure the boats in his boatyard are secure, before retreating to his shed to work on Laragh, his beautul wooden River yacht. Working on the boat reminds Kenny of his father who established the yard after the war.Rough winter weather also gives Heidi McIlvenny a chance to search for shark egg cases, known by some as mermaidsrsquo purses. Strangford Lough provides habitat for sharks and rays and Heidirsquos work provides important research.At her farm near Greyabbey Kerry Angus looks forward to lambing and reflects how the care she provides for her flock is consistent with providing meat for the farm shop. Close by, Kerry Mackie is setting up traps for tagging oyster catchers.At Port Loughan farm, Katy is installing barn owl nesting boxes before the spring nesting season. Itrsquos been a long winter, but installing the boxes is a real sign that spring is on its way.In the third episode spring has sprung and there is new wildle arriving at the lough. As boat owners prepare for summer, Kieron Black says an emotional goodbye to Pavane, the boat owned by his late father, Brian Black, the environmental broadcaster and journalist who died in a tragic accident in Strangford harbour in .The fourth and final episode is set in summer, a busy season as humans and birds flock to the lough to enjoy its un-spoilt beauty and unique habitats.At Slievemoyle farm Mark McCormick from the RSPB is camping out for a dawn chorus survey. He is hoping he will hear the distinctive call of the endangered yellowhammer.Summers on Strangford lough mean long evenings stretching into glorious sunsets. In Portaferry four generations of the Murray family take the St Brendan out for an evening of fishing.Summer is regatta season on the Lough and a big moment for Kenny Smyth and his River class yacht. Itrsquos  years since the Rivers were built, and Kenny is hoping to wrestle a race trophy from his brother, Graham.Away from the buzz of summer activities, Katy Bell is hoping to find healthy barn owl chicks. Wet and extremely hot weather has meant most of the sites have failed this year, but a new site may have some healthy chicks.Out on the lough Kerry Mackie is counting greylag geese. Itrsquos important to monitor the populations as they can cause problems for farmers. Carrying out the counts reminds him of his deep family connections to the lough and a letime of memories.Kieron Black is also out snorkelling, remembering his father Brian. He would always try to fill everyday with experiences, something Kieron also tries to do, as he loses himself in the otherworldly surroundings of the loughrsquos seabed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_Celtic.jpg","title":"Celtic Bhoys kick off new year with win  ","story":"CELTIC Bhoys kicked off the new calendar year by picking up all three points away to long time league rivals Newcastle Swts at a soaking wet Donard Park on Saturday afternoon.An early Shaun Megahey penalty gave The Hoops a lead they would never relinquish before captain Michael Rice and marksman Jay Gibney ensured there would be no late rally from the Seasiders.Newcastle will count themselves unlucky to concede a penalty kick just five minutes in for a handball that they disputed actually came off a green and white jersey.Nonetheless, Celticrsquos ever reliable defender, Shaun Megahey, made no mistake with the spot kick and sent goalkeeper Fintan Canavan the wrong way to open the scoring.The Hoops kept their foot on the pedal with striker Jay Gibney testing Canavan from range. Newcastle did not make things easy for the visitors and constantly remained a threat in attack with the experienced Neil Corr causing problems all afternoon.Celticrsquos Conaill Kerr had his headed goal chalked off after he was adjudged to have fouled custodian Canavan by referee Peter Kelly.Kerr was determined not to be deterred by this and went on a surging run in the next passage of play, dancing around the Newcastle defence to unleash a shot that just whisked wide of the post.This seemed to wake up the Seasiders, who forced Celtic to retreat into their own half largely in thanks to the midfield display of Peter Brannigan.Newcastle nearly had their momentum derailed when lsquokeeper Canavan misplaced a pass to the feet of Gibney, although the Celtic strikerrsquos snapshot landed safely back into the arms of the grateful number one.As the hosts went back on the attack, Richard McInerney combined well with Shane Kearney before the Newcastle number rsquos inviting cross into the box was punched to safety by Celtic lsquokeeper Nathan Curran.The following ten minutes of play consisted of both teams battling for possession in the middle of the park, where man of the match Corey McCartan was notably winning the lionrsquos share for his Celtic side.The Hoops almost doubled their lead when Jordan McCoubrey fired a cross into the Newcastle box where team-mate Gibney managed to poke his head in front of Canavan to round the lsquokeeper.However, with the angle at goal not in his favour, the Celtic number nine saw his effort sail across the line and eventually out for a throw-in. This signalled the last notable passage of play before the half-time interval.Celtic began the restart positively with the ball quickly making its way back to lsquokeeper Curran, who sent a cross field pass to the feet of Stephen Galbraith.The Hoopsrsquo midfielder played a cute first time pass to Gibney, who sumptuously back-heeled to team-mate McCoubrey for a shot on goal that resulted in a corner.Newcastle decided to fight fire with fire and went on the attack. In what was possibly another sign that it wasnrsquot to be their day, the hosts had appeals for a penalty waved off after Brannigan was met with a tackle that sent him to the floor inside the box.The Seasiders enjoyed a purple patch where they hit the visitors with wave after wave of attacks, although they couldnrsquot find the vital touch to put the ball in the net.Celtic lsquokeeper Curran was forced to clear his lines on multiple occasions, and to his credit, The Hoopsrsquo number one remained sharp and focused throughout the  minutes.Peter OrsquoHare and skipper Louis Brunsdon were pulling the strings for Newcastle, but their final ball was just off the mark in what was becoming an increasingly frustrating afternoon for the home side.As the playing conditions began to become increasingly worse, there was a bright light in Celtic youngster Eoin Kelly, who made an impactful appearance off the bench and slowly began to swing the momentum in favour of his side ndash largely also in thanks to team-mate McCartan overturning possession in midfield.Another Celtic substitute, Sean McMahon, forced Newcastle lsquokeeper Canavan to produce the save of the match after his left footed effort was erted outside the post by a spectacular acrobatic e.The resultant corner was met with a similarly impressive save from Canavan, who stopped a point blank flick on header from Kelly.Newcastlersquos purple patch had well and truly ended and this was signied further when Celtic doubled their lead through skipper Michael Rice.After a long ball into the box looped over the Seasidersrsquo defence, the ball rolled invitingly out for Rice to toe poke beyond the impressive Canavan with  minutes left on the clock.The home outfit were not one to give up and went in search of the goal that would set up a nervous last few moments for their opponents.Corr almost awarded his side this opportunity when the ball landed at the veteranrsquos feet with only Curran to beat.However, the stubborn Celtic custodian refused to be bettered and spread his six foot frame as wide as he could to narrow the target and deny the certain goal.Moments later, Celticrsquos Peter Casey was clattered in the middle of the park but referee Kelly waved on the advantage which turned out to be an important call.Megahey gathered the loose ball on the right hand side of the pitch, before squaring a pass to Gibney, who struck a curling effort into the top right corner of the net to round off the scoring.Resilient to the end, Newcastle launched one last attack in search of a consolation goal.Despite the ball hitting the Celtic post in the midst of a goalmouth scramble, Newcastle captain Brunsdon couldnrsquot supply the required rebound and the referee blew his whistle for the final time.After the contest, man of the match Corey McCartan gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance and winning start to the year.ldquoAll of the boys worked hard, especially coming back from a few weeks off after Christmas, he said.ldquoIt was a hard game and everyone was still stf, so I think it was physically tough for both teams and the weather definitely didnrsquot help.ldquoNewcastle surprised me because of how sharp they were and how high of a level their fitness was, but we got the job done and are now focused on the next game.Newcastle: F Canavan, C Scott, S Kelly, D Allister, J Maginn, P Brannigan, P OrsquoHare, L Brunsdon , R McInerney, N Corr, S Kearney.Subs: D Rooney, C McMahon, C Morrison.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, B Connolly, M Rice , C McCartan, S Galbraith, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: R Fitzpatrick, E Kelly, S McMahon.Referee: Peter Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/12_January2022_IrishStreet.jpg","title":"Downpatrick regeneration ‘offers some light’ for year  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has warned that  could be a dficult year for the economy.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran says he fears there could be job losses in the retail sector and has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it can to provide support.He said the council should consult with the business community and also consider some form of rate relief.He said the economic situation had been exacerbated by the pandemic and urged the public to adhere to Covid regulations.ldquoThe virus has no respect for age or gender.

They are drawn from our century-and-half of operational work, and the lived experiences of those we work with today.We believe adopting these priorities will help to ensure people in crisis get the support they need no matter who or where they are.They are not only achievable, they are essential, and we urge all parties and candidates to incorporate them into their planning for the year ahead and beyond.A world where everyone gets the help they need in a crisis is within our reach onlywe choose it to be.l Sharon Sinclair is area director for British Red Cross, Northern IrelandThe publication British Red Cross Policy Priorities for the next Northern Ireland Executive is available on our website at: www.redcross.org.uk about-us what-we-do we-speak-up-for-change british-red-cross-policy-priorities-for-the-next-northern-ireland-executiveMore from the News Letter:Click here – VIDEO: Huge revamp of Belfast would create miles-long leafy avenue... turn Westlink into tunnel... and make city ‘blue again’ Click here – Wall of silence: Home Office suggests it is dangerous to tell public details about turning Carrickfergus hotel into base for foreign nationals Click here – Criminalising conversion therapy: Northern Ireland must avoid – not mimic – Canada’s new law says transgender writerA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

So it is an important element of our city le.”He added: “I know we have had some dficulties in the past with the Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations, but there is evidence that more groups are looking to become involved in this event. I know that further development work is necessary, and in fact is being planned and funded, and I welcome that.”   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It was a part of the annual events: the Rugby Schools Cup final was on Saint Patrick’s Day, some of the Irish regiments recognised it, indeed the Orange Order at one time recognised Saint Patrick’s Day.“So it is something I think we need to recover, and we need to encourage full participation in the Saint Patrick’s Day celebration. These developments in the council’s Cultural Strategy do provide for more outreach work, and for more development work. They provide for more longer term planning, and they will reap rich rewards, and create a truly inclusive celebration from which the city can benefit.”The council’s ten-year cultural strategy, “A City Imagining” outlines a new approach in delivering St. Patrick’s Day events from  onwards with a three-stage process being used to assess applications to deliver pilot projects this year.A council report recommends the commissioning of Beat Carnival and The Duncairn, to deliver pilot projects in March  with funding of £, and £, respectively. Féile an Phobail and the event management company MayWe will also be involved.In December Councillor Kyle resigned from the PUP claiming “dfering approaches” with the party on how to face the Northern Ireland Protocol element of the Brexit trade agreement.He faced criticism within the party after appearing on BBC’s The View programme in November, in which he highlighted potential benefits of the Protocolit was altered.Councillor Kyle himself said in a resignation statement “My own view, shared by many other unionists, is that we need a twin track approach that seeks fundamental reform of the Protocol while looking to exploit opportunities created by Northern Ireland’s unique position”.The PUP said his comments were “not the position of the party” and stressed that the Northern Ireland Protocol “must go”. Billy Hutchinson is the only remaining PUP representative in Belfast council.John Kyle has been a Belfast councillor since  when he was co-opted following the death of former party leader David Ervine.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThey set off along Highwalls Road in dry humid conditions to the Dinas Powys golf course, where a number of golfers were out enjoying the peace and quiet of the early morning before a short climb led them to the One o’Clock gate. Here the leader paused to explain that small leaved lime trees can be found in the adjacent wood, which denotes ancient woodland and also that this particular species of tree has never been found further southwest than Monmouth.Entering Park Wood the path between bare trees and over fallen autumnal leaves led them slightly uphill beside Beauville Wood for a circumnavigation of the pretty woodland to a site overlooking Michaelston. Once a pathway on the north eastern side of the wood led up to a summerhouse belonging to Cwrt yr Ala from where they would have enjoyed lovely views over their vast estate land.Exiting through a gateway there was a chance to examine a piece of rock containing crinoids which are marine animals and ancient fossils that predate dinosaurs by  million years and they are classed as plants not animals.A descent on a slippery and rocky track led them to a viewpoint complete with a wooden seat overlooking Cwrt yr Ala House away in the valley. Robert Rous owned Cwrt yr Ala in  and made many improvements to it and it remained within the family until the death of Georgina Anne Rous in . It then passed to Frances William George Gore, a nephew of the last male heir who preferred to remain in London, so he rented out the house to the renowned Cardf brewer W. H. Brain.Prior to  Mr Gore had tried to sell Cwrt yr Ala and the estate lands to Dr Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peatewho was looking for a suitable place for the newly proposed Welsh Folk Museum to be sited. In fact Peate was later offered land at St Fagans by the Earl of Plymouth for free as the site and became its first curator from  to . During World War Two he was temporarily dismissed for being a pacist and a conscientious objector, but soon reinstated..removeRecent heavy rainfall had made the normal descent via the bridleway a bit like a slalom so instead they followed tracks through the lower part of the wood to join a farm track at the top end of the steep-sided and wooded Cwm George.A rough farm track brought them to the stone bridge over the fast flowing Cadoxton River and out onto Cwrt-yr-Ala Road for the short journey into Michaelston-le-Pit where they made their way to St Michael and All Angels, to view the ‘sporting side’ of the churchyard where the Brain and Merrett families are buried before partaking of refreshments.William Henry Brainwas an English first-class cricketer and footballer who was noted for being the only man to perform the ‘wicket keeper’s hat trick’ of three dismissals off consecutive deliveries and also John Patrick Brain, a Welsh cricketer and wicketkeeper. Sir Herbert Henry Merrett who owned Cwrt yr Ala was a footballer and referee and chaired both Cardf City Football Club and was president of the Glamorgan County Cricket Club despite being a busy industrialist and Chairman of Powell Dyffryn Ltd. Another gravestone celebrated the Reverend Henry Holmes Stewart, a Scottish clergyman who was a member of the Wanderers team that won the FA Cup in  which was the same year he was ordained as a priest.Then making their way through riverside meadows and across a wooden footbridge, the surrounding trees were bearing pretty yellow catkins as they climbed uphill, then down to re-cross the river into the muddy Millfields and make their way back across the golf course to their start.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIn a report, entitled A UBI Pilot for Wales, the Petitions Committee concluded the current scheme for care leavers “has merit”, but that a wider trial would allow policymakers to learn more about the impact of a UBI.Universal Basic Income is the idea a government should pay all iniduals a set salary, regardless of their means.Last year, the country’s Labour government said it wanted to pilot such a scheme targeting  care leavers by giving them an additional sum of money each month.Proponents of the plans included those who believe UBI should apply to all citizens, and a petition submitted in August  calling for an expansion of the pilot gained over a thousands signatures.The committee, led by chair Jack Sargeant MS, invited a number of experts including Sophie Howe, the Future Generations Commissioner for Wales, Will Stronge, director of research at think tank Autonomy, Lydia Godden, Women’s Equality NetworkWales, and Ewan Hilton, CEO of mental health charity Platfform to give evidence on the topic.They concluded the government should consider increasing the size and ersity of the pilot scheme to provide more robust data, and ensure payments are guaranteed, unconditional, and paid to the inidual, not the household.It has also recommended the government make every effort to persuade UK Government departments such as the Department of Work and Pensions and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to support the widest possible pilot scheme.While they said the pilot should be conducted by independent experts, include a control group and attempt to capture any indirect savings or costs that accrue as a result of the pilot.Mr Sergeant said: “It’s clear from the evidence presented to us that broadening the pilot could have huge benefits.“The Welsh Government should investigate increasing the number of proposed recipients and include care leavers from as erse as possible a range of backgrounds, locations, and circumstances to give us the evidence we need to properly evaluate this scheme..remove“While not all Members of the Committee support UBI, we all believe that a wider pilot scheme has the potential to produce richer, more persuasive evidence for the Welsh Government to consider.“I would like to extend my thanks to the petitioners whose passion for tackling poverty shone through and should be commended, as well as all those who signed the petition.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
