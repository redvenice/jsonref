It was also reported that Diana picked out the jewel herself, while others claim that she chose it because it was the biggest and reminded her of her mother’s engagement ring.Princess Diana loved her engagement ring so much that she continued to wear it after her orce from Prince Charles in 1996 and it was made into a bracelet. She then started wearing an emerald-cut aquamarine ring in its place, the same one that Meghan Markle wore with her second wedding dress.          Princess Diana loved her engagement ring and continued to wear it after her orcePrincess Diana’s jewellery collectionGrant Mobley, a gemologist and Director at Pluczenik and one of the world’s leading diamantaires, said: ‘A beautiful ring that Princess Diana was seen wearing on her ring finger after her orce from Prince Charles was an emerald cut, aquamarine and diamond ring.He continued: ‘The Princess was very fond of a pearl and diamond bracelet featuring a large emerald cut aquamarine that she was given in her early years as a princess and, after her orce, she commissioned this matching ring to be made.‘Diana’s taste in jewellery was impeccable and the fact that she commissioned this ring to be made is a clear testament to her taste.           Meghan Markle seen here wearing Princess Diana\u0027s aquamarine ring to her wedding reception\u0027She always chose diamond jewellery that was meaningful to her - she was very intentional with her jewellery choices and made sure they were the best representation of those meaningful moments,’ he said, as reported in The Express.The aquamarine ring is thought to be around £75,000 because of the size, colour and quality of the centre diamond and a diamond from one of her rings was also used to make Meghan Markle’s engagement ring.Meghan Markle’s engagement ringDespite including a stone from Botswana and two diamonds from Princess Diana’s personal collection, Meghan Markle’s engagement ring was compared to one available from Argos for just £33. The ring was made by Cleave and Company, Court Jewellers and Medallists for Her Majesty.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle during an official photocall to announce their engagementSarah Filippardos, head jewellery buyer at Argos, told The Sun: \u0027Prince Harry\u0027s choice of a diamond trilogy ring for Meghan is beautiful. For anyone inspired by Harry\u0027s act of romance who isn\u0027t able to pop to Botswana for a diamond, Argos has a fantastic range of similar trilogy engagement rings with prices starting from as little as £32.99.\u0027However, TheDiamondStore.co.uk estimated that it cost £199,475 and the stone is likely to be a D in colour (the clearest). Meghan also paid tribute to her late mother-in-law on her wedding day and wore Diana’s engagement ring to her wedding reception.          Meghan Markle\u0027s ring includes a stone from Botswana and two from Princess Diana’s collectionKate Middleton’s engagement ringWhen Diana passed away in 1997, Prince William and Prince Harry inherited her jewellery collection, which included her engagement ring, according to Good Housekeeping. The late Princess wrote: ‘I would like you to allocate all my jewellery to the share to be held by my sons, so that their wives may, in due course, have it or use it. I leave the exact ision of the jewellery to your discretion.’          Prince William proposed to Kate Middleton with his mother, Princess Diana\u0027s engagement ringThere are rumours that while Harry originally picked out the iconic sapphire gem, after he saw William’s love for Kate Middleton, the Prince exchanged the engagement ring for his mother’s Cartier watch, so that the Duke of Cambridge could propose to this Duchess.          Kate Middleton\u0027s engagement ring is shown as she holds the arm of her fiance Prince WilliamPrince William reportedly had the ring with him for three weeks while they were on holiday in Mount Kenya in 2010 and when he announced the engagement, he said: ‘It’s my mother’s engagement ring, and it’s very special to me, as Kate is very special to me now as well.‘It was only right the two were put together. It was my way of making sure mother didn’t miss out on today and the excitement,’ the Duke said, as reported in Marie Claire.

I’d never even thought about that. It was all quite shocking,’ she says. ‘I’m very honest and don’t beat around the bush, but I didn’t expect the amount of vitriol.‘It was like a bomb had gone off. I didn’t even think I had said anything that bad, but I admit that perhaps I didn’t really think about it that much.’Liverpool-born Danielle had three sons, Archie, Harry and George, with her ex husband Jamie O’Hara, the former Tottenham Hotspurs midfielder. The couple orced in 2014. Her fourth son, Ronnie, is with her fiancé, electrician Michael O’Neill.She continues: ‘I want a girl and if I can pay for it, then that’s OK, I can get one.’          The 34-year-old, pictured at home, has received thousands of angry messages on Instagram and Twitter, some of them extreme, on the subject of gender selection for babies  Danielle and fiancé, electrician Michael O’Neill, during her pregnancy with fourth son RonnieIt is, as she has found, a highly controversial stance – which makes it all the more remarkable that Danielle has agreed to address it head-on.The WHO says that sex selection raises ‘serious moral, legal, and social issues’ and can lead to the devaluation of women and gender imbalance.For all the public and official hostility, though, the fact is that the industry is rapidly expanding to meet a huge and growing demand.And if in Britain the demand remains unspoken, in America it is rapidly becoming the norm for those who can afford it.Dr Jeffrey Steinberg at leading US specialists The Fertility Institutes says he routinely treats A-list actors, pop stars and athletes.Tellingly, of 640 couples who came through his doors in 2017, more than one in ten was British.According to Dr Daniel Potter at rival American clinic HRC Fertility, he sees ten patients a month from this country who want to select the gender of their baby.It is, after all, an age-old wish. From cave paintings depicting a preference for sons, to Aristotle’s prescription for producing boys (tying off of the man’s left testicle), attempts to choose the gender of children go back centuries. But Danielle’s decision to obtain – or effectively buy – a baby girl belongs firmly to the scientific realm.She had first heard about the gender selection procedure in the wake of giving birth to Ronnie, now ten months old. Enquiring further, she learnt that the treatment is accurate in 99 per cent of the cases in which a baby is successfully born and started to investigate the possibility of arranging for the selection of a girl child in Northern Cyprus, another state where it is legal.After further questioning, however, she and fiance Michael settled on America, where they felt the overall safeguards would be stronger.The couple will marry next year, and she will travel to California.    Danielle Lloyd, pictured with sons (from left) Harry, Ronnie, George and Archie, had three children with former Spurs player Jamie O\u0027Hara and one with electrician Michael O’NeillOnce there, a number of her eggs will be harvested and fertilised, and then one or two of the resulting female embryos will be reimplanted in the mother’s womb. The rest will be stored for possible use in the future.It will cost her about £12,000 plus flights and accommodation – and that’s just for one round.But to Danielle, getting the little girl that she craves is worth every penny.‘There’s an urge inside me to have a girl. I just can’t let it go,’ she explains.‘I’ve got such an amazing relationship with my mum. I want to have that bond with my daughter. Why would anyone begrudge me that?‘I also want my boys to have that brother-sister relationship. Our family is not yet complete.‘Michael feels the same way. He really wants a girl. If I had four girls, we’d be going off and getting a boy.‘Realistically, if I’m going to have one more, if this science is there, why not do it? I don’t think it’s a selfish thing to do. I could be selfish and go on for years having more and more boys.‘I’ve got four lovely boys but I don’t want to get to 50 or 60 and think I could have had a girl but didn’t,’ she adds.‘The thought of not going to my daughter’s wedding or not having those chats I have with my mum. Girls always have that relationship with their mothers.’Her television profile does, she admits, make her a lightning rod for criticism, particularly from those who assume she is not merely comfortably off, but rich. ‘People say, “I bet she’s got ten nannies”.          Danielle Lloyd (pictured at home) will go to America for the gender selection procedure, which has been condemned by the World Health Organisation (WHO)‘It really gets my back up. Actually, no. And, before Michael came along, I did it as a single mother.’She claims to understand her critics’ point of view, yet remains defiantly convinced she has the right to press ahead.‘When I mentioned it on television, people phoned in and said that if they did what I was doing in China, where they can have only one child, the population would be just boys,’ she says.‘They told me stories about baby girls being flushed down the toilet. It makes me feel like crying, but I’m nothing to do with that sort of world.‘If I was sitting here with no kids and saying I’m doing gender selection because I only want a girl and not a boy, then of course I’d expect criticism.‘But I’m not.‘I realise people have strong opinions. But I still don’t understand how anyone can call me a disgrace because I want a little girl as well as my boys. I genuinely don’t get what the big deal is.‘If we were having this debate in America, the attitude would be completely different because gender selection is perfectly legal and respectable there. It’s like IVF. They get the egg, artificially inseminate it and then check if the embryo is a girl or a boy.‘They give you the option of inserting one or two embryos. It might not work with one, so you’d have to pay again.‘Obviously there are women who can’t have children and I can totally understand that. To some of them, what I’m going to do makes me a terrible person.‘But at the same time, a lot of women have asked me to let them know where I’m going for the procedure, because they’d love to go there too.‘Women who had already been through it got in touch to pass on their advice.’Her sons, too, are right behind her, she says.‘They ask me every day “Mummy, have you got a baby sister in your tummy yet?” When it comes to birthdays and Christmases, they ask for a sister,’ says Danielle.‘I can see why some people think it’s wrong and selfish. Why don’t you just appreciate the children you’ve got? And, so on.‘But I really do appreciate them. I live for my children and love being a mum it’s what I was made to do.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/18/22/4F2EE1C300000578-0-image-a-18_1534627730751.jpg","title":"The inside story best selling childrens author Enid Blyton","story":"    Enid Blyton, pictured, produced more than 800 books during a 40-year career Yet away from the limelight and the jaunty fiction, her real world was complex and troubled – and exceedingly racy. Released to mark the 50th anniversary of her death, my book, The Real Enid Blyton, reveals that while the much-loved author meticulously crafted her public image, her private life was a riot of extramarital affairs – including the hint of a lesbian romance – summary betrayals and casual cruelty, a course of life far more suited to a modern day soap opera than her wholesome boarding school drama, Malory Towers.It is no small irony that the woman loved by children worldwide was not even a particularly good mother, for while Enid may have famously declared in reply to her critics that she was ‘not interested in the opinion of anyone over the age of 12’ she took little interest in her own dear offspring.The fact is marriage and motherhood had barely featured in young Enid’s sight lines.A published author by her twenties, and already on her way to becoming reasonably wealthy, she had shown very little interest in men. That is until she met Major Hugh Alexander Pollock, a former soldier ten years her senior who was an editor at the firm which became her regular publisher.          Enid Blyton was first married to Major Hugh Pollock, pictured on their wedding day in 1924Hugh was handsome, debonair and worldly, and Enid was charmed from the moment she met him. There was just one snag: Hugh was also married. True, he was separated, but such distinctions meant little in the buttoned-up 1920s, and openly courting a man who was married to someone else was still scandalous, not least for a former teacher turned children’s author.Still, Enid was certainly not the sort of woman to let such little things get in the way and, by 1924, barely a year after they had first met, she had become Mrs Pollock. Even by then the couple, while besotted, had engaged in the sort of furious rows which would foreshadow those that lay ahead.The baby both wanted took longer than they thought to arrive, six years to be precise, during which time Enid underwent pioneering fertility treatment in the form of daily hormone injections.Naturally, Enid was initially delighted with the arrival of her first-born, Gillian, in July 1931, although it was only a matter of weeks before she hired a full-time live-in nanny, Betty, to join the roster of staff she now employed at the family home, Old Thatch in Bourne End, Buckinghamshire.Betty not only looked after Gillian during the day but slept in the same room overnight, and by the start of 1932 Enid was spending barely an hour a day with her daughter.It says much about her priorities that, while she scarcely mentioned little Gillian in her diary entries for January of that year, she recorded updates on her new book almost every day. Betty didn’t last long: she was fired when Gillian fell out of her cot shortly after her first birthday, even though the baby was not hurt. Other staff too found that Enid could be a cold and unsympathetic employer. One maid was summarily sacked for going out with a friend who had developed scarlet fever, with Enid calling her a fool and accusing her of putting her family at risk.Enid’s second nanny was a rather different matter. Hired after the birth of Enid’s second daughter Imogen in 1935, Dorothy Richards, a trained nurse with a rather masculine appearance – she often dressed in a formal shirt and tie – quickly became far more than a humble employee.From the moment of Dorothy’s arrival, the pair struck up an intense friendship that long outlasted Dorothy’s employment and which quickly left Hugh feeling surplus to requirements. When they were not out for walks, the two shared private jokes and it was now Dorothy, not Hugh, to whom Enid turned to proofread early drafts of her work.So significant was their friendship that, over the years, it was implied they were lovers and ‘there may have been some homosexual attraction between these two women’, as Imogen would herself observe. Certainly the language in the letters they exchanged seems suffused with romantic attachment. ‘I want to hear all you have to say even if I argue at first,’ Enid wrote in one. ‘You can say anything to me. I want you to.’          Enid married her second husband Kenneth Waters in 1943 in Westminster There were other aspects to her character, too, that might have surprised her army of devoted readers – in particular, a lack of interest in her own children, starkly at odds with the warmth she projected through her writing.While Gillian and Imogen were routinely wheeled out to pose for happy family portraits, the reality was that Enid was a distant mother. In interviews, she spoke cheerfully about the delicate balancing act she performed between her writing career and her role as a devoted mother.Her daughters, however, scarcely recognised the domestic angel she claimed to be. Despite her career being devoted to improving children’s literacy, Enid hardly ever read to her children, while physical contact was more likely to involve a beating with a hairbrush than a cuddle. By the late thirties, there was little about Enid’s home life that in any way resembled the rosy-cheeked innocence of her stories.By 1938, she and Hugh, who by now was drinking heavily, were living virtually separate lives, with the encroaching war equipping Hugh with good reason to be away to help the war effort. What domestic energies Enid retained, meanwhile, seemed to be ploughed in to throwing glamorous parties at the family’s new palatial home, Green Hedges, in nearby Beaconsfield.So far so suburban – except that the guest lists frequently included a number of unattached young men, among them several young Army officers who had been posted nearby, as well as a bachelor doctor who moved in next door.It wasn’t long before Enid’s frantic socialising led to her becoming the subject of local whispers, not to mention the subject of gossip columns. One enjoyable rumour had it that visitors once arrived at the house to find their hostess playing tennis entirely naked.Hugh was furious when he came home to learn his wife had been entertaining men in an unsuitable way in his absence, although he scarcely had cause to complain, given he was himself cavorting with a young novelist called Ida Crowe – a development to which Enid was alerted by an anonymous phone call with the words: ‘Don’t let Ida crow over you.’By early 1941, the marriage was all but over, its fate sealed when Enid was persuaded by Dorothy to join her on a trip to visit her sister Betty Marsh at her home in Devon. Among Betty’s other guests was a surgeon called Kenneth Darrell Waters – Enid’s Malory Towers heroine Darrell Rivers would later be named in his honour – and from the first moment he and Enid met over a game of bridge one evening, it was love at first sight for both.As soon as they returned home they embarked on an affair, meeting in secret as often as they could. Enid rented a discreet flat in Knightsbridge to carry on their romantic liaisons – brazenly using Dorothy’s name to cover her tracks.In fact, she had no problem using her dear girlfriend as a scapegoat: when confronted at Green Hedges by Kenneth’s furious wife in the wake of her discovery of her husband’s betrayal, Enid not only made a complete denial but said Dorothy was the true culprit – a plausible excuse seeing as the flat was rented in her name. Dorothy was mortified, but said nothing out of loyalty to Enid. Enid’s books might have become synonymous with a strong moral and ethical code but this was sorely lacking in her private life. As Imogen later wrote: ‘For a whole year she carried on her lives with two different men, deceiving, or appearing to deceive, everyone.’Indeed, it was quite blatant: when her husband did return to the marital home in 1944 after a few weeks absence it was to find Kenneth staying there, his clothes hanging in the spare room.Humiliated, Hugh left home for good after one last bitter argument, although Enid concealed the fact from her daughters for over 18 months, using the war as an excuse.It would prove the start of an increasingly bitter rift.After insisting that she should be the one to launch the orce petition against him to avoid any adverse publicity – citing his adultery with Ida – Enid’s way of thanking her husband for his cooperation was to cut him out of their daughters’ lives, insisting they should focus instead on their exciting new future with her second husband, Kenneth, whom she married at the City of Westminster Register Office in October 1943.With Enid’s income soaring to well over £100,000 a year – around £4.3million today – the newlyweds could afford to indulge themselves.They employed a number of staff including a cook, maid and chauffeur to drive their fleet of cars, which now included a Bentley, a Rolls-Royce and an MG sports car. Enid would often spend entire days shopping at Harrods. One event proved unexpected. In 1945, at the age of 48, Enid discovered that she was pregnant again. Kenneth, who had always longed for a child, was delighted, and Enid, too, seemed pleased.Then, five months in, Enid fell while climbing a ladder to collect apples from a barn – something Kenneth had expressly forbidden her to do – and lost the baby.Devastated, Kenneth was never able to talk about it, but true to form Enid instead threw herself straight back into work with enthusiasm. Imogen later suggested Enid had, perhaps, deliberately risked her pregnancy by climbing the ladder.She wrote: ‘She would have been aware of the high risk of giving birth to a child with a defect at her age and her books were still the most important part of her life.’No one could dispute the latter: more literary success followed – among them the Noddy series.By 1957, however, Enid was suffering failing health which would dog her until the end of her days 11 years later. She died in a Hampstead nursing home on November 28, 1968, slipping away in her sleep at the age of 71, apparently untroubled that the world she portrayed so famously should bear so little relation to the life she had pursued. The Real Enid Blyton by Nadia Cohen is published by Pen \u0026amp Sword History, £19.99.

That will likely increase unemployment and further fuel mass emigration that has overwhelmed neighboring South American countries. As it stands, the monthly minimum wage - devastated by inflation and the aggressive devaluation of the bolivar - is still not enough to buy a kilo of meat.            Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela\u0027s socialist president, has presided over the country during one of the darkest periods in its history          Thousands of people have left Venezuela due to spiraling inflation rates and political unrest among the majority of the population.

Released to mark the 50th anniversary of her death, my book, The Real Enid Blyton, reveals that while the much-loved author meticulously crafted her public image, her private life was a riot of extramarital affairs – including the hint of a lesbian romance – summary betrayals and casual cruelty, a course of life far more suited to a modern day soap opera than her wholesome boarding school drama, Malory Towers.It is no small irony that the woman loved by children worldwide was not even a particularly good mother, for while Enid may have famously declared in reply to her critics that she was ‘not interested in the opinion of anyone over the age of 12’ she took little interest in her own dear offspring.The fact is marriage and motherhood had barely featured in young Enid’s sight lines.A published author by her twenties, and already on her way to becoming reasonably wealthy, she had shown very little interest in men. That is until she met Major Hugh Alexander Pollock, a former soldier ten years her senior who was an editor at the firm which became her regular publisher.          Enid Blyton was first married to Major Hugh Pollock, pictured on their wedding day in 1924Hugh was handsome, debonair and worldly, and Enid was charmed from the moment she met him. There was just one snag: Hugh was also married. True, he was separated, but such distinctions meant little in the buttoned-up 1920s, and openly courting a man who was married to someone else was still scandalous, not least for a former teacher turned children’s author.Still, Enid was certainly not the sort of woman to let such little things get in the way and, by 1924, barely a year after they had first met, she had become Mrs Pollock. Even by then the couple, while besotted, had engaged in the sort of furious rows which would foreshadow those that lay ahead.The baby both wanted took longer than they thought to arrive, six years to be precise, during which time Enid underwent pioneering fertility treatment in the form of daily hormone injections.Naturally, Enid was initially delighted with the arrival of her first-born, Gillian, in July 1931, although it was only a matter of weeks before she hired a full-time live-in nanny, Betty, to join the roster of staff she now employed at the family home, Old Thatch in Bourne End, Buckinghamshire.Betty not only looked after Gillian during the day but slept in the same room overnight, and by the start of 1932 Enid was spending barely an hour a day with her daughter.It says much about her priorities that, while she scarcely mentioned little Gillian in her diary entries for January of that year, she recorded updates on her new book almost every day. Betty didn’t last long: she was fired when Gillian fell out of her cot shortly after her first birthday, even though the baby was not hurt. Other staff too found that Enid could be a cold and unsympathetic employer. One maid was summarily sacked for going out with a friend who had developed scarlet fever, with Enid calling her a fool and accusing her of putting her family at risk.Enid’s second nanny was a rather different matter. Hired after the birth of Enid’s second daughter Imogen in 1935, Dorothy Richards, a trained nurse with a rather masculine appearance – she often dressed in a formal shirt and tie – quickly became far more than a humble employee.From the moment of Dorothy’s arrival, the pair struck up an intense friendship that long outlasted Dorothy’s employment and which quickly left Hugh feeling surplus to requirements. When they were not out for walks, the two shared private jokes and it was now Dorothy, not Hugh, to whom Enid turned to proofread early drafts of her work.So significant was their friendship that, over the years, it was implied they were lovers and ‘there may have been some homosexual attraction between these two women’, as Imogen would herself observe. Certainly the language in the letters they exchanged seems suffused with romantic attachment. ‘I want to hear all you have to say even if I argue at first,’ Enid wrote in one. ‘You can say anything to me. I want you to.’          Enid married her second husband Kenneth Waters in 1943 in Westminster There were other aspects to her character, too, that might have surprised her army of devoted readers – in particular, a lack of interest in her own children, starkly at odds with the warmth she projected through her writing.While Gillian and Imogen were routinely wheeled out to pose for happy family portraits, the reality was that Enid was a distant mother. In interviews, she spoke cheerfully about the delicate balancing act she performed between her writing career and her role as a devoted mother.Her daughters, however, scarcely recognised the domestic angel she claimed to be. Despite her career being devoted to improving children’s literacy, Enid hardly ever read to her children, while physical contact was more likely to involve a beating with a hairbrush than a cuddle. By the late thirties, there was little about Enid’s home life that in any way resembled the rosy-cheeked innocence of her stories.By 1938, she and Hugh, who by now was drinking heavily, were living virtually separate lives, with the encroaching war equipping Hugh with good reason to be away to help the war effort. What domestic energies Enid retained, meanwhile, seemed to be ploughed in to throwing glamorous parties at the family’s new palatial home, Green Hedges, in nearby Beaconsfield.So far so suburban – except that the guest lists frequently included a number of unattached young men, among them several young Army officers who had been posted nearby, as well as a bachelor doctor who moved in next door.It wasn’t long before Enid’s frantic socialising led to her becoming the subject of local whispers, not to mention the subject of gossip columns. One enjoyable rumour had it that visitors once arrived at the house to find their hostess playing tennis entirely naked.Hugh was furious when he came home to learn his wife had been entertaining men in an unsuitable way in his absence, although he scarcely had cause to complain, given he was himself cavorting with a young novelist called Ida Crowe – a development to which Enid was alerted by an anonymous phone call with the words: ‘Don’t let Ida crow over you.’By early 1941, the marriage was all but over, its fate sealed when Enid was persuaded by Dorothy to join her on a trip to visit her sister Betty Marsh at her home in Devon. Among Betty’s other guests was a surgeon called Kenneth Darrell Waters – Enid’s Malory Towers heroine Darrell Rivers would later be named in his honour – and from the first moment he and Enid met over a game of bridge one evening, it was love at first sight for both.As soon as they returned home they embarked on an affair, meeting in secret as often as they could. Enid rented a discreet flat in Knightsbridge to carry on their romantic liaisons – brazenly using Dorothy’s name to cover her tracks.In fact, she had no problem using her dear girlfriend as a scapegoat: when confronted at Green Hedges by Kenneth’s furious wife in the wake of her discovery of her husband’s betrayal, Enid not only made a complete denial but said Dorothy was the true culprit – a plausible excuse seeing as the flat was rented in her name. Dorothy was mortified, but said nothing out of loyalty to Enid. Enid’s books might have become synonymous with a strong moral and ethical code but this was sorely lacking in her private life. As Imogen later wrote: ‘For a whole year she carried on her lives with two different men, deceiving, or appearing to deceive, everyone.’Indeed, it was quite blatant: when her husband did return to the marital home in 1944 after a few weeks absence it was to find Kenneth staying there, his clothes hanging in the spare room.Humiliated, Hugh left home for good after one last bitter argument, although Enid concealed the fact from her daughters for over 18 months, using the war as an excuse.It would prove the start of an increasingly bitter rift.After insisting that she should be the one to launch the orce petition against him to avoid any adverse publicity – citing his adultery with Ida – Enid’s way of thanking her husband for his cooperation was to cut him out of their daughters’ lives, insisting they should focus instead on their exciting new future with her second husband, Kenneth, whom she married at the City of Westminster Register Office in October 1943.With Enid’s income soaring to well over £100,000 a year – around £4.3million today – the newlyweds could afford to indulge themselves.They employed a number of staff including a cook, maid and chauffeur to drive their fleet of cars, which now included a Bentley, a Rolls-Royce and an MG sports car. Enid would often spend entire days shopping at Harrods. One event proved unexpected. In 1945, at the age of 48, Enid discovered that she was pregnant again. Kenneth, who had always longed for a child, was delighted, and Enid, too, seemed pleased.Then, five months in, Enid fell while climbing a ladder to collect apples from a barn – something Kenneth had expressly forbidden her to do – and lost the baby.Devastated, Kenneth was never able to talk about it, but true to form Enid instead threw herself straight back into work with enthusiasm. Imogen later suggested Enid had, perhaps, deliberately risked her pregnancy by climbing the ladder.She wrote: ‘She would have been aware of the high risk of giving birth to a child with a defect at her age and her books were still the most important part of her life.’No one could dispute the latter: more literary success followed – among them the Noddy series.By 1957, however, Enid was suffering failing health which would dog her until the end of her days 11 years later. She died in a Hampstead nursing home on November 28, 1968, slipping away in her sleep at the age of 71, apparently untroubled that the world she portrayed so famously should bear so little relation to the life she had pursued. The Real Enid Blyton by Nadia Cohen is published by Pen \u0026amp Sword History, £19.99.

Pictured is a kilo of carrots costing 3,000,000 bolivars ($0.46)Jittery Venezuelans on Friday rushed to shops and formed long lines in preparation for the monetary overhaul.Shoppers and economists are now concerned Maduro\u0027s minimum wage increase could close thousands of stores across the country as companies will no longer be able to pay their workers.Although the wage increase will make it possible for Venezuelans to buy basic supplies, there may not be anywhere open to sell them.  Economists warned that some companies would go under, unable to shoulder the massive increase in monthly minimum wage from 3 million bolivars to 180 million bolivars, or roughly $0.5 to $30. That will likely increase unemployment and further fuel mass emigration that has overwhelmed neighboring South American countries. As it stands, the monthly minimum wage - devastated by inflation and the aggressive devaluation of the bolivar - is still not enough to buy a kilo of meat.            Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela\u0027s socialist president, has presided over the country during one of the darkest periods in its history          Thousands of people have left Venezuela due to spiraling inflation rates and political unrest among the majority of the population.

Also, it is a colour that suffers from social stigma and cliches, so it’s fun to work with that and go against the grain of the prejudice.” Pancrazi now lives in Oxford, and his photographic series began with a desire to revisit the Mediterranean city where he grew up. “It started as an aestheticisation of my home town and the memories I had there,” he explains. “Living abroad, in a fairly different climate, prompted me to find the reality that was hidden beyond those ethereal memories.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4a443eebdac317b303d4f03e028dbefa403fc4c/226_538_3333_2000/master/3333.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e91273f830e4daaa3e6b160d9b8b47d7","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"The death of Aretha Franklin, the bridge collapse in Genoa and a scrambling turtle – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfc069302c2b2414fceb112546d0a79e95d18a43/0_206_5893_3535/master/5893.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e04e8230df4e31b1eec37b9ba9e304dc","title":"dream job desert island maldives bookseller","story":"Wanted: barefoot bibliophile willing to punt Daniel Defoe to rich, modern-day Robinson Crusoes at a luxury desert island resort.“The pay is derisory but the fringe benefits unparalleled,” Blackwell said. “The role will evolve and it is in part up to you to make the most of this unique opportunity. It’s a dream job for many people. If I was 25 again I would do it.”The successful applicant will be expected to sign up for a minimum of three months, during which time they must write “an entertaining and lively blog that captures the exhausting life of a desert island bookseller”. Oh, and mingle with A-list celebrities and their friends.They should have “a passion for books, the ability to engage guests of all ages”, be able to entertain children with storytelling and host creative writing courses for guests.“We want someone on the ground who is creative and inspiring and can maybe get more people to share the pleasure of reading, which is what people enjoy doing on holiday,” Blackwell said.They will also live near the exclusive resort, which is described as lying “among dense foliage on beaches with sand as soft as snow,” within the Baa Atoll biosphere reserve.Villas at the resort range in price from about $2,000 a night for a one-bed property up to nearly $26,000 for the nine-bedroom Private Reserve, described in promotional material as a “playful deserted-island mansion”, with its own swimming pool, spa, sauna and steam room.“I’d imagine the nation’s hard-pressed booksellers might quite fancy a spell on a desert island, away from the woes of the high street this is one gig Amazon can’t spoil,” said Neill Denny, joint editor of the industry journal BookBrunch, which first revealed the job opportunity. “It’s very much a niche in a niche, selling quality books to the super-rich, but they are starting to appreciate the discreet charm of a good book. And of course they have the money to pursue it, building entire libraries from scratch. This is a trend luxury cruise ships and high-end hotels are starting to tap into. Anyone can read anything on a Kindle but only a discerning few can afford a wall full of first editions.”The shop will stock a mix of books that reflect the local environment, including the colourful marine life, as well as titles that reflect the interests of the wealthy tourists. “They are highly educated, enquiring people who want to relax and get away from things but also think a bit and better themselves,” Blackwell said.The bookshop is a new experiment for Blackwell, who gave up running the British bookshop chain that bears his name in 2006 after the family sold the business. The resort shop is an extension of his Ultimate Library business, which he set up almost accidentally while travelling the world after leaving Blackwell’s. Finding it tricky to source suitable reading matter on his holidays, he came up with idea of creating library collections for resort hotels. He now has more than 250 projects around the world, including more than 30 luxury hotels and resorts as well as a cruise ship, a Kenyan game reserve and a London private members’ club.For every hotel library supplied, the company also helps donate a reading and reference library to a local institution that can benefit those who live nearby.“It’s a gap year project that’s still going on,” Blackwell joked. If it is a commercial success, he says he may consider opening more: “The Males is not over-endowed with bookshops.”But applicants need to be aware that not all is well in paradise. Journalists and opposition figures live in a climate of oppression under the authoritarian president Abdulla Yameen. Last year a blogger who satirised the political and religious establishment was stabbed to death in the capital, Malé. The barefoot bookseller role is the latest in a series of dream jobs – for some – to come on the market. Last year Belgian Stan Vanuytrecht, 58, won a competition to live as a hermit in a cliffside cell above an Austrian town. The former artillery officer beat 49 other candidates to secure the position as one of Europe’s last hermits.In 2009 a British charity worker, Ben Southall, staved off competition from almost 35,000 worldwide applicants to win a £73,000 contract to serve as the caretaker of a tropical Australian islandIn 2013 Tourism Australia repeated the exercise, looking for six candidates, including a wildlife caretaker, to look after koalas and sunbathe with seals on Kangaroo Island.

It allows us to see that, while we are all human and we fail, we can change Because we live in such very dark times, I’ve been thinking about laughter and art.If you feel as I do, some days you’ll see no hope for humanity. We’ve destroyed much of the planet already and seem hellbent on continuing that destruction. People all over the world suffer unspeakable violence and deprivation. We in affluent countries seem unwilling to share our wealth with others, and we spend our time and money on pursuits that wreak ever more environmental destruction.At the same time, those of us in wealthy nations suffer ever-rising levels of anxiety and depression. Australians have the second highest rate of antidepressant use in the world. What can simple laughter possibly do to counteract all of this?It might seem a trivial thing to be talking about, when the world is in such trouble. You might expect that I’m about to advocate fiddling while our planet burns, urging you to enjoy a kind of nihilistic amusement at what we’ve done to ourselves. But nothing could be further from my mind. The embrace of laughter in our art and in ourselves is an ethical choice that we can and must make I’m idealistic enough to suggest that if we think seriously about laughter and what it means, we might even begin to save our planet.The first question, of course, is what do I mean when I use the word laughter, as opposed to comedy, or satire, or even humour. The distinction is a little difficult to make but it’s an important one for me, because I don’t think comedy can save the world. I dearly wish it could.What I mean is something beyond, and broader than, comedy. I mean a sense of lightness, of joy, the sense of possibility that comes when laughter enters a work of literature, whether it’s manifest on the page itself or merely as part of the writer’s process. For laughter is a sharp instrument, as it turns out, capable of performing many crucial, and I think profound, functions.I’ve been drawn to thinking about laughter lately because for the past three years, since publication of my novel The Natural Way of Things – and for the preceding three years during which I wrote it – I’ve been thinking and speaking so much about anger. That book concerned our society’s punishment of young women for speaking out against sexual mistreatment, and it was published in 2015, a couple of years before the #MeToo movement exploded across the globe. It took me a long time to accept my own anger about the degradation of women in our culture. I don’t consider that I personally have been oppressed in any significant way, other than in the ways all women are – and that is a mark of my privilege and the many forms of pure luck that have visited me through my life. But on behalf of my gender and the inequality we continue to fight, angry I certainly have been. I still am.It has taken me until deep in middle age before I learned that anger could be a productive creative tool. Creative anger, as I think of it now, is the kind of fury that can be channelled and harnessed. It burns slow and low, as fuel for producing art full of charge and fire and power.But while it can be artistically productive – even absolutely liberating – when anger is not balanced with other energy sources it is also, in my experience, completely exhausting. If I want to keep working, writing purely from anger would be impossible.But more importantly, I’ve come to realise that, for me, laughter – by which I mean this sense of lightness and pleasure and optimism – might in fact be productive anger’s most effective, most powerful friend.Laughter and pain are inextricably linked in life, as anyone who has made a black joke at a loved one’s deathbed knows. A friend of mine whose brother died as a small baby tells me that when her father sat the other children down to tell them this horrific news, she and her brother – and her father too – began to laugh. They roared laughing, in fact. And then they cried.Just before my own father died, when my siblings and I were teenagers, he told us not to feel guilty if we found ourselves laughing about his death. “Inappropriate” laughter, he so compassionately told us, was a natural impulse, of which we must never be ashamed.So what is it, this human instinct to laugh through tears? Maybe it’s a pressure-release valve. Maybe it’s a psychic expression of disbelief – a refusal to accept that what is happening can actually be happening. Or perhaps laughter at terrible times simply releases some badly needed chemical, some pain relief for the soul. Whatever the reasons, of course laughter and hurt are inextricably linked in literature as in life.When I think of this, I think of Amy Bloom’s sassy, bittersweet literary voice, or George Saunders’ tender absurdist stories, or his frolicsome spirit at work in the devastating Lincoln in the Bardo, where ghosts who do not understand they are dead live and yearn in the graveyard alongside President Lincoln’s lost son.But it’s not only in the subject matter of books that laughter can be found – but in form and language, even grammar and punctuation. I recently heard the Irish novelist Anne Enright articulate this beautifully, in describing the narrative voice of Gina, the heroine of her novel about marriage and infidelity, The Forgotten Waltz.“I tend to shift tone from paragraph to paragraph and sentence to sentence, and even sometimes on either side of a comma,’ said Enright. ‘You get a kind of ironic shift or lift, or you realise something was a bit of a joke but you’re not quite sure what the joke was. Gina is … full of jokes, which isn’t quite a sense of lightness, it’s almost a sense of hurt, expressed as lightness – irony being a kind of distance you have from yourself or the situation. That remove, that disconnect, is not always a joyful one but it’s quite a powerful one.”Enright seems here to be talking about voice itself as a manifestation of laughter through hurt language itself as a form of analgesia.Hurt is present, too, in aspect of laughter – laughter as defiance, as resistance.Here my thoughts turn most immediately to satirical writing – to dark political comedies like Joseph Heller’s Catch 22 perhaps, or Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse Five. But in thinking about social critique and laughter I’m just as likely to turn to Jane Austen, and the way her wit so sharply exposes the injustices of the class and gender restrictions of her era. In contemporary Australian literature, I think of the work of Wayne Macauley, with his strange, black novels about social alienation in the late capitalist era. And I think, too, of Michelle de Kretser’s dazzlingly sharp scalpel, and the incisions she makes into privileged, well-meaning progressive thinking on race and class and power in books like Questions of Travel and her latest, The Life to Come.Satire is often perceived as a rather chilly art form some might even say cynical – but I think it’s important to note that the best satire is born of deep idealism. As the British writer Anita Brookner said, “Satire depends on strong beliefs, and on strong beliefs wounded.” Both Michelle de Kretser and Wayne Macauley have echoed this in recent statements of their own. De Kretser, in a conversation at the Sydney Writers festival this year, raised the adage that if you scratch a cynic you’ll find a wounded idealist. When I interviewed Wayne Macauley for my book The Writers Room, about the often bleakly funny version of Australia to be found in his fiction, I asked him, “Have you ever been idealistic?” He answered, “I’m incredibly idealistic. That’s the problem! If I didn’t think about all the potential … I’d be very different. But I do have idealism – ridiculous, ludicrous idealism when I think about it.”Aside from satire, though, there’s a less obvious, more surprising form of laughter as resistance, one that I first noticed in the fiction of Kim Scott. Scott, a Noongar man and two-time Miles Franklin winner, is very much aware of a sense of humour as a powerful weapon in his work. It’s wielded not as satire but a form of playfulness. I asked Scott about this, about his books’ capacity for joy even while speaking of monstrous cultural destruction and the most dreadful abuses of Aboriginal people.This is what he said about the humour in his first novel, Benang: “I knew what I was doing. I was trying to make fun of some of the really shitty stuff … it defuses some of the hurtfulness that’s in there, I think, by playing with it. And it also seemed gutsy to play in that context. It seemed courageous – not only because it was difficult to sort of psych yourself up to do that. But because it might also be seen as an unworthy way to deal with nasty shit like that, to play with it. It is a source of such hurt and damage, you know, what are you doing playing? … It’s not an appropriate response. But it seemed very necessary.”Along with music and dancing – two other forms of laughter, I’d suggest – these bubbles of optimism and joy play out again and again in Scott’s work.Laughter as courage, as taking charge of your own history and pushing back against oppression by saying “no – I decide what material I get to be playful with” – this seems to me not only a profound statement but a very beautiful one.This sense of play brings me to my third point – laughter as a generative, creative force.Just as anger can be fuel for art, laughter does the same work in a different way. It can operate sometimes as a key change in a dark work, bringing lightness into gloom and providing a balancing energy. I hope, for example, that the darkness of my novel The Natural Way of Things is ameliorated for the reader not only by little blasts of beauty but by moments of comedy and lightness. In this way, laughter can provide a breathing space for the reader, a moment to gulp some fresh air and sunshine before plunging back into the hard stuff.But there is also, in the creative process itself, a very important role for play, for mischief. It’s this form of humour, or laughter, that I think provides a crucial creative energy for art. A while back I wrote a PhD thesis on the cognitive processes of creativity. One of the nine processes I identified in a small longitudinal study of five writers was what I ended up calling “overturning or disruption”. This process is evident in a writer’s urge to change tack, to throw a ner in the works. It’s that part of our creativity that behaves like a mischievous imp, moving through a narrative and flipping over our carefully constructed ideas and orderly scenes. For me, this is an essential and hugely energetic part of creativity. It often comes from a sense of boredom with the work as it stands, even – sometimes especially – if the existing work is perfectly well-made.In my own experience, some of the most important creative discoveries I’ve made have arisen from this playful, experimental urge to simply poke a hole in something, or blow things up. George Saunders alluded to this urge when talking about the structure of his masterpiece Lincoln in the Bardo.Humour has always been used, very effectively, to puncture inflated emotions or overturn pious ideals. I think the kind of laughter I most enjoy in contemporary novels is that where the characters are behaving badly – especially if they are women. In popular culture, representations of women to a large degree still fall into those two restrictive categories so clearly identified by Anne Summers more than 40 years ago in her landmark book, Damned Whores and God’s Police.In this world, for a writer to encourage good women to behave poorly seems to me an extraordinarily liberating act. One of my favourite writers is Alice Thomas Ellis, an English writer who died in 2005 at 72 after producing a dozen novels. The New York Times described Thomas Ellis’s fiction as “unflinching dissections of middle class domestic life” – and they are. Often, what she’s unflinchingly dissecting is the minutiae of relationships between women.Another writer I greatly admire is Elizabeth Strout, the Pulitzer-prize winning author of Olive Kitteridge, among other books. Strout has said some interesting things about truth and laughter. When she first began writing, for a long time her fiction was rejected. After enduring this for many years, she says, she had a hunch that it was being rejected because she wasn’t being altogether honest in her work. There was something she was avoiding writing about. Strout’s rather unconventional response to this hunch was to enrol in a stand-up comedy class. In a recent interview, she said she’d always known that people laugh at something when it’s true. In the years her writing wasn’t working, she thought, “I must not be saying something truthful. I thought, what would happen to me if I had to stand there and have an immediate response from the audience? What would come out of my mouth? It was like putting myself in a pressure cooker.”She took the class and the final exam was to perform at a New York comedy club, where she found her comic voice, sending herself up as “this really uptight white woman from New England … I was just such a white woman and so much from New England that I didn’t even know that about myself until I began to make fun of it. I was finally realising, oh, this is who I am.” After that, she began writing about an uptight white woman from New England, and her work took off. People laugh at things that are true, Strout reminds us.The most electric thrill of truthful recognition comes, it often seems, when what’s being revealed is something shameful or ugly in human behaviour.When we reveal the things that show us to be smaller, less worthy than we thought, we’re making ourselves vulnerable. At points of revelation like these, laughter is a very powerful tool of connection. It allows us to see that we are all human we are all children we all fail. There’s a sense of shared relief immediately attended, I think, by a shared forgiveness.My friend the writer and critic Tegan Bennett Daylight has taught creative writing for many years at universities. The first thing she tries to teach her students is to laugh at themselves. “I ask them to cultivate a sense of humour as they write,” she told me. In a clear echo of Strout’s stand-up discovery, she said, “When we’re laughing at ourselves we’re being honest about who we are – we’re telling the truth.” There’s something profound in this. The ability to laugh at ourselves reflects a crucial flexibility and openness in our thinking. Laughing at yourself means acknowledging your fallibility. It shows you know you might be wrong.I think this self-questioning is also embedded in a writer’s capacity for humour, even when it’s not visible on the page. In this form, the laughter is like an underground river of possibility and goodwill, flowing along beneath the work: you can’t see it, but you feel the strength of its current beneath you as you read.Is it too much of a stretch to believe that this lightness, a sense of the possibility for joy, can allow us to face ourselves, to pause and question our own certainties? It seems crucial now to develop the ability to examine our most deeply held beliefs anew. And to discover that sometimes, we’re wrong.I think that if we can do this, we must. If we can overturn an expectation, seize the power to play with dangerous material, if we can use laughter to tell difficult truths and harness it as a powerful creative force, all of this means we can imagine a moment to be different from what we thought it was. If we can imagine a moment to be different, then we can imagine a world to be different.Laughter has optimism embedded in it. As an ethical choice it is a refusal to accept that what we’ve already done is irrevocable, that the damage looming before us is inevitable, that the world is unchangeable. It shows instead that – just maybe - a new world might be there to be made.This is an edited version of a speech delivered to the Bendigo Writers Festival"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b709a651ad17b4172d5c4fb5aac54c210d7adcc/79_422_5208_3125/master/5208.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2c9282fbc4fa2c768779fa81f07165b","title":"paul nicklen if lose ice lose entire ecosystem arctic antarctic greenland photographs polar bears","story":"The photographer has been documenting life at the poles for years. He is determined to safeguard these fragile habitatsWhen he was four years old, Paul Nicklen’s family moved to Kimmirut on Baffin Island, northern Canada a village so remote that supplies are delivered once a year, by boat. The Nicklens were one of only two non-Inuit families in the tiny community, and with no telephone, radio or TV, Paul’s childhood was spent on the ice, in the company of native fishermen and in awe of the visual majesty of the region. “I learned how to freeze,” he says. It is a skill that has helped him to become one of the world’s foremost photographers of polar wildlife.“If you want to shoot the best photography of a particular ecosystem, you have to be comfortable wherever you are,” says Nicklen. “If that’s 150ft deep under the ice, you can’t be sitting there fighting for survival. You need to free up your mind.” Wearing a rebreather to avoid producing bubbles, he stays submerged for up to six hours, submitting himself to the same conditions inhabited by his favourite species. To Nicklen, the Arctic is not a forbidding, alien landscape, but a spiritual home: “I’m far more comfortable around bears than, say, on the streets of New York.”Nicklen’s profound understanding of polar environments has led him to produce some of the most extraordinary wildlife photography ever seen: narwhals duelling among ice floes, dozens of emperor penguins bursting from the water, a dying polar bear rooting through litter. In one now famous series, documented in a viral TED talk, he spent hours photographing a huge and fearsome leopard seal as she attempted to feed him with dead penguins. These and countless other photographs are collected in the forthcoming book, Born to Ice, Nicklen’s most comprehensive monograph to date. To read the book is to experience a kind of snow blindness, as ever more arresting animal portraits stare out from the waves and tundra.Most of Nicklen’s photographs have been taken on assignment for National Geographic magazine, for whom he has shot 22 stories to date. During this time Nicklen, now 50, has won a catalogue of awards including five World Press Photo prizes and the grand title in the Natural History Museum’s Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. Along with his TED talk and his 4.4 million Instagram followers, these have given him an unusually high profile for a nature photographer. But for all his public acclaim, the end goal of his work is not recognition of the photographs themselves, but the opportunity to educate and inspire people about the front line of conservation. “Photography has the power to break down the walls of apathy,” he says, “to grab people at the heart and then teach them something. You can change their minds, but you have to make that emotional connection first.”A former marine biologist, Nicklen is painfully aware of the future that faces his beloved Arctic and Antarctic habitats if urgent action isn’t taken. “When people think of sea ice melting, they think of this lifeless substance, like ice in a glass,” he says. “But it’s a very complex substrate. You have up to 300 species of microorganism living in the salt brine channels of a piece of sea ice.” The collapse of this bioersity is one of his main concerns. “Sea ice is like soil in a garden: the sun’s energy penetrates, and you get algae growing under the ice, and seaweed, which provides the food base for zooplankton. Billions of pounds of amphipods and copepods are growing under there, and it’s the same with krill. Then you have the polar cod that feed on the krill, and from there you have beluga whales, narwhals, bearded seals, Greenland sharks. If we lose the ice, we stand to lose the entire ecosystem.”Growing up near the Arctic Circle, Nicklen has a more immediate understanding of climate change. He recalls being a child in the 1970s, joining the Inuit as they travelled from Baffin Island to Greenland to trade huskies, using an ice bridge across the sea. “Since the 80s, those Inuit haven’t been able to use that bridge,” he says. “It’s gone. For the first time in recorded history, the entire Greenland icecap is melting.”Nicklen was taught survival skills by his Inuit neighbours as a child, and he still relies on the expertise of Inuits and Canadian First Nations for his work. Inuits and their sled teams feature prominently in his photographs, and their first-hand experience of climate change shapes his thinking. “When we were working in Greenland, at 81 degrees north,” he says, “the Inuit were sitting there fishing. One of them pulled up a fish, and all of a sudden they’re getting their iPhones out of their polar bear pants, because it’s a species none of them has ever seen before.” The anecdote has all the drama and urgency of a Nicklen photograph: a snapshot of life under threat of irreparable change.With this urgency in mind, In 2014 Nicklen and his partner, fellow photographer Cristina Mittermeier, founded SeaLegacy, an organisation devoted to raising awareness about marine conservation. “We think about money, love, sex, every minute of every day.” he says, “We have to be thinking about money, love, sex and the environment.”Although the challenges seem vast, Nicklen has built his glittering career on the belief that change can begin with one photograph of one inidual creature. He recalls with particular delight his experience of tracking and photographing a spirit bear – a vanishingly scarce and elusive subspecies of the American black bear that lives in the coastal forests of British Columbia. “To watch this bear walking through the forest, eating skunk cabbage, going to sleep under a cedar tree, is something I’ll never forget,” says Nicklen. “He was having these little puppy dreams with his breath fogging up my lens, and I just knew I was getting the visual assets that will make people care.”For information about SeaLegacy and for works available as fine art, contact zoe@sealegacy.org • Born to Ice is published by teNeues (£80).

As demand outstrips legal supply, ers from the poor suburbs of Cape Town are making up the shortfallA muscular, bald man moved through the kelp, hunting forbidden shellfish. His scuba rig bubbled and hissed. He was nearly 100 metres from the seashore and 20 metres below the surface, which was grey and flat like a lake. The water was clear, giving far range of sight. Below him the seafloor spread out until it blurred into nothingness.It was dangerous territory, but Shuhood (not his real name) accepted the risks. For more than a decade he’d been an abalone poacher, lifting a marine snail worth hundreds of pounds per kilo in Asia from reefs around South Africa. The first time he’d used scuba gear, without training, he’d almost drowned, held down by his weight belt and a mesh bag stuffed with abalone. Another day, his air hose broke underwater, and he blacked out as he swam up to the surface. One night the skipper of a boat he was working on ran him over while fleeing a police patrol vessel, and Shuhood was almost chopped by the propellers. Months later, a poacher was decapitated in a similar incident off Robben Island.On this afternoon in 2015, Shuhood was in False Bay, on the opposite side of Cape Town’s southern peninsula. The area is home to one of the world’s greatest concentrations of great white sharks. At least six shark attacks had been recorded in the previous decade, three of them fatal. Two people had been killed just a few hundred metres away, at Fish Hoek beach. “You try not think about it,” says Shuhood, who is in his mid-forties. “You’re always aware, but if you think shark, shark, shark you’re not gonna get any work done.”But his partner that day was less composed. Adam was an overweight young shoe salesman and it was only his third e. Shuhood had banned his own son from poaching, but Adam was more difficult to deter. He’d begun working for his father, Shuhood’s former brother-in-law, who also poached abalone it was Adam’s job to drive their catch to buyers in the fishing settlement of Hout Bay. There he’d met poachers his age and been impressed by their lifestyles, even more so against the poverty of their neighbourhood, a knot of tenements and shanties rising above the harbour. The poachers drove fast cars and wore expensive trainers. The sea, they often said, was their bank. Their abalone sold for more than £20 per kilo on the black market in a single e they could earn the monthly salary of a teacher, roughly £750. Without telling his father, Adam saved up for second-hand scuba gear. “If we didn’t teach him,” says Shuhood, “he was gonna go with someone else.”Now Shuhood and Adam were alone, with Shuhood’s younger brother standing lookout on land. The two ers worked facing each other, watching for sharks behind each other’s backs. The reefs near to shore had been cleaned out by other poachers, but they’d found a good patch of abalone further out. Many of the shells were wider than soup bowls, clamped fast against the rocks. To loosen them, the men used metal levers before shucking the abalone (prising them from their shells) and tossing them into their bags. “Next thing, I saw his terrified eyes in the goggles, looking past me,” Shuhood says. Circling them was a great white shark.Abalone is found on the coastlines of every continent except Antarctica. Prepared correctly, its flesh is tender, with a buttery seafood taste. In many countries this has rendered the creature a delicacy, often to its detriment. Channel Islanders know abalone as the ormer and may only hunt for it during strictly regulated “ormering tides”, so severely have stocks declined. In 1969, police in Guernsey effected Britain’s first underwater arrest when they caught a man ormering illegally at St Peter Port harbour. Yet nowhere on Earth is abalone more coveted than in China, where it has been associated with status for more than 2,000 years, first as a mainstay of royal banquets and more recently as an aspirational food for the middle class. This has given rise in South Africa to an illicit trade in the mollusc, driven by high prices and pervasive inequality. (As measured by the Gini coefficient, South Africa is the world’s least equal society, and half the population is considered chronically poor.)Along with shark fin, sea cucumbers and the swim bladders of certain fish, abalone is regarded as one of four “marine treasures” in Cantonese cuisine, served to honour guests or celebrate special occasions, particularly over Chinese New Year. A dish containing all four ingredients is called Buddha Jumps Over the Wall – the story goes that a monk, purportedly vegetarian, leapt over onto someone’s property when he smelled it cooking. In Hong Kong, premium versions can cost £420.On its own, abalone is usually braised in a rich broth. Its price varies greatly by size, form and country of origin. Dried abalone, which has fuller flavour, is more expensive than live, fresh, frozen or canned product. Japanese abalone, meticulously air-dried, is considered best of all, with South African abalone – a species found nowhere else on Earth – typically next. “Japanese abalone will be on the front page of the menu South African will be on the second,” explained Lau Chun, chef at Kin’s Kitchen, an upmarket restaurant in Hong Kong. (Chun sources his abalone legally, though there are no laws preventing his suppliers buying poached product.) “If Japanese abalone is a Mercedes, South African is a Honda – reliable, good value.”The strength of this reputation is evident in Hong Kong, the nexus of China’s luxury seafood market. South African abalone sells in all the dried seafood stores, hardened into tough nuggets that must be rehydrated, like shiitake mushrooms, before serving. The city’s biggest beer promotion last summer, for a pale lager called Blue Girl, offered South African abalone as a prize. According to research by Traffic, a nonprofit group that monitors illegal wildlife trades, nearly two-thirds of the dried abalone entering Hong Kong each year originates in South Africa. Of this total, an estimated two-thirds is from the black market.The illicit trade is controlled by Chinese criminals, who source their product from local gangs, often in exchange for drugs such as methamphetamine – known as tik in South Africa – or its chemical precursors. Abalone is dried in clandestine cookhouses in South Africa before being sent to Hong Kong, usually via neighbouring African countries with laxer borders and no laws for policing the abalone trade. Trucks routinely cross into Namibia or Zimbabwe or Mozambique with abalone in false compartments or hidden among boxes of dried fruit. It is a bizarre supply chain, from the shores of South Africa to plates in China.In the last 25 years, according to Traffic, syndicates have exported more than 50,000 tonnes of the shellfish, equivalent to some 130 million abalone. The annual illicit catch exceeds 3,000 tonnes, averaging eight tonnes every single day. The legal catch, set by the South African government, is 30 times smaller. Selected at random, a piece of dried abalone in Hong Kong is most likely to have been poached by ers such as Shuhood.This has pushed the species towards the point beyond which harvesting it will no longer be profitable for the legal industry. Abalone once smothered shallow reefs along South Africa’s western and southern shores. Now only traces remain: small patches and scattered iniduals that have escaped detection or are too dangerous to reach. Already the government has suspended recreational harvesting and briefly closed down the legal fishery, though in the face of rampant poaching neither step reduced pressure on stocks.Authorities arrest poachers or confiscate poached abalone almost weekly, but this has had little deterrent on an industry that employs more than 5,000 people. According to Markus Burgener, a researcher at Traffic, poaching has steadily increased over the past five years, and is now at its highest-ever levels. Multiple agencies share responsibility for stopping poaching – including the police, fisheries department and national parks service – but they are chronically short-staffed and plagued by corruption. For most poachers, jail terms are seldom longer than a year, and convictions are rare in South Africa’s overburdened court system. Few kingpins controlling the trade, whether Chinese or South African, are ever caught.Shuhood had seen a great white once before, minutes after climbing out the water at Robben Island. It was late and he’d shone his e lamp off the boat, a five-metre inflatable. “That shark was longer than the boat,” he told me. In False Bay, the animal swimming towards him was half the size, he guessed, but still would have weighed more than 500 kilos. It moved lazily, swinging its tail from side to side. Its jaw hung open, and Shuhood could see its teeth.He signalled to Adam and kicked towards a boulder. They’d moved beyond the kelp and were exposed. With their backs to the rock Shuhood showed Adam the quick-release clips on his scuba rig. “We used our cylinders as shields,” says Shuhood. “The only thing a shark won’t be able to bite.”Minutes later, the shark left them, fading into the murk of the sea. Shuhood pulled on his rig to resume work. “At the end of the day, everybody is a bit scared of sharks, but are you gonna let your fear overpower you?” he tells me. But Adam was petrified, waving at his uncle to return to the surface. “I needed to speak to him,” says Shuhood, “so I went up.”In False Bay, great whites habitually hunt seals from below, striking at speeds reaching 10 metres per second often this launches them clear of the water. “You’re on top and you don’t know what predators are underneath you. It’s safer to be down there so you can watch them,” Shuhood says.Adam was crying when they broke the surface. “Please, uncle,” he begged. “Please, let’s get out.”Underwater, Shuhood had seen Adam throw his mesh bag away. Now Adam told him that he had dropped it by mistake. “I can’t work, uncle. I lost it. Please, can we go.” Right then Shuhood slapped him, “not hard, just to get him out of his panic”. To his nephew he said: “Do you want to return to shore alone?”Shuhood’s brother, waiting on rocks below the railway tracks, was dwarfed by the distance. Beneath them the water dropped into darkness. Adam followed Shuhood back under until their cylinders were empty. He sold all his ing gear the next day, and never poached abalone again.The abalone spends its adult life peeping out over a muscular foot. Its tiny face has eyes on yellow stalks and a puckered mouth with two tentacles. Pressed against a glass aquarium – at Chinese restaurants that sell live abalone, for instance – this mouth looks strangely expressive, as if it is flung open in song. Because of its face the creature is easier to identify with than, say, a mussel, but this does not in the least bit trouble ers like Shuhood.The natural diet of the abalone consists of kelp and other seaweeds, which it methodically abrades with its tongue. The residue passes through its digestive tract, foul-smelling and bitter. “First thing you do after shucking,” says Shuhood, making a quick movement with both hands, “is twist off the guts.”The shell grows in a clockwise spiral, a row of ventilation holes perforating its leading edge. Its shape is described by the scientific name shared by all abalone species: Haliotis, from the Greek for “sea” and “ear”. The outer surface is rutted and grey, the inside pearlescent and smooth. Perlemoen, the Afrikaans name for abalone, is derived from the Dutch for mother of pearl. There is an exquisite beauty to the shell, used since ancient times for jewellery, yet it is the flesh of the abalone, composed chiefly of its broad foot, that has made it so valuable. The result is a smuggling epidemic of snail feet, for displays of social status.Before Chinese demand boomed, abalone had more ordinary value in South Africa – an item of subsistence, cheaply available. The shells were so abundant that people used them as ashtrays. Now, harvesting abalone for personal use is illegal, and the only restaurants stocking it serve Chinese tourists, displaying the creatures in large tanks. The going rate is £130 per kilo, including the weight of the shell. Ostensibly, the abalone is sourced from farms or the shrinking legal fishery, though poachers say certain restaurants buy directly from them. Here, the procedure is different: instead of shucking the animals, ers keep them alive in buckets of saltwater. “When the tourists arrive,” said the owner of one restaurant, who keeps invoices for all her abalone to demonstrate that it is legal, “they charge over to the tanks. They take pictures with the abalone. People get very excited.”On a recent Saturday, some poachers in Hout Bay’s fishing settlement, where Shuhood sold most of his abalone, demonstrated how they prepared the shellfish. In a dusty yard strewn with trash, they lit a fire and heated a three-legged potjie – a traditional cast-iron pot for cooking stews. Across the valley were expensive homes, predominantly owned by white people. The abalone had been harvested the night before by ers at Robben Island. Between three boats, the men said, nearly a tonne had come in. “People here ask the ers to keep a few on the side for them,” one of them said. “Abalone is like a staple food for us.”They had 10 pieces of shucked abalone in two plastic bread packets. The flesh was slimy and pale brown, with grey-green frills. One man scrubbed the pieces clean with a knife before cutting thick slices. Someone else chopped onion and green pepper into the pot, sprinkled in some masala blends and black pepper – the precise recipe was to remain secret, he said – and added the abalone to soften. Beside the fire was a big lobster, also caught illegally the night before. Finally he poured in a bag of cheap seafood mix – mussels, calamari offcuts, shrimp, imitation crab –and shut the lid.While we wait, the men open quarts of beer, roll joints and exchange views on the mollusc they were about to eat.“Seafood is seafood. There’s nothing special about this.”“People didn’t put monetary value on it before.”“Nothing tastes like perlemoen. It’s like you’re eating butter.”“Die geheim is in die sleim.” (The secret’s in the slime.)When the potjie is ready, they serve it in abalone shells lined with paper plates, to stop the sauce dripping through the holes. Someone runs to buy a packet of white bread. Other men arrive, drawn by the smell. “Not anyone can afford this,” one man says, licking his fingers. It happens to be the day of the royal wedding. “Eating for free, I feel like Lady Diana.”Some names have been changed. Poacher: Confessions from the Abalone Underworld by Kimon de Greef and Shuhood Abader is published next month. Kimon de Greef was supported by a grant from the Africa-China Reporting Project, managed by the University of the Witwatersrand.The Chinese have regarded abalone as a delicacy since ancient times. They were a favourite food of Cao Cao, the wily Han dynasty warlord (and villain of the classic novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms), and have been mentioned in histories, poems and cookbooks through the ages. Fresh abalone have traditionally been eaten in coastal regions and are now more widely available, while cooked, dried abalone, especially those dried by specialists in Japan, have the greater social cachet. Tinned abalone are much easier to prepare but regarded as inferior.In the old Sheung Wan district of Hong Kong, dried seafood merchants display jars of perfect abalone, graded by size, their golden, faintly translucent shell muscles surrounded by rough ovals of darker frills. Whole dried abalone are one of the great Cantonese dried seafood delicacies. They are graded according to the number of “heads” that make up a total weight of one catty or 500g: the finest, and most expensive, are two-head abalone at around 250g apiece the greater the number of heads, the smaller the abalone.Laboriously reconstituted and cooked in luxurious stocks and sauces, dried abalone are fabulously expensive and enjoyed for their delicious flavour and intriguing texture. Sometimes they are cooked with other seafood delicacies such as sea cucumber and fish maw. Their most famous proponent is the “Abalone King”, Yeung Koon Yat of Hong Kong’s Forum restaurant, who has been impressing customers (including Deng Xiaoping and Jacques Chirac) with his slow-cooked abalone for more than 40 years.

The 22-year-old actor played the teenage incarnation of the conflicted gay protagonist Chiron in Barry Jenkins’s Moonlight, the tiny-budget art film that became an Oscar-winning emblem of social change in Hollywood. The Los Angeles native has scarcely stopped working since. With some Calvin Klein modelling on the side, he has a host of films lined up, from independent projects to studio blockbusters, beginning with a prominent role opposite Denzel Washington in the shoot-’em-up sequel The Equalizer 2.Was it daunting to work with Denzel Washington?I think every African American actor somewhat looks up to Denzel. Even taking race out of it, he’s one of those icons that you just have to respect. The range of work that he’s been able to do, and been able to succeed in: it’s insane, he’s a master.Is that distinct from your Moonlight family? Or are you building an extended clan?It seems like it’s one growing family. I’ve been lucky to work with some pretty all-around good people, some familiar spirits, the last couple of years. And that’s important, especially when you’re starting out: those connections navigate you through the industry, and just through the world.The Equalizer 2 is obviously a completely different animal from Moonlight: was making the switch to a big studio production disorienting?Not as much as you’d think. I grew up doing theatre, where I was jumping in and out of plays, year round. I was training, and also doing three or four plays a year. So that’s something that I’m just conditioned to do. It’s all really the same process: you’re developing a character. You have to start from the same place, build it up. And sure, what’s around you is different, but that makes it really fun for me. Every project I do, I feel I’m sharpening my tool, that I’m still changing it.We’ll see you next year in Captive State, a big sci-fi thriller, alongside some smaller indies. Is that the balance you’d like to maintain?I try not to think about it too hard. If the script is good and the director is passionate, that’s where I start. I’d say my heart is more in independents, but sometimes these major films come along that are pretty good, you know?You’ve worked mostly with African American film-makers thus far: Antoine Fuqua, Barry Jenkins and Rashid Johnson, among others. Is that a deliberate choice?Yeah, it’s definitely important to me. The sad reality of it is, as black artists in the industry, we still have to work 10 times harder to get our voices out there. So it’s important that we embrace each other, and that we collaborate. I think when everybody is on the same collective team, things get pushed forward in a stronger way.Do you take the public embrace of a film like Moonlight as a positive sign?I think a big part of its success was that it was so real it was something that people needed to see and talk about. So things are moving – not too fast, but moving. These subjects aren’t being swept under the rug. Whether it’s race relations in the industry, whether it’s sexual assault allegations, whatever it be... We’re at a point where people are talking about things, and that’s the first step.And one thing your roles in Moonlight and The Equalizer 2 do, albeit in very different contexts, is touch on the experience of being young and black in America today.Yes, and that’s something I’m looking to do in my work. We need to showcase all different levels of black life, and I’m getting the opportunities to work with great directors and producers who are on the same wavelength as me. It’s my job as an artist and as an actor to use this platform to make people learn and grow, to change their perspectives on how things are in whatever way I can. That’s what I’m supposed to do.Is that responsibility more urgent with Trump in the White House?Oh, yeah. We’re living in such a scary time. It’s all chaos and hurt. But chaos and hurt has always inspired some of the greatest works of art in the world.As a young black man in America, are you feeling that hurt first-hand?What I’m learning, the older I get, is that no matter where you come from, America is going to make you feel like a black man feels, regardless. You can have money, you can have everything you ever wanted, you can be as equal as the next, but you’re still going to feel that pressure. It’s something that America has always been based on: that anxiety we feel as we walk around as black people. Our reality isn’t the same. I want to have hope: in the industry, everybody’s being inclusive, things are changing. But then something happens like the murder of Nia Wilson – in broad daylight, just because she was a black woman. And that’s a slap in the face. It’s hard to trust America, being black in it. But you’ve got to live, you’ve got to do what you’ve got to do. So I’m doing that.Away from acting, you’ve recently done some modelling, and your dad’s a fashion designer. Does that world interest you?It’s just fun, honestly. I’ve always loved clothes, so to wear fresh-off-the-runway stuff and work with respected photographers – that’s pretty cool. As for designing... well, that’s something that’s in the works.The Equalizer 2 is in cinemas now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dd7fac75930f8a4e2ba0a04539ca4fe8ec7eabb/0_176_5301_3181/master/5301.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c684cb5138bbb50b276a3d5d7e40fd1a","title":"the festival film review inbetweeners","story":"Boyish humour enters a field of its own in Iain Morris’s filth-encrusted romp, which works as a spiritual sequel to The InbetweenersExams, virginity loss, lads’ holidays and gap years British writer-director Iain Morris has spent the last 10 years taking the piss out of teenage rites of passage, humiliating four dweeby sixth-formers better known as The Inbetweeners in the process. Morris’s hit sitcom spawned two spinoff films that took its characters on tour: the first, on an all-inclusive trip to Malia, the second, to “find” themselves in Australia. His new film, The Festival, takes on the myths – and the mud – of Glastonbury though no characters cross over from The Inbetweeners universe, the film works as a kind of spiritual sequel.When Nick (Joe Thomas, who played Simon in The Inbetweeners) is unceremoniously dumped by his girlfriend Caitlin (Hannah Tointon) at their university graduation, he vows to spend the summer confined to his bedroom, cry-wanking while surrounded by empty boxes of fried chicken. His best friend, Shane (Hammed Animashaun), a guilelessly optimistic EDM obsessive, convinces him that the best way to get out of his head – and over Caitlin – is to attend a music festival, and so, travelling on children’s tickets (“It’s so much cheaper!”), the pair take a train and pitch a tent in a field that “literally stinks of shit”. Shane hopes they will get to meet “DJ Hammerhead” (I won’t spoil which British comedian takes this role ) and play his idol some of his own tunes (“Wait for the drop – it’s just three more minutes”). Along the way, they pick up Amy (Claudia O’Doherty of the Netflix series Love), a motor-mouthed Aussie equipped with a Tupperware container of “Chafney”, a mysterious, nutrient-packed grey slop that Shane decides is “quite good, actually”. O’Doherty is subtly tragicomic as the friendless festival veteran, playing up her unflappably positive attitude, whether hanging out in the queue for the Portaloos or, better still, in the paramedic’s tent.Drug misuse is a predictable plot point, but the details are perfect: under the influence of MDMA, the otherwise straight-edge Nick falls for a girl dressed as Smurfette (Emma Rigby), on the run because she “stole some fruit from Tame Impala’s yurt”, while Gordy (Theo Barklem-Biggs), the crew’s resident dealer, confuses ketamine for cocaine, snorting five lines then immediately declaring he’d better “put on some Norah Jones and ride this one out”.Indeed, it’s the specificity of the stereotypes that Morris hangs out to dry that make the film so funny. From character archetypes like posh blonde Lucy (Lizzy Connolly), who is constantly introducing herself to Shaun, despite the two having met about 40 times previously, to the names of the acts (“Yung Boner” being my personal favourite), the laughs land because the gags are so very precise.As with Morris’s previous projects, the cringe comedy quotient is high the film’s visceral, squirm-making moments involving an ill-advised nipple piercing and an unsavoury stain on Nick’s graduation gown are unlikely to convert those left unconvinced by this particular brand of boyish humour – and it’s worth noting that perhaps I am predisposed to it, given that The Inbetweeners ran from 2008-10, concurrent with my own time at sixth-form college. Yet these set pieces are used sparingly, with the filth-encrusted minds of young writers Keith Akushie and Joe Parham (who collaborated on the BBC3 sitcom Siblings) drifting towards weirder, funnier scenarios. Flight of the Conchords star Jemaine Clement plays Shane’s overbearing oddball stepfather Robin, who does carpool karaoke to a Crowded House track Shane and Amy encounter a creepy community of druids (“We’re druids, not cannibals!”). The boys perform an inspired, Magic Mike-esque striptease to David Guetta and Akon’s 2009 track Sexy Chick. Some of the film’s reference points feel a little dated I’d have expected more memes and less Mr Brightside, but that’s a minor quibble.The Inbetweeners Movie (2011) took £45m at the box office, becoming – believe it or not – the most successful British comedy of all time. The Festival, I think, is better.It delivers its “lessons” with a light touch, allowing Nick a couple of moments of genuine, relatable pathos (“Why did I think I could be happy?” he laments, after running into Caitlin at the festival), but encouraging the audience to take his self-loathing with a pinch of salt. Robin consoles him, using cyclist Lance Armstrong as an example of a redeemable “problematic fave”. “Yeah, he’s a cheat and a bully, but he’s donated a lot of money to charity, and he’s got a great podcast.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05a1436dd45d8a40bde915ff947263a37805063c/0_804_4733_2841/master/4733.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd1d57f594e1df122e4ba0342a11caaf","title":"grand dishes grandmothers recipes stories","story":"Meet the stars of an award-winning project celebrating the lives and recipes of the true heroes of family cooking“She cooks like no one else I know,” says Anastasia Miari of her grandmother, whose name is also Anastasia Miari (her grandchildren call her Yiayia – the Greek for granny) and who lives by herself in a tiny house in Corfu. “She’s pretty ferocious, but she cooks the most phenomenal food over an open fire, aged 80, and really shows her love for me and the rest of my family through the dishes she puts on the table.”A couple of years ago, as she was trying to cajole recipes out of Yiayia, Miari, a 28-year-old journalist living in London, had a brainwave: “Wouldn’t it be cool to do a book of grandmothers’ recipes and stories?” She mentioned the idea to her university friend, Iska Lupton, a creative director whose relationship with her own grandmother is also bound up with food, and together they created Grand Dishes.The project began to take shape online, with excerpts from their interviews appearing on granddishes, 2018 winner of best blog at the Guild of Food Writers awards (the full versions will run in a book, currently crowdfunding at unbound). “The more people we spoke to about what we were doing,” says Miari, “the more people were like, ‘I’ve got a granny you need to interview.’”“Initially we’d think, oh, we’d better check if this one’s got a good story,” says Lupton. “Then we realised, anyone who’s lived beyond 70 has so many stories to tell. As long as they’ve got a recipe of their own to share, we just know the stories will come.”I grew up in Johannesburg and started a family there. Then, at 30, I said to my husband, “It’s time to go” – I knew that South Africa was not right for my children – so we packed everything up and started from scratch in London.Life was very busy in England. I worked with Revlon for 20 years, doing promotions all over the country, so cooking for a hungry family had to be fast. If I made a steak, I’d serve it with onions, tomato sauce and Worcestershire sauce, and call it a monkey gland steak. That was their favourite. I could make a very nice dinner within 10 minutes.Since I was a young girl I have watched what I eat, and I have, I think, the perfect body for my age. I see that I have a certain amount of protein, vegetables and fruit. I make a smoothie every day, with five or six different fruits. And I try not to snack, especially after dinner. I never weigh myself – I know by my clothes if I’m putting on weight – and my metabolism seems to have improved with age. I can eat more today than when I was a youngster.I’ve had three men in my life. Two of them could cook. My husband – we were married for 37 years – used to help from time to time. The next one was an Englishman and he was very English: he used to just sit at the table and wait to be served. The last one, an American, was a rocket scientist. We’ve been together 14 years. He’s 91 now and in a home. I still go over to visit, but mostly I’m on my own here in London. I’ll be 89 in a week’s time and I’m fit as a fiddle. I do have cancer: chronic leukaemia. But I just get on with my life. My grandchildren – I’ve got two in London and one in America – love to come around and eat at my place they’re mad about my chicken curry and rice. Food is important, it’s like fuel to a car, but we shouldn’t be obsessed about it. When my two boys were very young, they would ask me what we were going to have for dinner. I never said: “We’re going to have pasta.” I’d say: “We’re going to have food.” As long as I put food on the table, that’s the important thing, not the choice. We get so much, we should be happy with what we have. Why make it complicated? If you can’t eat fish today, eat chicken, or eat lentils.As a child in Germany, I used to watch my mother and grandmother cooking and eventually they allowed me to help. We would have typically Bavarian dishes, such as knödel, which is a sort of dumpling. They’re quite a lot of trouble to prepare: you have to grate raw potatoes and mix them with very liquid mashed potatoes, and having taken them all apart, you put them together again. I thought this was great fun.One day in 1938, when I was 10, my mother picked me up from school. She drove straight to the nearest airport, parked the car, left the key in it and then booked a flight, which we boarded that afternoon. I never learned exactly what sparked that decision but it saved our lives –my father was Jewish.In England, I was desperately keen to be completely English. When I went walking through town with my mum, I’d always try to stop her talking so noisily. She’d let the cat out of the bag, of course, and people would know we were foreign. We really weren’t welcome anywhere.When I started cooking for myself, as a student at the Royal College of Music, it was mostly English food. But I suppose it was more exciting to cook the old German recipes. My music studies were supposed to be taken all the way, but I married, and children came along, and there wasn’t time. These days I just adore a fried egg on spinach. My grandchildren love what they call my “granny carrots”. You chop your carrots into little diced things and cook them in butter with fried onions and maybe a few drops of lemon juice, then masses of parsley at the end. So they were very flavoursome.I don’t take much pleasure in cooking these days. I make a mess in the kitchen. Now I’m 90, that’s not really surprising, is it?In my time, we were told you had to go to your in-laws so you could learn how to cook. But my mother was a very good cook, so I learned everything from her first. Then I got married and my mother-in-law was a very good cook as well. So I learned from both ladies, and I’m still interested in cooking.We left Tanzania for England 45 years ago. My children and my husband settled very quickly but I didn’t settle for two years. I was all the time crying because I missed my family. But I got a very good job with Corah \u0026amp Sons, a Jewish company that made clothes for Marks \u0026amp Spencer. It was good pay, good people, everything good, so eventually I settled. We’ve been in Leicester 45 years and now it’s my home, I don’t want to go anywhere.Even when I was working, I had time to cook. My husband can do only beans on toast, but he helps a lot with housework. My children were very good eaters, I never had any problem. I like making savouries for them – I always make my own Bombay mix. Up till now at least: I don’t know in 12 months if I’ll be able to do it or not, because of my age.My daughter’s daughter and my son’s two daughters, they all love cooking, but their way is not my way. My way is completely old-style. They love my proper curries – lentil curry, a curry I make with yogurt. They really love my food. Sometimes they ring me and say: “Grandma, make this thing for us.”Food is a big chunk of my life. My husband had three children from his previous marriage and I had three with him, so I ended up with six children and I had to cater for all of them. Once or twice I had to say: “Come on, I don’t dish up poison, you eat what I give you.” Otherwise, they ate everything.My husband didn’t do any cooking, he was busy working. He went out early and I always had a meal waiting when he came in. I never resented it. I can hardly stop myself now – I’ve made coconut tartlets this morning. The children all had their little jobs: one cleared the table, one filled the dishwasher and one dried up. My husband didn’t help, but he was wonderful and loving. I had a very happy marriage.I still cook every day because I’ve got an arrangement with a widower, who comes to eat at six and goes at seven. I used to cook for a chap who worked for my husband, but he died suddenly, so I rang up John and said: “Pat’s gone, I’ll cook for you.” So he comes up, has a meal with me, and pays for it by taking me to the cinema. I did beef carbonnade two weeks ago and he’d never heard of it. But he eats it all. It’s like the dog’s licked the plate in the end.My dinners are not complete without a pudding. I do one every single day and try to vary them as much as possible. But I don’t have a very sweet tooth. I had a road accident many years ago and they put me on medication which I think affected my taste buds, as well as damaging my nervous system, because I’m not into the cakes like I used to be. I do everything myself – jams, chutneys – I don’t buy anything at all, never have done since my eldest child was born in 1968. I grow all my own vegetables as well, chemical-free. I’ve got a large greenhouse, and guess what I do, I still bottle my tomatoes. You use them as you would tinned tomatoes. I haven’t bought a loaf of bread in 50 years.When I was younger, I was more interested in making things – building and fixing – than cooking. But when my son Daniel was at university, I started a small coffee shop in Woolwich, south-east London. We were serving British things: jacket potato, coronation chicken, tuna mayo. When that didn’t work out, we decided as a family to change it to an Eritrean restaurant called Blue Nile.All the recipes were chosen by the family, based on food I cooked at home. The kitcha fit-fit (pitta bread fried in spiced butter and Eritrean spices served with yogurt) is Daniel’s favourite, I used to make it on a Sunday for breakfast. Habte, my husband, likes ful (warm broad bean stew served with a boiled egg). My favourite is hamli (spinach cooked with garlic, chilli and olive oil). It reminds me of Eritrea, where I grew up – my grandmother would make it if we came to visit.I never, ever cook from recipe books, I just cook. And I get pleasure from cooking – when I look at someone enjoying my food, that’s the best. My husband doesn’t do much in the kitchen, although he managed to cook bolognese sauce when I broke my leg. It impressed me very much, but afterwards he said: “Don’t push your luck.” He also makes scrambled eggs now and then – the boys call it Dad’s Famous Scrambled Egg – and that’s fine by me.Learning to cook happens day by day. You try something and think, um, this one doesn’t look or taste nice, so you adjust it. Also when the customers come, I always see whether they’re eating it or not. I ask them: “Is that OK? Do you want another one?” That’s good, because it helps you get better.Our first grandchild, Sami, is now two and our second, Zoe, was born last month. It’s a very exciting time for us.

As United manager he features in Amazon’s behind-the-scenes docu‑series far more than might be expected in what is purportedly a documentary about City’s title-winning season there is even footage of him in his Chelsea days discussing his reasons for moving out Kevin De Bruyne and the narration rarely misses an opportunity to adopt a sneering tone towards Mourinho and his players.“I am in the movie so much I think I could ask for some royalties,” Mourinho said. “Perhaps without me it would not sell as much, I don’t know, but if City send me one of the shirts they had in the tunnel when we played there last, the ones that were saying: ‘We did it on derby day,’ then I will give up about the royalties.”That is a reference to the Manchester derby last April, when City were poised to clinch the title with a win against United at the Etihad, only to surrender a two-goal lead and lose the game 3-2 when Paul Pogba inspired a fightback. Had City taken the points they would have conducted their celebrations wearing specially printed T-shirts making reference to the fact that they had won the title by beating their greatest rivals, or so Mourinho remains convinced.He maintains he has not seen City’s documentary and probably has no intention of watching it in its entirety, though he has evidently been briefed that it contains a certain amount of gloating at United’s expense.Pogba would go on to win the World Cup with France in the summer, then fuel speculation over his relationship with his club manager by indicating he was being forbidden to speak freely about United, though according to Mourinho the pair have been getting on fine and the manager “couldn’t be happier” about his stand-in captain’s work and professional attitude.The same seems to apply to David de Gea, who did not have such a successful World Cup, though Mourinho claims his goalkeeper was unfairly singled out for criticism because he plays for United. “David played four matches in the World Cup and he made one mistake,” Mourinho said.\u0026nbsp“That was in the early game against Portugal and his team didn’t even lose. It was not the most costly mistake because Spain went on to equalise, and then they topped their group. They drew against Russia in\u0026nbspthe fourth game and lost on\u0026nbsppenalties.“So in around 400 minutes of open play David made one mistake and his team was not even punished for that mistake. All the other guys in the team were protected from criticism because they play for Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atlético Madrid, etc. The poor guy who plays for Manchester United was the one the press chose to destroy, but David is stronger than that. He knew perfectly well he was not\u0026nbspresponsible for Spain being knocked out, he came back normal and by the time we were in the United States he was working as hard as\u0026nbspever.”De Gea’s much-anticipated move back to Spain appears to be off for the time being, with Thibaut Courtois presumably filling Real Madrid’s needs for the foreseeable future, though the player’s market value must have risen after a summer when first Liverpool and then Chelsea paid world record sums for new goalkeepers, with the latter paying Athletic Bilbao £71m for the 23-year-old Kepa Arrizabalaga.Then again, Mourinho thinks not. “The price of De Gea in today’s market is zero,” the United manager said. “He is a Manchester United player, he will sign a new contract as soon as possible, he likes it here and we love him. He wants to stay and we want him to stay, so he is not in the market. And when a player is not in the market his value is zero.”Mourinho does not attempt to deny that there was interest from Madrid, or that at various times intermediaries were agitating for a move, but says the situation has been handled professionally and amicably. “The agent didn’t create a war to try and achieve his objectives, and I must thank him for that,” the Portuguese said.“He respected the club and the player, and the player was always happy to stay, so credit to all three parties.”At just 27, De Gea now finds himself older than most of the iniduals who are changing clubs for vast sums elsewhere in the Premier League, though Mourinho has no worries on that score.“I wouldn’t swap him for anyone,” he said. “My goalkeeper is always the best in the world, if you understand what I mean. I used to say that when I was coaching União Leiria, a small club in Portugal. I don’t mean to be disrespectful or arrogant and imply that Courtois or Manuel Neuer is not good. There are so many good goalkeepers out there but I am happy with mine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0e0271d57ae9456dc90b056a259c91cc7e8ec94/0_301_5352_3211/master/5352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=485c7a6439221cb639cf647d021d7a0e","title":"super cup reaction and celtics champions league exit football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden and co on Atlético’s win over Madrid, European woe for Celtic and Bristol Rovers’ dubious half-time entertainmentRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

The reigning champions Chelsea started the 2010-11 season with five straight wins and 21 goals before going completely off the rails, and something similar happened to Pep Guardiola in his first season at Maine Road. But this fashion-conscious bald man is relentless once he takes control of a domestic league, and City may well give the other 19 Premier League teams a nine-month course in Futility Studies.Even the absence of Kevin De Bruyne feels like an irritation rather than a serious problem, and it’s hard to see anything other than a City win at home to Huddersfield this afternoon.

In order to bond with Pippin the fawn (Hepburn called her Ip), she was encouraged to care for her, feeding her milk from a baby bottle. “I don’t have any children of my own,” she told a reporter on set, “but I’m learning a lot from Ip.” She took the deer to parties, and slept in bed with her.In his book Remembering Audrey, the photographer Bob Willoughby, who followed Hepburn for years, including on this trip to the supermarket, wrote: “Beverly Hills habitués are fairly blasé about what they see, but Audrey being followed around town by this lovely creature stopped everyone in their tracks.” When the film wrapped, she was devastated to give the fawn back a year later she had a miscarriage. To try and lift her out of depression, her husband tracked down Ip, then, much to the disappointment of her Yorkshire terrier Mr Famous, took her in as a pet. And then she had a baby.It was her second son, Luca Dotti, who wrote Audrey at Home, a cookbook that detailed her favourite recipes, many of which she’d collected as cardboard recipe tabs from Elle magazine. “Her absolute favourite,” Dotti told People magazine, “was spaghetti with tomato sauce. She could live on that alone.” Every morning around 4am, she’d eat a madeleine for breakfast, and every evening she’d eat chocolate, which she believed, “banished sadness”.Growing up in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam, Hepburn had seen people die of starvation. She came close herself, surviving by eating nettles and tulip bulbs, and drinking water to fill her stomach. She told her son about a moment towards the end of the war, when a soldier approached her with the gift of seven chocolate bars, which she ate all at once. For her, “That moment remained the most vivid memory of the joy of liberation.”Despite rumours of eating disorders, food was the key, her son insists, to her pleasure, and comfort. On one of their last trips together, a holiday in Jamaica, they were shocked at the weight of her smallest case. Inside, she had packed only spaghetti."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9912f251430256dcaf59d65393aa8bb78384b62b/104_483_3187_1912/master/3187.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92a6482f3a52af2430076a302a450818","title":"dating agencies lets be honest about hard it is to find a partner teresa burki","story":"The case of Tereza Burki and an elite dating agency was a victory for all who have been shamed in their quest for loveMeat Loaf would do anything for love, and so would Tereza Burki – or, at least, she would spend £12,600 trying to find it.That’s how much Burki, 47, paid a dating agency in 2013 to introduce her to the man of her dreams. But last week she got her money back, plus £500 as compensation for distress, when a judge ruled that the agency, Seventy Thirty, had misled her by promising to find a partner who would fulfil her requirements – although it had only about 100 candidates. A fishmonger can’t charge you for salmon if they haven’t caught any now there’s a legal precedent that says a dating agency can’t charge you for a husband if there aren’t actually any fish in their sea.“Her requirements were not modest,” the judge wrote in his ruling. But nonetheless, the agency did not deliver on its promise. Burki asked to meet a wealthy man who would offer sophistication and an interest in world travel, and who wanted to have children. The agency took her on as a client but didn’t mention how many candidates it had to choose from 100 was hardly a surfeit when each was to be judged against Burki’s criteria – even before consideration of whether they watched the same things on Netflix.Some might say that Burki’s disappointment was unjustified, that you can’t always get what you want. But those are probably people who have been in relationships for years.For those of us who have spent a long time being single – I was, from my early 20s to mid-30s – Burki’s victory is a small, albeit highly privileged, strike on behalf of all of us who have ever been made to feel ashamed because we were looking for love.While dating agencies such as Seventy Thirty exist to serve an especially rarefied echelon, single people are constantly targeted by businesses that at once remind them of their insecurities and promise to help them find true love. From deodorant sprays to plastic surgery, gym subscriptions to diet foods, products abound that suggest that there is something intrinsically unlovable about us that can be mended if you throw money at the problem.Though the path between, say, a low-fat yogurt and an engagement ring may be slightly more convoluted than the connection between a professional matchmaker and a marriage, both employ narratives that offer single people – especially heterosexual women – the promise of a solution to one of life’s most unsolvable challenges. That women who date men are the particular targets of agencies with questionable ethics is not insignificant.In a heteronormative culture that values committed, monogamous relationships above all else, heterosexual people are under pressure to be coupled, but also to make no effort to be coupled.When single, we are told by people in the safety and comfort of longterm relationships that “you’ll meet someone when you least expect it”, and we’re also told that “you’re trying too hard” if we express our feelings of loneliness, or that we’d like to meet someone or ask someone else for help meeting someone – “all of my single friends are awful” is the inevitable response. We are led to believe that expressing a want for love – the most human of desires – makes us less lovable. But we are also reminded that our biological clocks are ticking: that the passage of time rapidly decreases our value in the romantic marketplace.While single men who date women also receive similar useless advice – and many also know well the pain of unwanted solitude and disconnection – their timeline for commitment is perceived to be longer, no doubt in large part because of the realities of reproduction.Burki’s top criterion for a new partner was for him to be someone who would have a child with her. For Seventy Thirty to have promised to provide this despite its low number of real candidates was far from ethical – not unlike the practices of private fertility clinics that provide endless “top-up” treatments and services, despite these treatments’ lack of proven efficacy.Whether promising love in the form of partnerships or parenthood, both of these business strategies may have elements of well-meaning, but they’re ultimately rooted in capitalist enthusiasm to wring money from women’s pain and shame.While few of us have Burki’s financial resources to go out and find what we’re looking for in a partner, that doesn’t mean she should be judged for making an effort. I met my husband on Tinder when I was 35, which was much cheaper. But if you’re not going to go for a formal arranged marriage, there are few definitive routes to love, marriage and family.Who are any of us to judge another’s attempts? I would not recommend Tinder as a source of husbands any more than I would recommend marrying someone you meet on a bus, or your next-door neighbour, or someone who slides into your Twitter DMs. This is a hard truth to swallow when you’re lonely, and, what’s more, when you’re led to believe that any expressions of that loneliness will serve to make you less likely to solve that problem.Yet greater honesty about how hard it is to find love, and greater openness about how much we want it, will not just help us to go about seeking relationships in better faith, but also undermine businesses that target the softest parts of our hearts to make a buck."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a0cb642422c7ec232a4b130a09e233920449a3f/520_1004_4681_2808/master/4681.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cb1871cccdd90e5716cf954236961c4","title":"taste test chips and dips supermarket snacks vegetable crisps salsa guacamole","story":"Cookery writer Sabrina Ghayour tastes and rates supermarket snacksMy happy place.

Overlooked by Tate St Ives and facing the Atlantic ocean, the promenade is heaving with teenage surfers and families marked out by striped windbreakers and beach towels crumpled across the sand.“I don’t mind people having holidays, I’m very pleased for them, I don’t blame them for coming here,” she says, sitting on a picnic bench with her sister-in-law, Jo Burroughs, taking refuge from the bustle. “It is a very beautiful part of the country,” agrees Burroughs. “There’s no doubt about it, you’d go a long way to find beaches like this.”Kinsey used to run her own seaside hotel in Penzance, one of a kind that has struggled to exist while an industry of holiday lets in apartments and cottages has boomed. She is cheerfully no-nonsense about the shift in tourism trends – her former hotel is now a care home – since she moved to Cornwall from Cheshire 45 years ago, in which time the county has become the UK’s top domestic holiday destination.She has followed the saga of second-home owners buying up the coast’s prettiest towns over the last few decades, and of prices rocketing far out of reach of her children and grandchildren. “I think it’s the councils and the planning people that have allowed it to happen and they’re to blame,” she says. “They’re ruining St Ives, it’s losing character.”The town has long been at the centre of debate on the impact of both tourism and moneyed Brits. Residents voted against any more new homes being built for second-home owners in a 2016 referendum.While the shortage of affordable and social housing has reached crisis point across the UK, towns and villages that have become holiday-home hotspots report myriad associated problems: a staggering proportion of the local housing stock becomes out of reach for full-time residents infrastructure can be ill-equipped to cope with high tourist traffic in peak periods which is flipped, off-season, by the reality of bleakly empty ghost towns where homes remain empty and businesses struggle to adjust.Campaigners say that communities are eroded by the wild imbalance and that owners of second homes must contribute much more – beginning with paying council tax to help develop more social housing, a matter the government is being urgently lobbied to review.Andrew Mitchell, a cabinet member on the housing and planning committees at St Ives town council, is aghast. “I can only imagine the impact that has on a family if you’re trying to get children settled in school and every six months you’re having to try to find somewhere to live.”Walking through the town, he points out rows and rows of streets dominated by holiday lets. “It’s human nature to look through rose-tinted glasses and say, ‘it used to be better back then’.“People are reluctant to change, but change has to happen and I think we mix the two quite well in St Ives.” The town is packed with tourists. “People are having a good time on holiday,” he says. “Locals are working, making their money.”In one hillside campsite north of Padstow, a town with mixed feelings towards its resident celebrity chefs Rick Stein and Paul Ainsworth, a woman in her twenties meets me at the entrance of her static caravan. Muddy boots line the steps and her dog rests in a floppy heap by the door. “There are some people that do this,” she gestures to her temporary summer digs, “but this is my parents’ business, so I don’t want to go into it too much.” She explains that she normally lives in a stone cottage on the grounds which is “obviously let out in the summer”.Some Cornish teachers rent out their homes in the summer season to boost their income while they holiday in a camper van abroad for six weeks one woman spends the summer going from one festival to another doing henna tattoos. The disparity between average income (about £17,300) and average house prices in Cornwall (about £228,000) is the highest in the UK outside London, making it the second most expensive place to buy a home – or, as has often been the case, a second home – outside the capital.The hotel is a key feature of the village, on one of the most picturesque stretches of English coastline. On the one hand, its rows of pretty fisherman’s cottages and craft shops make it a rural holiday idyll for thousands of tourists every year. On the other, burst pipes have been leaking sewage into the harbour and flooding the streets, leaving its few hundred permanent residents to clean up the mess caused by the heavy strain of holidaymakers. Vanhinsbergh had been at a meeting the night before “with assorted bodies” working to fix it. “It was kind of a hoo-ha but they’ve semi-sorted it.”The trouble is that “homes that were previously single or double occupancy, where the older owners have passed away, have been sold and redone as second homes or holiday lets and have eight to 10 people in them at any one time now,” says Derek Thomas, the Tory MP for West Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly.He appreciates that sewage problems are not the sort of thing a campaign to lobby government might be built on. But Thomas, sitting in the foyer of his constituency office above the Wharfside shopping centre in Penzance, is clear that it’s very much part of a wider problem blighting the lives of locals: the issue of second-home owners and holiday-let holders in Cornish villages and towns where the infrastructure simply cannot cope – and where they are not helping to pay for local services.The small business rate relief was introduced by the coalition government five years ago as a way to help rural traders – say, the last shop or pub in the village – survive. That second-home owners or property investors have been able to legally exploit this tax loophole, saving up to £12,000 a year, has become a sore point for local people when council tax bills have been rising.In towns such as Sheringham, the parish council might apply for funding from the district council to run lunch clubs for the elderly, play parks and village halls to keep rural communities alive, but dwindling numbers of local volunteers in the second-home hotspots has allowed basic services to wither where they are needed most.Up the road in Blakeney, two new homes with sea views are on the market for £1.3m and £995,000. According to the local agent, “most viewings at this time of year are speculative by couples on holiday here, but that may be looking to maybe buy in three to four years’ time.”In Padstow, which has registered the highest number of sales to second-home owners in Cornwall in the last year, local estate agent Gail Thomas is diplomatic. Her typical buyer won’t be local, she says, but will own a property in the area for a handful of years and then trade up. “Yes, the restaurants are expensive for locals, but we don’t have to go out here, there are normal things to do at normal prices.”To Barry Hall, managing director of letting agent St Ives Holidays, which has about 200 properties on its books, the animosity towards his clients is ill-founded. “Generally, the owners are people who holiday here for years, love the place and when they come into some money they think: ‘Oh, I’m going to own a property here so I can make a thousand pounds a week!’”He laughs. “We employ hundreds of local people to clean and maintain the holiday homes.”Local fury that the council collects rubbish from houses not paying council tax is, he believes, somewhat misguided. “We employ a man to go around collecting all the rubbish. You can’t have visitors coming in to the last visitor’s dirty rubbish, so we have had to deal with it privately for years.”“You can’t feel sorry for the council though,” says a local taxi driver who doesn’t want to be named. “The way they waste money is staggering.” He drives us through Bodmin, pointing out an imposing, faintly ugly building clad in gloomy grey.“Cornwall council built themselves those new offices in the middle of a recession and went horrendously over budget. It’s huge, they can’t fill it. The whole floor is laid in slate, the walls have copper and tin panels because of Cornwall’s heritage and that outside isn’t concrete, you know – it’s clad in granite tiles. And it’s all our money.”Most of his customers are the wealthiest second home-owners in Rock and Trebetherick. “I’m being selfish because I’m making good money out of them, running them up and down,” he says. “But if somebody knocks it locally, ask what their sons or daughters do and it will be, ‘oh they work at such and such restaurant or my son’s a head chef.’”There is a whole industry of workers, he says, like him – cleaners, gardeners, electricians, plumbers, the service trade – that relies on Cornwall’s popularity. That the county remains one of the poorest in the country doesn’t bother him.For Pam Kinsey, it isn’t just the pace of change she is uncomfortable with, it’s the unthinking greed. “I love the beach, I love the people and I have a good social life. But these ridiculous prices and everything being developed into apartments with no consideration of how narrow the roads are ...” She laughs. “I pay my tax – at the very least they should!”In coastal areas many second homes are now being registered as holiday accommodation, enabling them to avoid council tax or business rates by claiming rate relief.In order for a second home to qualify, it must be advertised as being available to let – although there is no actual requirement for this to happen – for at least 140 days of the year.In Southwold, campaigner and now town councillor David Beavan found that 263 second homes being offered as holiday lets had claimed rate relief in 2017, out of a total of 354 small businesses in the town. The total amount of rate relief for Southwold’s second homes totalled more than £550,000, he said.According to St Ives MP Derek Thomas, some 8,808 houses in Cornwall are registered as small businesses, of which 6,650 pay no council tax or business rates, as they claim small business rate relief.• This article was amended on 19 August 2018 to clarify the reference to rubbish collection in St Ives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f36af8bfcf2322e9165b18a5dcb4d0f9d215d2c0/0_911_2334_1400/master/2334.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65d1dc819424435511be2799def970a8","title":"labour suspends ex mp","story":"Jim Sheridan accused Jewish community of colluding with ‘Blairite plotters’Labour has suspended a former MP who accused the Jewish community of colluding with “Blairite plotters” to damage the party, as a poll for the Observer found that more than a third of voters believe that the party is prejudiced against British Jews.Jim Sheridan, MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire North until 2015, was suspended after apparently writing in a Facebook post that has since been removed: “For all my adult life I have had the utmost respect and empathy for the Jewish community and their historic suffering. No longer, due to what they and their Blairite plotters are doing to my party and the long-suffering people of Britain who need a radical Labour government.”Labour said it could not comment on inidual cases, but that complaints of antisemitism were “fully investigated”.Corbyn’s team has been frustrated by the row over its handling of allegations of antisemitism in the party, which has prevented them from spending the summer developing a programme for government.Corbyn’s presence at a gathering in a Tunis cemetery in 2014, at which a wreath was laid at the graves of figures connected to the Black September group, was a source of controversy running throughout last week. The group conducted the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre, in which 11 Israeli athletes were killed.Corbyn has said that he was present but not involved in the wreath-laying. He said that he was at the gathering to commemorate the victims of the 1985 Israeli airstrike on Palestinian Liberation Organisation offices in Tunis. The row followed criticism of Labour for refusing to adopt the full definition and examples of antisemitism as set out by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.Some of Corbyn’s closest allies, including the Unite union boss Len McCluskey, have urged the party to adopt the full definition. It is now preparing to do so, but wants to ensure legitimate criticism of Israel is not curtailed.A survey by Deltapoll published in April suggested that half of the electorate believed there were at least pockets of antisemitism in Labour. That poll was carried out shortly after a demonstration outside parliament against antisemitism within the party.

Given how hard they are to tell apart, they will be a television commentator’s nightmare. But based on how well they have performed together in the past, the combination could create major problems for a strong field that includes three previous winners.Matt White, their directeur sportif at the Mitchelton-Scott squad, said the plan is for Simon – who has been rested since the Giro d’Italia – to lead the team, with Adam in support. The decision to field Adam alongside Simon was taken late in the day after the former’s attempt to finish on the podium of the Tour de France fell flat. After the Vuelta it is likely that both riders will target the world road race championships in Innsbruck, subject to selection.The pair rode the 2015 Tour de France together but that was in the period before they were targeting high placings overall. Since then they have been largely raced apart, except for last year’s Vuelta, where they made little impact, with Adam finishing 34th and Simon 44th.“They’ve been on different trajectories, sometimes one develops faster than the other,” says White, who has looked after the pair since they turned professional in 2014. “There’s always been one in front of the other over the last few years. Adam achieved success more quickly – how many guys win a Classic and finish fourth in the Tour aged 23? – while Simon was more of a grafter. It took him longer to develop but he’s had an incredible year.”Simon Yates’s 2018 will be remembered mostly for the Giro d’Italia, where he wore the pink leader’s jersey for 13 days and won three stages before blowing up spectacularly on the penultimate mountain stage. But he also came within an ace of winning Paris-Nice, where he took the toughest stage, and he won the final stage of the Volta a Catalunya.“The Giro was a big step up for him,” reflects White. “He was clearly the best climber there, totally dominated the mountain stages across the board but paid the price in the end. It was a big confidence boost for him. He was tired afterwards – he went deeper than in all his career so far.“We will ride the Vuelta a bit differently – it’s late in the year, it’s the second Grand Tour of his season – and the Giro wasn’t actually all that long ago. The objective is to put together a solid three weeks and finish strong because that’s an area he can improve on.”White concedes that Mitchelton may have made an error in permitting Yates to race so hard so early in the Giro d’Italia, as he may have paid the price in the final few days. “It wasn’t a matter of support. We were in total control for 17 days. He was never alone. Yes, we could have pulled him back a couple of times but we had a plan to take on Chris Froome whenever we could – we could have adjusted that a bit.“He’d never had a lead in a Grand Tour before. He was in the best form of his life perhaps we got a bit carried away but he learned what his limits are. You can learn from that experience of pushing too hard.”Adam Yates goes into the Vuelta in a different position, having cracked in the Alps at the Tour de France and never recovered. White puts that down in part to the loss of a month’s training after he broke his pelvis at the Volta a Catalunya in late March. “He didn’t have ideal preparation but those were the cards we were dealt,” White says. “At the Tour it was a combination of things. He made a mistake with his hydration one day and paid for it but the next day was Alpe d’Huez.”The pair will race in Spain with one eye on the world championships at the end of September. They are far from alone in this. Vincenzo Nibali has made no secret of the fact he is targeting Innsbruck, which will include perhaps the steepest climb in a world championship in recent memory.First comes the Vuelta, however, which includes eight summit finishes, with stages 13 to 15 through the Asturian mountains looking particularly challenging, as does the penultimate stage through Andorra. Apart from an 8km prologue this coming Saturday, there is only one time trial and that is relatively short at 32km.The field includes former winners in Fabio Aru, Nibali and Nairo Quintana. Richie Porte and Rigoberto Urán also make their comebacks after crashing out of the Tour de France. All of them have at least one thing in common: they are looking to salvage something from the season after falling short in the Giro or the Tour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7fab51fe45a06bfea86cab2a2e18134e86645c3/0_78_3857_2315/master/3857.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4789b10c818870d7cb4b3e11c36521cf","title":"england v india third test day two live","story":"Pot Pouri. Let’s work through some correspondence. To begin, Brian Withington. “A feature of this series TV coverage has been ongoing criticism of the positioning of the slip cordon of both teams. Sir Ian Boredom has of course opined regularly on the subject, but respected Sky observers such as messrs. Hussain, Holding and Sangakkara have also piled in. Surely in this era of extensive analysis someone has come up with a well researched algorithm for optimising spacing that favours the tighter stagger?”Whatever happened to extending arms and touching fingers to determine how far away the slips stand from each other? Simpler times.“Talking of countries (Spain) which have missed the boat cricket-wise you might be interested to know about the version of cricket we have in Brazil,” emails Tom Ashton. “Very popular in country towns amoung children but imagine if Brazil has stayed the course. Would have been nice to watch a test match in Rio.”I’d be the first to sign up to cover that. As it happens, I complete the set (with the exception of Pakistan and Afghanistan) in October when Australia plays in the UAE.Robert Wilson is with us from Paris on the topic of Spanish cricket. “The question is, of course, not how popular it is there but how good would they be if they played it,” he begins. “It’s cricket’s permanent heartbreak, that thought. I often think about here in France (current Olympic Silver Medal holders in cricket). Best untutored kid I ever saw was a sporty French 12 year who, despite my approximate French and some dire Irish weather, picked up a formally perfect side-on, high-arm quick’s action in about ten minutes. Ha had that natural sportsman’s instinctive sympathy for the unchanging physics of all that is bat and ball. Went on to play hockey for the French under 16s. Tragedy is, he was clearly better at cricket.”Usain Bolt, you may have seen, is trying to start his professional football career in New South Wales. For mine, I wish he tried to play cricket for the state instead. That’ll get the punters back to the Sheffield Shield. “Never mind the Spanish,” says John Barns. “I’ll never forget my very sporty Head Teacher Mr Reese back in Gloucestershire in 1986 informing us that in “50 years China will beat England in a test match” a shocking thought. I think the central theme of his assembly was globalisation but suffice to say I’ve not seen a sniff of a Chinese cricket team to even play such a fixture yet alone one to threaten the odds. Pah, 18 years to go Mr Reese, you were chuntering out of your proverbial that’ll show you for all my detentions.”My colleague, Tim Wigmore, has a number of thoughts on cricket in China. I’ll ask him to link me a piece on the topic. In short, my understanding is that Mr Reese might not be completely off the mark with some decent progress made there in the last decade or so. “A collective statsgasmic research task,” emails Tom Bowtell. Sounds like perfect OBO content to me. “Jimmy Anderson has taken his last 200 Test wickets at 20.30. I’m wondering where that puts him in terms of the cheapest run of 200+ wickets within a career. To get us started, between 19th June 1984 and 26th April 1989, Malcolm Marshall took 212 at 18.07 (https:bit.ly2Mm3PAP) So Jimmy isn’t number 1 - but maybe number 1 for England?”We’re about five minutes from the resumption, can anyone work it out before then?In case you missed it. India resumed at 307-6 having lost a wicket with the final delivery of day one. 30 minutes were lost to rain before they got on but when they did, England carried on where they left off with the second new ball, Pant and Ashwin bowled by Broad before Anderson cleaned up Shami and Bumrah in consecutive balls. The visitors were dismisse for 329 and Jimmy is on a hat-trick in the second dig.With 40 minutes to bat before lunch, England went at better than a run a minute without loss. Jennings was the less convincing of the two in the opening exchanges before getting into his stride in the quarter hour before lunch. Bumrah was the man most likely to make an incision but it wasn’t to be. An opportunity missed for India.I’m going to grab a quick bite before returning to your emails. If you can’t get enough of our Vic Marks on TMS this week, here is an extended interview that Geoff Lemon and I did with him about his life in the game on our  Ashes pod last December.9th over: England 46-0 (Cook 21, Jennings 20) Bumrah is swung around to bowl the final over, replacing Shami and beats Cook first up outside the off-stump with a good’un. In fact, the opener may have just pulled inside the line. Good cricket from all invovled. Cook continues his positive start, pushing into the 20s before the break with a pair of clips through midwicket, the first worth two the next three. That’s his happy place. Jennings leaves the final ball of the session and that is lunch. A 90-minute session where it all went right for the home side.8th over: England 41-0 (Cook 16, Jennings 20) Ashwin on for one over before lunch, delivering to Cook. That stoush from Edgbaston didn’t have much of a chance to evolve at Lord’s with the opener out before the tweaker was used, from memory. So this should be good. Not this time around though, Cook taking the one on offer to mid-off first ball. Jennings does well defending from the crease, tucking a couple to midwicket when the spinner lands too straight. The tourists will get one more in before they lunch. 7th over: England 38-0 (Cook 15, Jennings 18) 38 runs in seven overs after ripping through the tail with 422 earlier - a great morning for the hosts. Jennings is looking more comfortable after the driven boundary in Shami’s previous set, pushing two to begin then steering another four behind point. It’s described as an edge on the radio but I reckon he was in control. He deflects a couple more in that direction to finish. Solid.6th over: England 30-0 (Cook 15, Jennings 10) Luuurvely off-drive from Ali Ali Cook no need to run for that. Bumrah is really bending his back to try and prompt a hurried stroke, which might explain why he overstepped with what would have been his final delivery. “England will be delighted with this,” says Swann of the start in conditions where the Indian seamers should be getting busy with at least one early scalp.“It’s looking like anything over 250 today would be a bonus for England,” writes Brian Withington. “Indeed, avoiding the follow on may not be a given. Time for Cook to grind like he’s never ground before - especially at this ground.” Bit early for that kind of pessimism, isn’t it? I’ll backing Cook in on the evidence of the last couple of overs.5th over: England 25-0 (Cook 11, Jennings 10) Much better, Cook putting away a short delivery through cover point with ease. Shami hits back with one that darts off the seam and finds the veteran’s inside edge, not missing his stumps by far. Jennings’ turn and it is a second boundary out to cover, this time driven along the carpet with confidence. That’ll do the junior partner the world of good with 15 minutes to lunch.  “I have lived in Spain for thirteen summers and not seen so much as a sightscreen,” Justin Horton tweeted at Tim. “Football lasts ninety minutes: the locals here couldn’t be attracted by a game taking several days to play, because, especially in summer, they had to work.”4th over: England 16-0 (Cook 6, Jennings 6) Bumrah getting the ball through at good pace. He’s maintaining a straight line to Cook, forced to use his bat early in the over. A nice clip from him puts Jennings back at the business end and he’s immediately hit on the pad and there’s a big shout! Turned down by Umpire Gaffaney. No review and that’s confirmed by the TV replay as the right call as it was a fraction high. 3rd over: England 15-0 (Cook 5, Jennings 6) Afternoon to you all from Trent Bridge. Tim will be back with us later today. For now, Shami is running away from me with my seat right over his arm in the press box. Jennings is far from set, beaten by a full delivery that doesn’t carry to the wicketkeeper Pant. This is a vital innings for the left-hander with Ed Smith clearly happy to drop players earlier rather than later. Maiden. 2nd over: England 15-0 (Cook 5, Jennings 6) Jennings edges again, as Bumrah finds some lift with his first ball, and what should have been an easy catch at fourth slip becomes yet another four to third man. Kohli then plugs the gap, bearing out Nasser’s theory that he’s a stable-door captain. And Pant fumbles another take. A comedy of errors, which Adam Collins will now report for you. See you after tea, if the game lasts that long.1st over: England 10-0 (Cook 5, Jennings 1) Mohammed Shami opens up, and Alastair Cook edges the first ball – wide of Kohli at third slip and away for four. “Cook has as many Test wickets as fifties here at Trent Bridge,” Mike Atherton notes, with some relish. Keaton Jennings too gets off the mark with a false shot, a leading edge to a full in swinger. And the last ball brings four byes to open Pant’s account as a keeper, though he did well to get a glove to it. Kim Thonger has started something with his email about why the Spanish don’t play cricket. “They do,” says Adrian Armstrong. “See www.cricketspain.es, which also includes a brief outline of the game’s history in Spain. Apparently things didn’t really develop until 1975, which leads me to wonder whether cricket might have been banned - or at least officially disapproved of - under Franco.”A suggestion from Ian Sergeant. “If Kim could get over to the barossa beach (just south of Cadiz) in a couple of hours, we’ll get a game going on the beach. Tide will be right out by then.”“Kim Thonger should consider,” says Geoff, “that having lunch from 2 until 4 followed by an hour or two of siesta might cut into a day’s play.”“George Bernard Shaw reckoned that the English, not being a very spiritual people, invented cricket to give themselves some idea of eternity,” says Peter Wood. “The Spanish, by contrast, have had no such need.”So India, with a strong lower order on paper, have made 23-4 today. Broad finishes with 3-72, Anderson with 3-64, and the second new ball has done the trick for England, perhaps because the Indians hadn’t seen one for several months. It’s England whose tails are up, but it’s India who have runs in the bank. Game very much on.Anderson produces a ball that is far too good for Bumrah, pitching middle, swinging away to hit middle and send both bails flying. Clinical stuff from the two old geezers.Shami goes for the old yahoo, grazes the clouds, and presents Broad with a simple catch at mid-on.92nd over: India 329-8 (Sharma 1, Shami 3) Broad dispatches Ashwin and beats Sharma all ends up. In between, Shami does well to drive another full inswinger for three. But the Indians may not be too sad to see this booming swing. Could be a lot of wickets today.S Broad tries the inswinger, and it’s a beauty, ripping out R Ashwin’s middle stump.91st over: India 326-7 (Ashwin 14, Sharma 1) A fine over from Anderson, who is swinging it like Anderson, ends in a dropped catch as Ashwin edges yet again and Pope spills it, low to his left, at fourth slip. It was sharp but not impossible. Here’s Mac Millings, responding to my point in the 89th over. “I think cricket is such that the fact that leg byes shouldn’t exist means that they should.” That may be peak OBO.91st over: India 323-7 (Ashwin 12, Sharma 0) After a curious little delay caused by a flappy sock, Broad gets rid of Pant. But that was a highly promising 20 from a 20-year-old, the third of the series following Curran and Pope. Pant has all the shots, and he also seems to know when not to play them, which made his demise unexpected. Broad gave him a send-off, which was graceless, but perhaps a compliment.Jeff Docherty picks up on John Starbuck’s point (11:14). “Has Mr S had a tipple, a late evening or just lost track of time? Hadlee began his Trent Bridge career in 1978! In recent times the pitch has become famous for its batting virtues... England have broken two ODI world records there. However it is true that many previously fast pitches have ‘lost’ their zip, as flamboyant batting is generally favoured over bowling.”Broad pitches it up and, as if by magic, Pant drags it on.90th over: India 323-6 (Pant 24, Ashwin 12) Ashwin, apparently determined to score all his runs through the cordon, squirts a four past gully, but he was in reasonable control, playing it late. And then he edges past third slip for four more. Nasser is banging on about England’s old firm bowling too short, quite rightly. Where’s Sam Curran when you need him? “The rain in Spain,” says an email subject line. It’s Kim Thonger. “Writing from the terrace of the Alcazar in Segovia, nursing the first beer of the day (we’re an hour ahead, shush), richly deserved after climbing 203 steps to the top of the cathedral tower. A bit like Wayne Daniel’s run-up, only vertical. Anyway, my question is, why don’t the Spanish play cricket? They have the weather, the beer, the potential for dry turning pitches and a splendidly laidback attitude worthy of Sir Vivian Richards. Or perhaps they do play somewhere? I need enlightenment please.”89th over: India 315-6 (Pant 24, Ashwin 4) Broad’s over to Pant goes for just a couple of leg byes, which, as we established this time yesterday, shouldn’t exist. “Hello Tim.” Hello Andrew Benton. “A scan of relevant internet pages suggests only a handful of Test players have preferred to go by their initials over the years – M.J.K. Smith, M.S.K. Prasad, V.R.V. Singh, V.V.S Laxman amongst those leading the fray with three initials, and with Sir H.D.G. Leveson-Gower at number one, sporting a double-barrelled surname and a knighthood to boot. Isn’t there something a bit classy about going by your initials (?). A.J. Benton.”89th over: India 313-6 (Pant 24, Ashwin 4) You’ll never guess who’s bowling from the other end: Jimmy Anderson. Pant, standing outside his crease, Kohli-style, treats him with respect and takes another single to square leg off the last ball. An email from Patrick Morgan. “The R Ashwin discussion reminds me of X Billups, my fave character in To Kill a Mockingbird. But while Mr Ashwin (streaky four, there) simply prefers the use of his initial, Mr Billups is known as X because that is his given name. Cheers, P Morgan.”88th over: India 312-6 (Pant 23, Ashwin 4) Broad gets one to jag away like a leg-break, but it’s well wide of off, and Pant isn’t a young man in such a hurry that he’s going to nibble at those in the first over. He dabs a single into the on side like an old pro. And then Ashwin flashes for four over second slip, where Jos Buttler’s instinct is to duck, but it’s probably out of reach anyway. “Despite the 1st day stumps score.” says Krish, “this match will be over by day 4 or maximum morning session of day 5. Indians in 2nd innings will start swinging their bats around, so it will not matter even if the ball does not swing.” You may well be right. The players are on the field, and Stuart Broad has the ball in his hand. He’ll be bowling to Rishabh Pant, so anything could happen.The county championship is back, not before time. And Graham Hardcastle is covering it for you.The start has gone back another 15 minutes, to 11.30. But who needs any play when there’s an email from John Starbuck? “‘Morning, Tim,” he murmurs, and yes, that is an apostrophe at the front. “The pitch doesn’t have to be slow. Indeed, during Richard Hadlee’s heyday here, all the pitches were notably fast. It looks like England rely too much on the swing side of bowling and hope for the right atmosphere. Granted, you can only do the best for the bowlers you have, but this can change rather faster than pitch preparation time allows. “Also, is there something about Mr Ashwin that means he has to be referred to as R? Ravi, or Ravichandran isn’t difficult to spell or pronounce. Some players are often known by their initials but this is usually for more than one e.g. KL Rahul, AB de Villiers etc.” It is, but he prefers to be just R Ashwin. Like J Hus, or O Henry. The moment of the day yesterday was Alastair Cook’s catch at first slip to break the big stand between Rahane and Kohli. He saw it so late – or sensed so late that Bairstow wasn’t going for it – that his body only moved towards the ball after his hand had nabbed it. “Trying to find a video of Cook’s much lauded catch yesterday, one that plays in my region (SE Asia),” writes Leo Nine. If you’re on Twitter, here’s a cheeky grab off the telly. And who are we to talk about that.Set fair? What kind of idiot would write that? There’s been some drizzle at Trent Bridge, and the start has been put back to 11.15. So we’ve got time to give this a spin – the Velvets at their most velvety.The first email of the day comes from somewhere in Germany. “Could you please show the link to the radio commentary,” asks David. With a bit of luck, it’s here.Morning everyone and welcome to the second day of the third Test. Sunday is the new Friday, and India are themselves again – making biggish runs after being put in to bat by Joe Root. A score of 307-6 was just what the Indians needed, and just what the series needed. They were wary and watchful, mostly playing the ball under their eyes, yet they still rattled along at three and a half an over. They even made it to the second new ball for the first time in the series. They lost Hardik Pandya to the last ball of the day, but they still have R Ashwin, far too classy to be down at No 8, and the dashing debutant Rishabh Pant, who bats as if he’s the love child of MS Dhoni and Virender Sehwag. It would serve England right if the game was taken away from them by a 20-year-old. The pitch is slow but even-handed, offering something for everyone except the raw pacemen that neither side has brought along. India could end up with anything from 330 to 500. Ideally, it’ll be around 350, which might lead to their being 100 ahead on first innings, if their seamers pitch it up like Woakes, or 100 behind if Root or Cook (or Woakes) gets the big score that eluded Kohli and Rahane. The weather is set fair, and so is the game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c387506c3e4fcef582f43f5d9e59a533f38f0235/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7892e86cd5f171d1084c961fd8a383a4","title":"mat ewins review just the tonic the mash house edinburgh fringe festival","story":"Just the Tonic at the Mash House, EdinburghArtistry and geekery combine in a set that shows off Ewins’ clever video editing and pranksterish sense of funBrexit. #MeToo. Editing a newspaper on Mars. One of those isn’t a popular topic among fringe comics. Indeed, I can imagine only one comedian making a show about it. Step forward, Mat Ewins, 2017 comedy award nominee and multimedia noodler extraordinaire. Last year, he unleashed his fiendish programming and editing skills – and all-conquering sense of fun – on a spoof Indiana Jones epic. Now he ventures deeper into hi-tech tricksiness – but also reveals more of himself – in this tenuous foray into interstellar media. It’s ceaselessly inventive and daft – and it’s “piffle” (Ewins’ word) too. How else to describe his videos of football matches with the ball removed, or his all-new Martian sport that involves catching cats with a magnetic moustache. The newspaper narrative is only ever a thread from which to hang these techie sketches, and even its denouement is constructed as a video game, in which the audience controls Ewins’ editor character in a high-stakes – and highly-ridiculous - job interview scenario. Here as elsewhere, Ewins’ audience interplay – and his standup too – is mediated through a screen. The identities of several punters are fed into his byzantine system, and then crop up in compromising positions throughout the show. Later, bemoaning his lack of spontaneity vis-a-vis other comics, Ewins “riffs” in real time using video effects software. But there’s artistry as well as geekery at play. His videos have a sumptuous retro-futurist aesthetic, splicing Blade Runner and the swinging 60s then straining them through a Super 8 filter. More insistently than last year, Ewins also commentates on his own anorak brand of comedy, usually in derogatory terms. It’s a poor substitute for his dreams of being an actor, he tells us, or – after nine years being single – for having a love life.

Her ruling was a lifeline for the company, which in September had been told that Transport for London would not renew its licence. However, after the Observer highlighted her husband’s work for a strategy firm that has advised one of Uber’s largest investors, a spokesman for the judiciary confirmed that Arbuthnot would not hear Uber-related cases in the future. “The chief magistrate had been due to hear a licensing appeal by Uber in Brighton at a date yet to be fixed,” the spokesman said.“However, as soon as this link was pointed out to her, she assigned the case to a fellow judge. It is essential that judges not only are, but are seen to be, absolutely impartial.” The spokesman said it was the first time that such a connection had been brought to the chief magistrate’s attention.Lord Arbuthnot, a former Tory MP for Wanstead and Woodford, and then North East Hampshire, and chair of the defence select committee, was nominated for a peerage by David Cameron in 2015. He was until 31 December last year, three weeks after the start of Uber’s London appeal, a director of SC Strategy Ltd. Little is known about the private intelligence company, founded by Lord Carlile, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, and Sir John Scarlett, the head of MI6 between 2004 and 2009. It has no website and eschews publicity.One of its few known clients has been the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the giant sovereign wealth fund that invests billions around the world.In December 2014, in a story that was not denied at the time by the QIA and was picked up globally by other media outlets, the Wall Street Journal reported that the fund was one of the main investors to have participated in a $1.2bn financing round for Uber.Although Arbuthnot stood down as a director of SC Strategy at the end of last year, his parliamentary website states that he remains a senior consultant to the firm, a remunerated position. Mick Rix, national officer with the GMB union which contested Uber’s London licence, said it had not known of the links between Lady Arbuthnot’s husband, SC Strategy and one of Uber’s largest shareholders.“GMB is surprised by the suggested connection between magistrate Arbuthnot’s husband and Uber,” Rix said. “Any matter which may be perceived as a conflict of interest is required to be drawn to the attention of the parties involved in any litigation at the outset.”The spokesman for the judiciary said the chief magistrate and her husband had been unaware that the QIA was an investor in Uber or had any links to it. The spokesman added: “The judiciary will have to consider whether the new information could be seen to change the perception of absolute impartiality.” Magistrates are bound by the Judicial Code of Conduct. It acknowledges that even the appearance of a possible conflict of interest may disqualify them. It ensures that a judge will be mindful of such possible conflicts and can draw relevant matters to the attention of the parties in the case. It states: “The question whether an appearance of bias or possible conflict of interest is sufficient to disqualify an officeholder from hearing a case is the subject of Strasbourg, English and Welsh and Commonwealth jurisprudence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf1939131cb1648aab456809601314e181797efe/0_325_4928_2955/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfc1722b0d900b165148ad0fc25b8f59","title":"elon musk tesla excruciating year","story":"The Tesla founder acknowledged that the past year has been ‘most difficult and painful’ time in his career – but what brought him there? It’s been a horrible year for Elon Musk. One even he acknowledges couldn’t have been much worse. “This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,” the billionaire entrepreneur said in an New York Times interview published on Friday. “It was excruciating.”And if recent history is anything to go by, it may get worse. Just when Musk’s adventures in popular science, from private trips to Mars, high-speed tunnels under Los Angeles to the mass-production of electric sports cars, look like they can’t get weirder, they do.The Times reported that the 47-year-old entrepreneur alternated between laughter and tears as he described how he has been working 120 hours a week, often staying in the Tesla factory for three or four days straight. The board is worried by his use of Ambien to allow him to sleep – sometimes it appears to have the opposite effect and they are worried he uses Twitter in a mood-altered state.“If there’s a common denominator to Elon Musk’s troubles over the past two months, it’s Twitter,” Gene Munster, head of research at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, wrote to investors on Friday as Tesla’s shares slid again following the interview.And then there is Azealia Banks. Last weekend the Harlem-born rapper, who is never one to shy from an online battle, was hanging out at Musk’s Los Angeles home hoping to finish a collaboration with the musician Grimes, the billionaire entrepreneur’s girlfriend, for Banks’ new album, Fantasea II: The Second Wave.“Literally been sitting at Elon Musks waiting for Grimes to show up and start these sessions,” Banks wrote in an Instagram story. In a conversation with Business Insider, Banks said she’d been sitting in Musk’s home alone for “days”, while Grimes coddled Musk for “being too stupid not to go on Twitter while on acid”.Those comments came after Musk tweeted he had “secured” funding to take Tesla, his troubled electric car company, private. Tesla’s share price shot up and now the US’s top financial watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – and investors – want to know just how “secure” that funding is. Musk says he has never met Banks, but could this bizarre tale lead to her being interviewed by the SEC?If investigators conclude Musk overstated the nature of the financing, that could form the basis for bringing a market manipulation case.But corporate governance experts see a different scenario playing out. Musk’s first tweet alone would not be a problem, especially if he’d made a full public statement, but Musk’s “in-your-face attitude toward the SEC” is a different matter, argues John Coffee, professor of corporate guidance at Columbia University.“‘Funding secured’ means you have a firm commitment to able to raise the money you need. He had nothing of the sort,” Coffee argues. Musk’s first tweet was clearly not reviewed by a lawyer, he says, and subsequent communications showed Musk had “at best, a glimmer of hope” he might get some funding from the Saudis.“He may have made an exaggerated, overstated material misstatement for which he could be sued privately and, under different course of action, by the SEC.”But unlike two class-action suits brought this week alleging that Musk’s funding claims were misleading, a SEC action would not have to prove “scienter” – an intent to defraud or extreme recklessness – to prevail.The SEC, he says, could impose a fine and bring injunction forcing Musk to agree to not making public statements in the future. But they are unlikely to go further and seek a bar order against Musk, a penalty reserved for clearly fraudulent actions.“The SEC would clearly be open to settling,” Coffee says. “Elon Musk has value to the shareholders. If they separate him from Tesla, its stock price might fall by half. That could force Tesla to go private, since the order would mean nothing to a private company.”A fine might not mean much to someone as rich as Musk – who Forbes values at over $20bn – but any settlement would probably include some “structural relief”, in this case an agreement to not to make public statements without prior approval from a chief corporate legal officer or the board, along with paying a penalty.“At least that would be a way of getting a little more responsibility into the process,” says Coffee. “But we don’t know Musk would agree to that. We have the impression that he’s a somewhat impulsive man. Entrepreneurs who’ve become billionaires by age 30 often think they have reason for confidence in their own judgment.”Musk’s erratic behaviour comes as Tesla could face a cash-crunch later this year if production of the Model 3 – Tesla’s cheapest electrical vehicle – fails to ramp up sufficiently to put the company into the black. Analysts estimate the company will have to raise at least an additional $10bn to begin development and production of electric trucks and expansion in China.But the latest episode comes on the back of a series of bizarre episodes, including calling a Briton who helped to rescue a group of boys from a cave in Thailand a “pedo” on Twitter, for which he later apologised.Investors and the Tesla board are reportedly now looking for adult supervision. Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, was approached about the job a couple of years ago and other tech companies, most notably Google, have benefited from bringing in experienced directors to guide the company from its startup roots and help it navigate the responsibilities of public ownership.Musk told the Times that no search was currently under way. Others said the search had intensified.Amid the turmoil, Musk has also displayed flashes of more sober thinking. In an interview with YouTuber Marques Brownlee published on Saturday, he displayed none of neuroses described by the Times.Asked if Tesla could produce an inexpensive electric car – the price of a baseline Model 3 is $49,000 – Musk said it would take Tesla “maybe” three years to come up with a $25,000 version.“In order to make cars more affordable you need high volume and economies of scale,” he said, adding that Tesla’s smaller production capacity made it hard to compete against producers like General Motors or Ford.He said the key to selling a product is having something people love and will talk about, but Tesla was “really focused on making cars more affordable”.There are several more chapters to this story, Coffee predicts, that potentially include a dramatic fall in Tesla’s stock price or the Saudis deciding to “walk away from the whole mess”.“We also have a president who has the same confidence in his own judgment and who roils the markets,” says Coffee. “It’s worked out for Trump but I’m not sure it’s working out as well for Musk.”It’s a conclusion Musk himself seems to agree with. “From a personal pain standpoint, the worst is yet to come,” he told the Times.

Fika is the most recent Swedish tradition spreading across the globe. “It’s about taking time out of your day to actually sit down and maybe relax with someone or maybe yourself – usually over coffee and cake,” says Simon Forsythe, Glasgow-based owner of For Fika Sake.Forsythe’s space is part cafe, part community hangout and part creative workplace. Covering 185 sq m (2,000 sq ft) in the centre of Glasgow, For Fika Sake is drawing in everyone from students and freelancers to yogis and parenting groups who want to engage with other locals and like-minded people while learning something new.Forsythe brought the idea to life in January 2016, opening the doors after a year of planning. “It started when I was having fika at a cafe in town with a friend,” he says. “I was working a part-time job in a normal cafe and was fed up with that experience. She was running music workshops in Glasgow and wanted to work on a different project.” After bringing in one other partner, they came up with the name: For Fika Sake. “We thought up a funny, controversial title, a play on words and we stuck with that and went with it,” says Forsythe.The sense of community created by the cafe extends beyond its doors – the coffee, tea, and cake that give the space its name are sourced from local suppliers. On any day of the week you can walk into For Fika Sake to find people filling the space with music from an old piano donated by a local social enterprise, in pottery workshops run by local artists up on the mezzanine, discussing their latest reads during a book club, or catching up with friends.“It’s great to have this kind of community coming in and using the space for what it was originally designed for,” says Forsythe. “One in particular that stands out is the community for young parents. The big space means they can come in and store their prams in the corner and hang out with other parents and their babies.”After a challenging start, seeing the space come to life has been the big payoff for Forsythe. In December 2016, he had to take on the business himself after his two partners left to pursue other projects. “It was a bit of a shock,” he says. “But the business seems to have taken off since last January.” While he admits it was tough, particularly with the other stresses that come with starting a new small business – like big overheads – he says one of the perks to come out of it is being able to make decisions quickly and easily. “There was no compromise-with-partners involved, so I was able to get things done and out of the way,” he says.Now word of mouth has spread and the business is growing, and that quick decision-making is allowing Forsythe to try new ideas and systems to keep things running smoothly. He recently switched over to a new platform to help him get on top of his cashflow. He chose Square because he liked the “cool and simple” card machine – but also because he could access his funds the next working day.“It’s made a massive difference,” he says. “With this kind of business the most important thing for survival is cashflow, so being able to access your funds the next working day is a serious win. If it’s over the weekend you get your cash on Monday rather than Wednesday.”It’s also given him the time and freedom to focus on drumming up creative ideas for new workshops and events to help the cafe thrive. But if creating a community hub was the grand idea behind the space, it’s the cafe and fostering the tradition around fika that Forsythe reckons is the powerhouse of the enterprise. “It keeps the business going and it creates that space for people to use the workshop side of things,” he says.Using Square’s app, he can create a product button for a new kind of service on the spot – a convenience he appreciates, given the ever-changing use of the space and the introduction of new workshops and events. “Overall, it’s running nice and smoothly and going with that original plan, which is amazing to see.”Where does he see himself next? Hopefully with a second space, in a few years, although perhaps somewhere sunnier. “I’d love to see it grow and take on another premises in another part of Glasgow or potentially in another city,” he says. “But working on what we have right now and just gearing up more towards the community and growing it within this community is still number one.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ba9fb0cd94b3727b172ce58b9f63d05e2545a5/0_1090_2077_1245/master/2077.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ddd9ef800dd50fd785b494bb4a7d438","title":"sweden adventure holiday kayak gothenburg tjorn island fjord camping","story":"On the third leg of his Scandi trip, Kevin Rushby and son kayak the fjords of a huge archipelago, camp on magical islands – and meet not a single other person• Scandi tour: part 2, part 1We round the headland and see the island for the first time: a distant ridge of bare granite with a lighthouse on one end. At the same time we hit the swell and the wind sizzles spray off the wave tops, whipping it into our faces as we drive the kayaks forward. For a moment I wonder if this island might be a little far out for us, too far from the safe inner channels that we have been following for two days now.Back at our starting point in a kayaking centre on the island of Tjörn, the owner, Patrik, had been very clear about our options, pointing out various camping spots on the 8,000 islands and islets that are scattered to the north of Gothenburg. Each had its advantages: this one was sheltered from easterlies, that one had a grassy flat area. But one particular island had caught my eye: Räbbe Huvud. It was far from any settlements and close to a nature reserve on a much larger neighbouring island.Birdwatchers talk about recognising the “jizz” of a bird, the mysterious intuitive process of identification that operates beyond words. I reckon that certain configurations on a map can do that. Something about the shape, the position and the name reaches out and grabs your imagination. That place is calling. A journey is required.Niall, my son, leads the way across the straits and into the lee of the island. It astonishes me how quickly we have adapted to sea kayak life, instinctively seeking shelter from the wind or zigzagging across open water to avoid getting side-on to the waves. Once in the shadow of Räbbe Huvud we relax and examine the place.“It looks wild,” shouts Niall. There are no trees at all, just great piles of massive pinkish granite, all eroded and rounded and split by winter ice, each one a Henry Moore masterpiece. We spot a tiny landing beach and head in. The sea suddenly becomes dark and spits tiny silver fish. The sand sighs as it strokes the underside of the kayak. A cuckoo calls. We make landfall.It was in the excellent book Wild Scandinavia that I had spotted a brief entry concerning the Swedish province of Bohuslän and its islands. I liked the idea of a multi-day wild camping adventure in what was described as a sheltered archipelago. Unfortunately, we had arrived as a period of good weather ended. Patrik had pointed out danger points, and escape routes: narrow ginnels between islands, some only a few metres wide.The first night was on Grimsholmen, a lovely island, uninhabited but within sight of a village. Our prayers for dry driftwood were answered and a camp fire cooked the spuds. No fish were caught. Next day was a five-hour paddle, passingthe fishing towns of Skärhamn and Kyrkesund, where we stopped for coffee and made the decision to go for the remoter island.Back on Räbbe Huvud we erect our tent (a freestanding model helps as sometimes you might pitch on rock) and head off to explore. We swim in a fabulous deepwater creek, full of bronze kelp, schools of fish and sudden glimpses of crabs. (Our small lobster creel, set here overnight, catches edible and velvet crabs, two fish and a large eel, all of which we set free.) Above water the island is a miracle of survival: tiny plants make homes in cracks, and insects thrive. We leap across dark narrow gorges and shimmy up slabs of smooth stone. Later we catch mackerel on a spinner. I feel I could happily stay for weeks, but the wind rises overnight.At dawn we sneak away, clinging to the coast, and slip into a sheltered channel, Stigfjorden, that leads into a vast area of sheltered sea and islands. One of them, Kälkerön, is another nature reserve, and we circle the island looking for the right camping spot. In one bay there are barbecue pits, grassy pitches and a little sea cliff hung with ropes to swing on. There are signs of other campers here, but in the entire trip we don’t encounter another person on any of the islands.That night the wind rises again and morning reveals a sea swarming with whitecaps. Stigfjorden is not as sheltered as we hoped. With some trepidation we bash across it, breathing sighs of relief when we reach a serene side fjord. Once again we find a great camping spot, paddling into a small bay flanked by granite cliffs, then drifting right up to deer grazing on the shingle beach. At night, our fire is the only light we can see apart from the stars.On the fifth day we meet Patrik at the appointed place. We are weary – the last paddle was a battle against the elements – but elated. It has been a remarkable experience. Could anyone do this trip? Patrik is confident they can. “I chat to people and assess their abilities. For real beginners or small children we have a quiet lake. For experienced kayakers, there’s no limit.”We finish with another of Lottas’ superlative breakfasts, not a cheap experience, but we have not spent anything for several days, so why not?• The trip was provided by Visit Sweden (visitsweden).

But one thing about the wedding of the Austrian foreign minister, Karin Kneissl, stood out: among the guests was the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.The exact details of Putin’s controversial “private” visit weren’t confirmed until the last minute, when his private plane touched down at the tiny Graz regional airport early yesterday afternoon. The airport was briefly closed to passengers and sealed off by a large police presence supported by Austria’s elite Cobra taskforce.Putin’s party then travelled in a convoy of black vans to the Tscheppe restaurant, known for its Backhendl chicken, and boasting a terrace overlooking a mountain vineyard in the picturesque Alpine state of Styria.Television pictures showed Kneissl, 53, who had arrived earlier together with her groom, businessman Wolfgang Meilinger, accepting a bunch of flowers from Putin at the gate. And the two politicians then shared a dance – witnessed by the only photographer granted access to the ceremony.Putin’s entourage included the choir, which serenaded the couple and their guests, among them Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz of the conservative Austrian People’s party and vice chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache from the far-right Freedom party (FPÖ). The Russian president left a short time afterwards, rushing off to Berlin for wide-ranging bilateral talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel.Kneissl, an independent, owes her appointment as foreign minister to the populist, anti-immigrant FPÖ, the junior party in Austria’s ruling coalition. A polyglot who speaks seven languages including Arabic and Hebrew, she was previously known as a journalist and Middle East analyst who made frequent appearances on Austrian broadcaster ORF and in recent years shifted to the right.Putin’s attendance at her wedding drew anger from opponents who said it undermined the EU’s stance against Russia over Ukraine. For Kneissl to invite “the most aggressive foreign adversary of the EU” to a private celebration was “completely unacceptable”, Austrian Green MEP Michel Reimon said last week, calling for her resignation.Kneissl’s display of warmth to Putin also prompted outrage in Kiev, and sparked calls for Austria to withdraw from the EU Commission’s efforts to mediate an end to the frozen conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the country’s east.“It goes without saying: if you invite Vladimir Putin to your wedding, you are not neutral any more,” tweeted Ukrainian MP and foreign affairs committee member Hanna Hopko. “From now on, Austria can’t be a mediator in Ukraine. Period.”In a later Facebook post Hopko demanded Russia be held to account for the Skripal nerve agent attack in the UK, the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 and alleged war crimes in Aleppo, Syria.The Austrian government said Putin attended as “a personal guest”. Foreign ministry spokesman Matthias Forenbacher said: “No change will result in terms of Austria’s foreign policy position.”Kneissl first met the Russian president 17 years ago at a summit in Slovenia with the then US President George Bush in July 2001. A self-proclaimed “conservative free spirit,” she belongs to no party and has proved a isive figure since her appointment to Austria’s rightwing coalition cabinet last December.Kneissl’s scepticism over Austria’s acceptance of refugees from the Middle East won applause from the FPÖ and gained her the foreign ministry when the populists rose to power last December. Kneissl has sharply criticised the EU’s handling of Brexit and Catalonia’s drive for independence and poured scorn on Angela Merkel’s open-door migration policy, which she has called “grossly negligent”.Putin’s attendance at the wedding could be taken as a slight in Berlin, where Merkel had dampened expectations for Saturday’s “working meeting,” the first time the leaders had met since a fractious summit in Sochi in May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c49484b1fc9ff3ba44f97dd1db77fa2cf319055/0_338_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=360b12f45ce2eefeaa2144df317f8fa4","title":"cape town bo kaap muslim enclave gentrification","story":"Sunday morning in Cape Town. Two days of rain have washed the dust from the air. Table Mountain is etched against a clear blue southern winter sky. Seagulls wheel on an ocean breeze. In the Bo-Kaap neighbourhood of the city, the famous painted houses shine postcard perfect. Children play on cobbled streets. Men in prayer caps watch, deep in conversation, prayer beads clicking.Yet the apparent calm is misleading. In recent weeks angry young men have burned tyres in the streets of Bo-Kaap. There have been marches and demonstrations. The immediate spark for the anger? Plans to build hotels, luxury apartments and shops. The deeper cause? Fear that gentrification will destroy the community.“We are the last barrier ... If we give in, the floodgates will open and that’s the end,” said Jacky Poking, a local resident and activist.The protests have attracted media attention across South Africa. Some reports have portrayed an economic struggle between haves and have-nots. Others have highlighted a faith angle – most of Bo-Kaap’s estimated 6,000 people are Muslim. The reality, however, is more complicated than either interpretation suggests.Though South Africa’s economy is in deep trouble, Cape Town is booming. Startups, conferences, tourism and demand from wealthy foreigners attracted by the climate and lifestyle have pushed up property prices in the comfortable, clean and stunningly beautiful city centre. Houses in the best neighbourhoods sell for millions and even the “cottages” of Bo-Kaap now sell for 6.6m rand (£350,000). Many locals are selling to outsiders.Developers are moving in, too, looking to build high-end hotels, or new blocks of apartments aimed at the city’s growing population of young professionals. A handful have some element of social housing – but even that is priced too high for most local people, members of the community say.“The authorities here do not want poor people in the city. They want this to be a rich city,” said Fauzia Ahmed, 68, who lives in a sturdy terraced home on Jordaan Street in Bo-Kaap.But the argument over Bo-Kaap is not simply about the future. It is also about the past. The racist, repressive government that took power in South Africa in 1948 enforced the ision of cities across the nation into ethnically distinct areas. The effect on Cape Town was particularly dramatic. Poor “non-white” communities were exiled to bleak new settlements on the hot and dusty flatlands to the east of the city, far from the picturesque coastline with its fresh breeze and beaches.But some escaped the enforced removal. Ahmed and her family lived in District Six, a bustling mixed community in the centre of Cape Town. The authorities progressively levelled the neighbourhood in the 1960s and early 1970s, sending its inhabitants to the new townships. Ahmed’s family held on until bulldozers had razed almost everything. Only then did they leave their home. With great difficulty, Ahmed’s parents raised loans to buy the house in Bo-Kaap where she still lives.“It was very traumatic, very brutal. The memory has stayed with me to this day,” said Ahmed.The family could live in Bo-Kaap because it was designated as a home for the “Cape Malay” or “Cape Muslim” community under the twisted apartheid laws designed to enforce segregation. Though on prime real estate in the centre of the city, the neighbourhood thus became a unique enclave where few white south Africans ever ventured and none lived.Ahmed remembers “dangerous but terribly exciting” times fighting the apartheid regime through the 1970s and 1980s.“We were united. We used to hide the ANC activists here and we never had a single arrest. There was such solidarity,” she said. When Nelson Mandela, the Nobel prize laureate and first president of a free South Africa, was released from prison in February 1990, Ahmed was “ecstatic”. The apartheid system was ended definitively four years later with the nation’s first free elections. “I dreamed of a better future,” she said.The disappointment of many South Africans at the failure to fulfil the lofty hopes of the early 1990s is one reason for the strong feelings provoked by the gentrification of Bo-Kaap. Ralph Mathekga, a political analyst and author, said the ownership of land in South Africa had become a way to define “freedom against a lack of freedom”.“It is not about its commercial value. It’s about identity, history and destiny of people in our society. With Bo-Kaap, it’s a place of historical importance, but the people who have suffered in previous decades cannot afford to live there any more,” Mathekga said.One major issue being acrimoniously debated in the run-up to general elections next year is the future of the many huge farms in South Africa, many of which are still owned by the descendants of the Dutch settlers who founded Cape Town almost 400 years ago before spreading out across what was to become South Africa. The question touches on a broader issue too: the disproportionate wealth of the white minority in South Africa a generation after the ANC came to power.In Cape Town, the physical legacy of apartheid town planning is still very obvious. Travellers arriving at the airport, out on the dusty flats, fly over thousands of tin homes with only rudimentary sanitation or power. Their inhabitants still travel for hours on overcrowded public transport to work in the city centre or as domestics in the houses of its stunning suburbs.Councillor Brett Herron, the city of Cape Town’s mayoral committee member for transport and urban development, said authorities were aware of all these issues and were doing what they could, given available resources.Herron said officials had repeatedly tried to answer the concerns of many Bo-Kaap residents, but could not stop private iniduals selling properties in the neighbourhood to buyers from other areas or countries, or to private developers.However, many residents remains unconvinced by such assurances. The fight in Bo-Kaap will be long, Ahmed said. “This is my house, my inheritance … They will have to drag me out of my home.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35f2c38338e47a7cf1ad360d2890f084f59d0177/0_95_2641_1585/master/2641.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cca304d0dd672bee80ef3387ebc5fa0","title":"government investigates fresh reports of looting of sunken navy ships","story":"Gavin Williamson says he will work closely with Indonesia and Malaysia over claims Second World War ships have been plundered The government is investigating fresh reports that a number of British second world war wrecks in Asia have been plundered by grave robbers.The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, said he was “very concerned” to hear allegations that remains of four ships lying off the Malaysian and Indonesian coasts have been looted.It comes after six wrecks, including Royal Navy battleships HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse, were feared to have been damaged or destroyed by scavengers.Altogether the wrecks are thought to be the final resting place for hundreds of Royal Navy sailors and civilians.Williams said the government “absolutely condemns” the unauthorised disturbance of any wreck containing human remains.“I am very concerned to hear any allegations of incidents of Royal Navy wrecks being plundered in the Far East,” he said.“We will work closely with the Indonesian and Malaysian governments to investigate these claims.”The Mail on Sunday said wrecks of HMS Tien Kwang, HMS Kuala, HMS Banka and SS Loch Ranza had recently been targeted by thieves for their metal.HMS Tien Kwang, a submarine chaser, and HMS Kuala, an auxiliary patrol vessel, were carrying hundreds of evacuees when they were attacked by Japanese bombers near the Indonesian Riau Islands in February 1942.Earlier that month the SS Loch Ranza, a cargo ship, had been set on fire in a Japanese air raid off the Riau Islands and exploded, killing seven men.It came after HMS Banka, a minesweeper, sank after hitting a mine off the coast of Malaysia in December 1941, killing its crew of four British officers and 34 Malay sailors.Looters are said to favour targeting the second world war-era wrecks because of the ship steel’s properties.In 2014, the ships, the last resting places of more than 830 Royal Navy sailors, were found to have been damaged by scavengers.

I’m having to have special shoes made for me because Strictly didn’t have any big enough.”Kate Silverton leaving BBC studios on Friday eveningThe presenter, who is 5ft 10in, was introduced to a selection of Strictly’s costumes earlier this week. She said having two children in her 40s has not knocked her confidence as she prepares to compete for the glitterball trophy.“At 14, I was already a shoe size eight and, while my school friends delighted in wearing the latest styles, I was still in Clarks Classics or — horror of horrors — boys\u0027 shoes,” she said.“Earlier this week, I tried on a costume. It was very short,  like wearing a swimsuit. When I put it on I thought: ‘This is how I am. This is how I look. Embrace it.’“I\u0027m 48. I\u0027ve had two children in my 40s. My body has actually served me really well.\u0027”But despite her confidence, Silverton still has a couple of caveats for her professional dance partner, who is yet to be announced.She said: “You ask, \u0027Why Strictly?\u0027 Why not Strictly? I love music. I love dancing with the children in the kitchen.Alijaz Skorjanec and Gemma Atkinson on the last season of Strictly“He\u0027s got an element of fun, but equally he will teach me, and there\u0027s going to be a lot to learn.“Let\u0027s say the benchmark is quite low. Whoever I dance with has to be taller, wider and have bigger feet.”It is not the first time Silverton, best known for regularly presenting the BBC’s one, six and ten o’clock news bulletins, has been approached for Strictly.She was offered a position in 2006 and again 2009, but said her personal life, including her struggle to have children, meant the moment was not right.“Where I am right now, everything has come together,” she said.Both Silverton’s children, Clemency, six, and Wilbur, four, were conceived naturally after five failed IVF attempts.The average shoe size of British women is six and only six percent are a size eight or above, according to the British Footwear Association.A BBC spokesperson said:  Our wonderful wardrobe team are creating a pair of custom-made dance shoes to fit Kate’s size 9 feet, which should give her all the support she needs to look amazing on the dancefloor.Scottish fraud suspect put on FBI\u0026#39s \u0026#39most wanted\u0026#39 listBrazil sends troops to Venezuela border after residents drive out migrants from improvised campsLet cameras into court to tame aggressive barristers, says Victims\u0026#39 Commissioner FBI ‘missed chance to question’ London-based professor over Trump campaign links to RussiaWatch: Muslims circle the Kaaba at start of annual Hajj pilgrimageGovernment to investigate fresh claims of plundering of Second World War shipwrecks in AsiaSuperdry co-founder Julian Dunkerton gives £1m to People’s Vote campaign for second Brexit referendumGovernment £200m brownfields building fund falls flat, as number of new homes declinesComment: Trump and Corbyn have both turned political tribes into fanatical cultsRecord £1.1bn recovered in international benefit fraud after government crackdown, new figures showWhite House Counsel Donald McGahn \u0026#39gives coveted details to Mueller\u0026#39s Russia probe\u0026#39Sir Peter Tapsell dies: Former Father of the House and Conservative MP hailed a \u0026#39formidable contributor\u0026#39Council tax and stamp duty should be set by the mayor’s office, says Tory candidateComment: The EU is reducing Britain’s defence contribution to a Brexit bargaining chip16,000 officials and civil servants are paid by the taxpayer to work full time for their unions, new figures showBritish films may struggle to receive future Oscar nominations because of plans to move the awards ceremony forward by two weekPolice forces relying on civilians to investigate murder and rape, new figures revealWestminster suspect Salih Khater charged with attempted murder over House of Commons barrier crash Hospital patients to be told to get up and dressed to avoid \u0026#39pyjama paralysis\u0026#39\u0026#39Care Isa\u0026#39 exempt from inheritance tax may be launched by government in bid to solve social care crisisWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/08/18/TELEMMGLPICT000171919519_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqejI1gRHJsOsGt35KcRG67xws2wuoei9M_HFF16UY7UM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"building thousands new homes historically priceless d day heroes","story":"Andrewsfield in Essex was the first airfield constructed by the US Air ForceProposals to build thousands of new houses on an airfield that was home to American soldiers who contributed to D Day is an insult, campaigners say.Andrewsfield in Essex was the first airfield constructed by the US Air Force in England during the Second World War and from 1942 - 1945 it was home to the 322d Bomb Group who attacked coastal defences on D Day.However campaigners have warned that the airfield is under threat by the North Essex Garden Communities project, a proposal by the local council to build 10,000 new homes.Andrewsfield falls within an “area of search” for the project, which the council stressed is in its “very early stages.”Dr Mike Frost, a local anesthetist leading the campaign to stop the development, said: “I think it’s very insulting. We wouldn’t walk down Normandy in France and expect to see a load of brand new houses built there, somewhere so significant, so I don’t see why it should happen here.“It is an important monument to the airman who helped us in our darkest hour and it should be preserved for future generations.”The airfield, which was the first of 14 US airfields built in England in the early 1940s, is now private land and has been put up for development by its owners.it was home to the 322d Bomb Group who attacked coastal defences on D DayIt has been an active flying school since 1973 and its manager, Mike Rowland, said the American pilots who lived and worked in Andrewsfield “certainly left their mark” on the area.He said: “The American pilots who used to live and work here would often come back and sign a plaque we have in the main reception. Most of them have passed away now, but still their children come to sign the plaque. As the generations move on, we have recently started getting their great grandchildren visiting too.“Andrewsfield is such a big part of the local community and is very historically significant.”A spokeswoman for the North Essex Garden Communities said: The North Essex Garden Community proposals are subject to approval through the local planning processes which the councils are currently undertaking.“The exact location of housing and other aspects of any new community will be subject to consultation. We are committed to ensuring that local people help us to shape all areas of the new community including Andrewsfield.”The landowners insisted that the developments won’t impact the “historical” aspect of the site, adding: “There’s very little of the original airfield actually left and the area has been scouted for housing since the 1960s.”Galliard Homes, the property developers on the project, were approached for comment.Scottish fraud suspect put on FBI\u0026#39s \u0026#39most wanted\u0026#39 listBrazil sends troops to Venezuela border after residents drive out migrants from

the oneness of God in Islam.Observant Muslims around the world face toward the Kaaba during their five daily prayers.The pilgrimage represents one of the five pillars of Islam and is required of all

In the movie, Stallworth\u0026nbsp(played by\u0026nbspJohn David Washington) manages to prevent a bomb going off at a civil rights rally, making him\u0026nbspa hero on the\u0026nbsppolice force.\u0026nbspHowever, Riley claims the event – along with may other things depicted on screen – was created for the adaptation in order to ender the audience more towards the police. “It’s a made up story in which the false parts of it try to make a cop the protagonist in the fight against racial oppression,” he\u0026nbspwrites.Riley’s alleges\u0026nbspthat Stallworth\u0026nbspwas part of\u0026nbspCOINTELPRO, a series of covert and often illegal operations\u0026nbspconducted by the FBI to disrupt political organisations, and\u0026nbsp“infiltrated a Black radical organisation for three\u0026nbspyears” to\u0026nbsp”sabotage” a group who stood against racist oppression. He\u0026nbspargues that a\u0026nbspFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) proves this and\u0026nbspthat the operations Stallworth took part in\u0026nbspworked against\u0026nbspblack causes.\u0026nbsp“Without the made up stuff and with what we know of the actual history of police infiltration into radical groups, and how they infiltrated and directed White Supremacist organisations to attack those groups, Ron Stallworth is the villain,” Riley writes.\u0026nbsp25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and Watson“To the extent that people of colour deal with actual physical attacks and terrorising due to racism and racist doctrines — we deal with it mostly from the police on a day to day basis. And not just from White cops. From Black cops too. So for Spike to come out with a movie where a story points are fabricated in order make Black cop and his counterparts look like allies in the fight against racism is really disappointing, to put it very mildly.”Riley finishes the essay by pointing out that Lee was allegedly paid $200,000 by the New York Police department to direct an advertising campaign to improve their image with minority communities.\u0026nbsp“Whether it actually is or not, Blackkklansman feels like an extension of that ad campaign,” he concludes.\u0026nbspLee has yet to comment on Riley’s essay.Sorry to Bother YouEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2016/08/16/14/santander-edit.jpg","title":"best student bank account santander nationwide rated which survey","story":"Created with Sketch.RBS and TSB\u0026nbsprank worst in survey of 5,000 studentsClick to followThe Independent OnlineSantander scored five for its sign-up incentives and four on customer serviceSantander and Nationwide provide the best student bank accounts according to new a survey.As half a million university students prepare to start university for the first time, the two lenders achieved the best customer scores of 75 per cent and 72 per cent respectively, Which? found.Santander and Nationwide scored highly on a survey of students as well as in analysis carried out by Which? product testers.The poll of 5,000 students ranked RBS as the worst provider with a score of 54 per cent followed by TSB on 55 per cent.Students were questioned on\u0026nbsptheir satisfaction with their bank and how likely they were to recommend it to someone else.Respondents were also asked to rate the banks on a number of categories on a scale from very poor to excellent.\u0026nbspStudents call on London university to remove ‘anti-homeless’ benchesRecord number of Scottish students awarded university placesCredit card lending continues to rise as interest rate hike loomsBest credit card deals for MarchSantander scored five for its sign-up incentives and four on customer service.

It was a fairly low-key event, with a portable stage not much bigger than the park’s bandstand. The lineup was comprised of mainly tribute acts.Fast forward to 2018, and Bingley Music Live, as the event evolved into, is preparing for its biggest three-day festival yet, on the weekend of Friday 31 August. This time the roster is a little more impressive: Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Jake Bugg, Public Image Ltd, Shed Seven, former Spice Girl Melanie C… and all on a stage that wouldn’t be out of place at one of the summer’s big-name festivals.But, so what? Festivals are big business in the UK, and the summer calendar is stuffed with internationally-renowned acts zipping between fields across the country. Just down the road from Bradford, the Leeds Festival is twinned with its more venerable cousin Reading, and together they form the apex of the festival pyramid with old-stager Glastonbury (when it’s not having a fallow year, like this summer).But also on the calendar is Latitude, the Isle of Wight Festival, RiZE (formerly the V Festival), Wireless, Creamfields, BBC Music’s Big Weekend, Bestival… it seems that no matter where you are in the country, sling a 12in picture disc like a frisbee any time over the summer and you’re almost certain to hit a music superstar on the head.But what makes Bingley Music Live a slightly different beast is that just like the inaugural Music at Myrtle\u0026nbspevent in 1991, it is still run by the local authority. No longer free, of course, because you don’t get Noel Gallagher out of bed on the sort of money you can make up by adding a few quid on the council tax bills. But value for money certainly, compared to the big commercial festivals, and certainly pulling its weight in the ring with many of them.A spokesperson for Bradford Council said\u0026nbspthat when Music at Myrtle was set up in 1991, nobody really expected that it would become the major player it is now. She says:\u0026nbsp“When we held our first small free concert few could have envisaged that the festival would grow to attract such big names as Pet Shop Boys, Kaiser Chiefs, Manic Street Preachers, Chic and Nile Rogers, All Saints, Jess Glynne\u0026nbspand James who have all played over recent years.”The key, though, is that Bingley Music Live has grown organically. Bradford Council never set out to make a full-blown festival, it expanded a little bit year by year. She adds:\u0026nbsp“Although it has come a long way from its humble beginnings and it is unusual for a council to be involved in such a big festival we have grown it gradually and now it sees 15,000 people a day flock to the town for festival weekend.”\u0026nbspIn its early years, Music at Myrtle was split into themed days, with old rockers such as Bradford’s own Smokie on the bill, newer bands for the younger audience, and jazz. In 1998 Bradford Council partnered with local radio station Pulse to make the event a two-day festival, with Pulse using their clout and contacts book to bring in bigger names such as Liberty X, McFly, Rachel Stevens and another Bradford boy-done-good, Gareth Gates.That continued into the 2000s, until what was then billed as the Party in the Park hit its first major bump in the road. In February 2007, the event was summarily cancelled. Rising costs and declining audiences were blamed, and the Pulse’s station director, Tony Wilkinson, told the local paper,\u0026nbsp and\u0026nbspArgus, that support from the music industry for such small festivals was on the wane. He said that the record labels did not have “as many artists out on promotional tours to provide a top class running order”.Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo ParkWhat nobody envisaged in 2007, though, was that the music industry was in the throes of a massive shakeup. Downloading and streaming of music was in its infancy then, and music acts still made the majority of their money from physical album and single sales. However, a decade on, that situation is reversed nowadays it’s the touring of live shows and pounding the festival beat that earns pop and rock bands a crust.It would be nice to think that Bradford Council was playing something of a blinder back in 2007, but the chances are that it was pure serendipity. Either way, within a couple of months of the announcement that the Myrtle Park festival was dead, it rose from the ashes.The original plan was to scale back on the A-listers and give more of a platform to unknown, local bands. The rescue package had been put together wholly by Bradford Council, and they were obviously mindful of the budgetary restrictions of putting on a big festival but still wanting to provide residents with a music event of some description.Indeed, it was the residents of Bingley in particular who lobbied the council to save the festival in some form. This was at a time when the financial crisis was just bubbling over, and it’s fair to say that Bradford had been hit harder than most cities. Neighbouring Leeds had stolen a march on city centre development and by the mid-2000s had a thriving retail and leisure sector that put it in a stronger position to weather the credit crunch.aren’t too far removed from its neighbouring Leeds\u0026nbspBefore the financial collapse, Bradford had been on the up as well. Large swathes of the city centre had been demolished to make way for a brand new shopping centre built by Westfield. The majority of the work on taking down the tired, old buildings began in 2004, but by 2007 everything had stalled, leaving Bradford with an infamous hole in the ground that made it look as though it was ground zero of a meteor strike. It wasn’t until 2015 that the centre was completed and opened… and, to be fair, did help to kickstart a much-needed revitalisation of Bradford.So it was understandable in that atmosphere in 2007 that people wanted some form of entertainment, and Bingley Music Live was it. That year’s festival was indeed\u0026nbsppared down, but still attracted some recognisable names – Bruce Foxton’s post-Paul Weller “From The Jam” outfit, the Charlatans, the Bluetones. The following year brought the Happy Mondays, Echo and the Bunnymen, and local heroes Terrorvision.\u0026nbspBy the time the first headliners the Charlatans returned in 2012, the festival had added a third day on the Friday, and the festival was really on an upward curve.But can a local authority really justify the cost? There are partners of course, including Ticketline, Mercure Hotels and Carlsberg. But surely it doesn’t make any money?According to a Bradford Council reply to a freedom of information request last month asking for income and expenditure on Bingley Music Live over the past three years, in 2015 there was income of £946,000 against just over £1m in costs. In 2016 income was down at £822,000 against very similar costs, but last year, with costs standing at £1.15m, there was gross income of £1.3m… leaving a net surplus of £222,000.Having attended the event last year, those figure’s aren’t surprising. It was packed and money was flowing over the bars and food concessions. It’s also a very family-oriented event. And with ticket sales ensuring 15,000 come through the gates every day this year –\u0026nbspwhich the coup of booking Noel Gallagher has certainly helped with –\u0026nbspit looks likely that Bingley Music Live is on an upward trend.Being in the middle of one of the Bradford district’s big towns as well, rather than in splendid isolation on a field somewhere in Hampshire, there are extra benefits. My council spokesperson says: “The event is a big thing for Bingley’s businesses, with its many excellent pubs, bars, shops and places to eat all busy with people for the full weekend. The festival is also embraced by the local Bradford and Bingley Sports Club who provide camping for festivalgoers on their fields.”Ariana Grande and James Corden perform hit-filled version of TitanicWhy drag queen Vicky Vox is starring in Little Shop of HorrorsCamp Bestival forced to close early due to poor weather conditionsWhile Bingley Music Live might be unusual in being local authority-run, its model of being an “urban festival” is one that is becoming increasingly popular… and can pay idends for local economies.Journalist Claude Lynch, writing in CityMetric earlier this year, said that while the big, camp-out-all-weekend festivals were declining, smaller, urban festivals were thriving… and possibly because of a sense of community. He wrote: “Multiple studies into the dynamics and economics of festivals make similar arguments about how to drive ‘re-patronising’ – in other words, how to make festivalgoers want to come back next year. Evidence suggests that ‘social identification’ – having something in common with other festivalgoers – is often just as important as the quality of the music or the food. Festivals can capitalise on this boon of social identification by offering a self-contained event designed\u0026nbspwith both locals and tourists in mind. Locals are more likely to patronise events that emphasise community spirit while tourists are enthused by events that symbolise and epitomise the local culture.”From very humble beginnings 27 years ago, Bingley Music Live has survived and thrived, often against the odds, and when international superstar Noel Gallagher takes the stage in a couple of weeks’ time, it will be the culmination of the dogged determination that gets things done in this part of the world… and looks like providing the template for the future of live music.For more information go to bingleymusicliveMusic at MyrtleEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo Park"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/14/16/madonna-career-21.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6463721  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= 1984  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/14/16/madonna-career-21.jpg","title":"madonna 60 pop stars middle age patti smith kate bush","story":"Created with Sketch.In most\u0026nbspprofessions,\u0026nbspwomen of a certain age are invisible.

Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/18/12/boris-boris.jpg  width= 2440  height= 1627  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/18/12/boris-boris.jpg","title":"brexit latest superdry peoples vote final say","story":"Created with Sketch.Julian Dunkerton\u0026nbspsays cash will pay for one of UK\u0027s biggest ever polling operationsClick to followIndy PoliticsEntrepreneur behind Superdry fashion label hands £1m to Brexit referendum campaignThe businessman behind the\u0026nbspSuperdry\u0026nbspfashion label is donating £1m to the People’s Vote campaign for a new referendum on Brexit.Julian Dunkerton said he was giving the money because there is “no vision for Brexit” being offered by the government.It will be used to launch one of the biggest polling operations ever undertaken in UK politics, to bolster the campaign for a new public vote.It also comes after The Independent launched its own Final Say campaign to demand a new referendum on the outcome of Brexit, with more than 660,000 having signed the\u0026nbsppetition.Mr Dunkerton explained that Superdry would never have become the global success it did if Brexit had happened 20 years earlier, leading to burdensome customs and tariffs and making it difficult to open stores outside the UK.\u0026nbspHe said: “I’m putting some of my money behind the People’s Vote campaign because we have a genuine chance to turn this around.“I’ve got a good instinct for when a mood is going to change and we’re in one of those moments now.Rees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011“It’s becoming clear now there is no vision for Brexit and the politicians have made a mess of it.

That is why my trade union, Community, is backing\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Final Say\u0026nbspcampaign, to secure a people’s vote on the final deal.”Contribute to the march of a generationAt the last People’s Vote March in June, well over 100,000 people marched on parliament.Community’s roots are in textile manufacturing and the steel industry – pushed to the brink of collapse in recent years as much larger economies such as China distort international markets.In 2018 the industry has faced new pressure in particular from steel tariffs imposed by Donald Trump’s US administration, which Brexiteers are relying on for a favourable future trade deal.Community also supports prison and justice workers, logistics, finance, politics and public affairs staff, the charity and freelance sectors and is affiliated to the Labour\u0026nbspParty.Mr Rickhuss highlighted London School of Economics data concluding Brexit was already costing the average UK household more than £404 a year by June 2017.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline

supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchHe argued that the facts of withdrawal were now “profoundly different to those presented in 2016”, branding the promise of £350m a week for the NHS “worthless” and the guarantee that European trade would not be harmed as “at best a mistake, and at worst a deliberate lie.”The general secretary added: “When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is\u0026nbspgood enough.When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is good enough.\u0026nbsp If that outcome is rejected, then all options should be on the table“If that outcome is rejected, then all options should be on the table, including reopening negotiations with Europe and retaining the status quo.“Community would not shy away from asking our members to vote on important or difficult issues in the workplace our politicians must do the right thing and give the people a Final Say on their future.”The People’s Vote launched in April demanding a referendum on the deal agreed with the EU\u0026nbspand has a grassroots network of around 1 million people, holding rallies and action days across the country.The Independent launched its own Final Say campaign three weeks ago,\u0026nbspso far gathering 615,000 names to its petition along with a string of political endorsements.In June this year more than 100,000 people from all walks of life marched on parliament to demand their democratic voice be heard in a new Brexit referendum.But following the newly forged alliance, the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future, on Saturday 20 October\u0026nbspin London, is set to be much larger.Ireland is closer than ever to unification because of BrexitWhy hasn’t the NHS been prioritised in Brexit negotiations?No-deal Brexit ‘will raise risk of disease outbreaks’Why has John McDonnell’s constituency changed its mind on Brexit?Senior Conservative asks constituents if they want new Brexit voteIt received backing from British film star Dominic West today, who said: “Please sign the petition, join us on our march, and let’s get a people’s vote to say that we won’t be dictated to.”The gathering, with young people whose voices were not heard two years ago at its forefront, will constitute one of the most significant demonstrations in British history – just as Ms May returns from Brussels from a critical Brexit summit.Amatey Doku, vice-president of the 7\u0026nbspmillion-strong National Union of Students and a supporter of the For our Future’s Sake group that backs a new referendum, said: “This Tory government, unfortunately assisted by the Labour Party,\u0026nbspthreaten to harm young people’s futures.Rees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011“That’s why students across the country are coming together for the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future. Students and young people can no longer be ignored – and on 20 October, we won’t be.”The prime minister had once aimed to have a deal agreed with Europe earlier this summer, but with negotiations badly stalling and a major cabinet fallout, expectations turned to the October summit.British ministers privately admit it is now unlikely the UK will be able to agree a deal even by October, with a special summit potentially needed before Christmas – leaving just three months in the new year for the UK and the EU to ratify any agreement.It is also unclear if Ms May will be able to navigate any deal across her party’s deep isions, with the European Research Group of backbench Tory MPs drawing up alternative proposals highlighting the benefits of a no-deal Brexit.An exclusive poll carried out by BMG Research this week found that 48 per cent of the public would now back a vote on any deal struck between the UK and the EU – up from 44 per cent just four weeks ago.Just 24 per cent opposed the idea, down three points over the same period. Only 14 per cent of the 1,500 people surveyed supported Ms May’s chequers deal given a choice.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure

USAlex Jones is being sued by the families of nine Sandy Hook victims for spreading false claims that the 2012 elementary school shooting was a government-backed hoax Lawyers for the families of two Sandy Hook shooting victims are accusing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his Infowars media business of intentionally destroying evidence relevant to the defamation cases against him, according to a motion filed on Friday in a Texas court.Mr Jones is being sued by the families of nine Sandy Hook victims for spreading false claims that the 2012 shooting at the elementary school that killed 20 first-graders and six adults was a government-backed hoax, and that the families of the dead were actors.Mr Jones said on his broadcast last week that he had told his staff to delete material after CNN cited Infowars content that violated Twitter’s policies, according to the motion filed Friday.Mr Jones has been protesting an unprecedented effort this month by Apple, Facebook, YouTube and other services to remove Infowars content from their platforms.At least some of the deleted content was considered evidence in the Sandy Hook cases, and Mr Jones had been informed in writing in April that he was obligated by law to preserve all relevant material, according to the court filing in District Court in Travis County in Austin, Texas.“As pressure mounted from pending defamation lawsuits and growing public indignation, Mr Jones chose to destroy evidence of his actual malice and defamatory conduct,” the motion filed on Friday said.Scenes of shock and devastation at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, ConnecticutPicture from local newspaper the Newtown Bee shows Connecticut State Police lead children from the Sandy Hook Elementary SchoolThe scene outside the primary

Elementary School in Newtown, ConnecticutPicture from local newspaper the Newtown Bee shows Connecticut State Police lead children from the Sandy Hook Elementary SchoolThe scene outside the primary school following the incidentConcerned parents picking up their children following the shootingObama wipes away a tear during the press conferenceThe suit said that it was not known how much content had been deleted, but that it included written social media materials and videos.The motion was filed on behalf of Neil Heslin, father of Jesse Lewis, a 6-year-old killed at Sandy Hook.Over the five years since the shooting, families of the Sandy Hook victims have been stalked, threatened and subjected to online abuse by Jones’ followers, after he spread false claims about the mass shooting, calling it “synthetic, completely fake with actors, in my view, manufactured,” according to documents.Friday’s motion is the latest legal salvo in three separate defamation lawsuits filed by Sandy Hook families, which seek tens of millions of dollars in damages and pose an existential threat to Mr Jones’ business.Should the court find that Mr Jones and Infowars willfully destroyed evidence, he, and possibly his lawyer, could be assessed fines and be subject to punitive action.Most importantly, the material that was destroyed could be presumed by the court as supporting Mr Heslin’s claims against Mr Jones, bolstering his case.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log

Yesterdays employment figures revealed that the proportion of young people unemployed (and not in full-time education) is now at a record low of 4.7% for our country - and far lower than for many other developed countries.It sends a significant message out about the drive and innovation of our young people, and the opportunities that our economy offers to them and their future.With our welfare changes this country can now be powered forward by this young generation.Since 2010, youth unemployment has fallen by over 45%, giving 130,000 more young people a job, and a future.Add the fact that wages are on the up and there are more than 829,000 vacancies nationwide, it’s clear that young people are entering the best jobs market in a decade.On average, the number of vacancies has increased by 4,280 each month over the last year, and those vacancies span from construction to technology.So when young people this week are deciding on their next steps, they can think big as there are plenty of opportunities out there for them, from a job with career progression, to taking up an apprenticeship.Look at Daisy, who turned down five university offers to work at global engineering firm JCB designing new equipment, and she didn’t have to go to university to get there.I’m forever being told, and intrinsically understand, that people want to study at different times in their lives, often inspired to do so when they see the practical benefits of their studies.That’s why so many people prefer, and do better, getting a job first and then studying for exams while they work.Even over the last few decades, how the world of education and work are linked has shifted dramatically. People no longer have one job for life, and lifelong learning is becoming more and more commonplace as people dip in and out of education.Many more people up-skill and retrain throughout their career – and this is how the future jobs market will remain vibrant and strong.And when I speak to employers up and down the country, from manufacturers to marketers, what they want are young people with the right attitude, prepared to work and learn. As they say, ‘if you’ve the will, we can give you the skill’.So when young people this week are deciding their next steps, the academic route isn’t the only option.You can now become a solicitor, an accountant or even a nuclear engineer through the apprenticeship route, earning as you learn and without the cost of going to University. Studying a Higher Apprenticeship gives an average wage boost of £150,000 over a working life.When I speak to young people around the country, I’m impressed with the confidence and self-assuredness with which they look to the future, and the range of options they consider beyond traditional routes.Im certainly no job snob. Life teaches you its not where you come from, its where you get to, and work is exactly the same.You can start anywhere and get to the top as Im repeatedly being told by our countrys top entrepreneurs.Top performers in their fields such as Debbie Moore, Jean-Christophe Novelli, Deborah Meaden and Jo Malone, did not go to university and are just a handful of the individuals who show that with drive and determination you can succeed by treading your own path.Its all about getting a break and taking the opportunities that come your way.So best of luck to everyone today, but whatever your results, there are many opportunities and pathways into a successful career.    Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And our “ally” across the Irish Sea, the rent-a-quote Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, is threatening to ground our planes the day we leave.The silly season is coming to an end but it seems only Britain is getting serious.There is still much to do if, as we suspect, Brussels has no interest in negotiating in good faith. They are so terrified by the collapse of their project, thanks to unrest everywhere from Italy to Poland, that they’re willing to make themselves poorer as a result.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab must get his department moving quicker and force other parts of government to speed up their preparation.But we are finally showing we can go it alone.

Good companies with good profits create good jobs.But they must play by the rules, especially when other firms — such as high street retailers — are struggling.It is still staggering to us that Amazon’s UK tax bill FELL last year despite it almost tripling its profits.The Chancellor must close the costly loopholes that tech giants continue to exploit.WE’RE saying a little prayer for the Queen of Soul.Aretha Franklin redefined the music landscape, her songs influencing everybody from Luther Vandross to Adele.But she also raised huge amounts of money for the civil rights struggle in the US, doing it not for publicity but because she believed in it.Her extraordinary take on Otis Redding’s Respect became an anthem not just for African Americans but for feminists the world over.Rest in peace.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There would be no Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus or arguably Lady Gaga without Madonna.She might not be the best singer or dancer in the world, but she’s certainly the best at just being Madonna.You simply can’t imagine anyone ever telling her what to do. She’d laugh in their face.Madonna had always known how to grab attention, whether it’s publishing a book stuffed full of naked photos of herself, faking self-pleasure on stage, or kissing Britney Spears.And only Madonna could have bounced back from almost being strangled by her bright red Armani cape when she took a tumble and fell on her backside during the Brit Awards three years ago.She merely dusted herself down and carried on regardless, but I bet whoever was in charge of her wardrobe that night would have been given the b******ing of their life.Madonna is always in charge, professionally and personally. Even during her brief fling with aging lothario Warren Beatty, he was very much a bit player in the Madonna Show.That must have badly bruised the ego of a man who had always had the upper-hand in his relationships until then.It has to be said her love life hasn’t been anywhere near as successful as her career.There was a brief, destructive marriage to American actor Sean Penn in the Eighties and in 2000 she married Guy Ritchie, but the couple divorced eight years later.Since then she has dated a string of handsome and often young men, but they usually seemed to have the whiff of a photo opportunity about them rather than anything long term.She chews them up, spits them out and moves on to the next one.Madonna seems happiest as a single mum.She has uprooted the family to Lisbon, in Portugal,  because her adopted son David wants to play professional football.With her vast wealth she could easily have bought him a team such as LA Galaxy but she has always had a Calvinistic work ethic that she has tried to pass on to her kids.She has also made up with son Rocco Ritchie after a bitter custody battle and appears to be in a very good place.In an era where most young female vocalists all sound the same — bored, whiny and more than a wee bit yodelly — we really do need a one-off like Madonna.I hope she had a fabulous birthday on Thursday in Marrakech, Morocco, and danced until dawn to all of her greatest hits.Happy 60th birthday, ma’am, and I’ve no doubt you will still be in your fishnets and basques when you get that 100-year birthday message.Just when the royals and their advisers thought the whole fiasco between Meghan Markle and her dad had gone quiet, there comes a bizarre twist.Meghan’s rent-a-gob half-sister Samantha, who seethes with rage and jealousy, has announced that Thomas Markle is bringing out his own clothing range.This led to speculation as to what the brand might be called.  “Markle \u0026amp Spencer” or “Primarkles”  (thank you, Alan Carr). But joking aside, surely this can’t be a serious  concept.Apart from being a crass, money-grabbing exercise cashing in on a quasi-royal connection, who on earth would buy garments from a pensioner who dresses like a hobo?I’ve had a great deal of sympathy for Thomas  in the past. He was treated poorly in the build-up to the  Royal Wedding, when his daughter married Prince Harry.He should have been embraced by his new family and given guidance on how to deal with the  media attention.Instead he was cast adrift. The result? Those stupid paparazzi set-up photos and a series of interviews that painted Meghan in a poor light.Every time her dad talks on TV or to newspapers and magazines, her popularity is dented.The two of them obviously have a fraught relationship. It turns out Thomas didn’t attend Meghan’s first wedding in 2011 either.Thomas increasingly comes across as bitter, angry and dislikable.To gain media attention he keeps making more and more outrageous accusations.My advice would be to stop listening to his bitchy daughter Samantha and maintain a dignified silence.All thoughts of profiteering through a clothing range or any commercial activity must be abandoned forthwith.That just might mean there could be some  sort of reconciliation in the future.Otherwise he will lose his daughter forever.ONE of the week’s most astonishing stories involved a young US woman who has been given her life back with a groundbreaking face transplant.Three years ago, Katie Stubblefield, from Mississippi in the US, tried to take her own life and shot herself in the face with a hunting rifle. She was just 18.Doctors saved her life but she was left with a mass of scar tissue instead of a face.Katie, the youngest person ever to receive a face transplant, endured more than 30 hours of surgery.Of course, the operation requires a donor – and in this case it is  a very sad story.Katie received the face  of a mum who died of a drug overdose.She was a registered organ donor and her grandmother bravely approved the donation.That decision can’t have been easy and we should always salute those who are donors, and the loved ones who give their consent.Katie won’t look like anything like her donor because the “face” is moulded on to her new bone structure.She continues to heal and  make progress, but this kind of surgery is still in its infancy.She will always look “different” but she has a second chance of life and now wants to help others in anguish and with suicidal thoughts.It’s an incredible story of despair that turned to  hope.  The skill and dedication of the team of surgeons and medics that helped her is awe-inspiring.I’m always surprised to learn that Caroline Flack is 38 years old.The presenter looks a  lot younger – and at the moment she is acting like a lovesick teenager going through the agony and ecstasy of her first serious crush.Her off/on romance with red carpet fever victim Andrew Brady is becoming laughable.This week the couple apparently had yet another spat in a London ­restaurant.If these two are to have any chance of staying together long term, they need to get out of the public eye and spend some quiet time alone.I’m sure Caroline knows of a certain Love Island that isn’t being used right now. That would do very well.The ending of the second series of The Handmaid’s Tale had me shouting in despair at my TV.I don’t want to give away too many spoilers but this cliffhanger will break your heart.It also, however, sets up season three for long overdue revenge.As always, astonishing performances from Elisabeth Moss as  June/Ofglen and Yvonne Strahovski as Serena Joy.They will soon fight it out for real when the TV actress awards are up for grabs.I’ve lost track of the amount of slippers our border terrier puppy Angus has chewed up, but this week he surpassed himself by getting his paws on his Pet Passport and virtually destroying it when we were in Spain.Luckily a  local vet issued him with a Spanish version and he now boasts dual nationality.He’s suddenly developed a liking for an afternoon siesta, but at least we were able to get him back into the UK – although who knows what will happen to him after Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What was a “smear” yesterday is a forgotten truth today, airbrushed from history because, well, that’s the way these people do these things.The new line is Jeremy wants to see “a fitting memorial to everyone who died in every terrorist incident everywhere”.I dare say he’ll be visiting Enniskillen soon. Of course.And yet, in one sense there really isn’t very much to look at. Or, rather, very little that is new. This is who Corbyn is and who he has always been.He has never bothered hiding this, leaving one to assume he only does so now because there is some small, nagging part of his brain which accepts it might be sensible to do so, since failing to hide it might prove politically inconvenient.Even so, he cannot change. Anyone who has been at university will recognise Corbyn and all his fellow travellers.These were the people — some of them clever but not many of them intelligent — who fouled student politics for everyone else.The chiselling parsers and pedants and revolutionaries whose appetite for procedural minutiae bored everyone else into submission.And usually that would be that. They would, most of them, grow up eventually. But not St Jeremy and not his devotional disciples, either.They are greyer now but as instantly recognisable as they always were: Experts in room-clearing.They ought, by rights, to be confined to dingy rooms above down-at-heel pubs, where they could cut and paste their thuddingly dreary newsletters. Instead, mystifyingly, they have been given control of one of Britain’s great political parties.How much will this summer of anti-Semitism really cut through with the average voter? Less than you might think, I suspect.In the first place — and this may be a good thing — Twitter remains a niche platform and political Twitter a niche even there.Secondly, the public have already made up their minds about Corbyn and they think he’s a dud.Each month YouGov asks whether Jeremy Corbyn or Theresa May seems the best available Prime Minister and each month Corbyn trails.Sometimes he is also beaten by “Don’t know”. That’s Corbyn: He can come third in a two-horse race.But, they splutter, look at what a kind and gentle and decent man he is. Why can’t other people see that he’s a valiant activist for peace?Possibly because, for a decent fellow, he spends a startling amount of time with thoroughly indecent people.He keeps falling in with the wrong crowd while never being a member of the wrong crowd himself. There is no need here to document the long list of unsavoury people with whom Corbyn has been happy to associate himself because, really, what is now the point? He is who he is and we know who he is.In Corbyn’s world every-thing has a single, simple explanation. Colonialism is the root cause of all root causes.That insight — if we can call it that — dictated his views on Ireland just as it dictates his views on the Middle East, Cuba, Venezuela and everywhere else.From there it is but a short leap to the kind of deluded wishful thinking that animates what passes for his thinking. Once you have assumed that Northern Ireland should not exist, you absolve yourself of any and all need to think about what should happen next.You may ignore the inconvenient, and stubborn, reality that Northern Ireland — like, well, Israel — does exist and is not going to disappear.Practical politics means wrestling with things as they are, not as you think they should have been decades previously.But if you start with the theory, you may avoid practical reality. If this leaves you with nothing — precisely nothing — useful to say then so be it. You will at least remain pure in heart.If this means you are no kind of “peace campaigner” at all, that’s fine too, because you will be shielded by your own impenetrable sanctimony.As poses go, this is an awfully comfortable one but it’s not serious politics.Perhaps Corbyn really is just unlucky. But it seems more probable that he’s not. And that, far from being the decent man of legend he’s actually thoroughly indecent.The only possible alternative is that he’s thunderously, crushingly, toe-curlingly thick.On balance, however, it seems more probable that he is, in fact, both.Enough of this. Enough, already.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250 or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But she was appointed to her job by the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) which has links with Putins party.FPO leader and Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache, who joined Austrias governing coalition last year, praised her as a bridge builder as he congratulated the couple and wished them all the luck in the world and eternal love!The international coverage of the visit would bring priceless publicity, he added. A better advertisement for Austria, it’s wonderful nature, dreamlike landscape and real life hospitality cannot exist!Joerg Leichtfried from the opposition Social Democrats tweeted that Austrias current presidency of the Council of the European Union put it in an especially delicate spot given tensions between Putin and the West.All the more symbolic and harmful to court the Russian president in this manner, he said.Austrias governing coalition - led by the conservatives of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who also attended the wedding - has presented itself as a bridge builder with Moscow.It says it shares the EUs foreign policy stance, but did not follow other members of the bloc in expelling Russian diplomats after Britain accused Russia of involvement in the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in England - a charge Moscow denies.Putin is due to travel to Germany later on Saturday to meet Chancellor Angela Merkel for talks about Syria, Ukraine and energy at the governments Meseberg palace outside Berlin."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000427475709.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"rose west pampered behind bars","story":"The 64-year-old was said to have completed ­sewing tasks for other cons.She even put up a sign outside, proudly saying “Threads”.But the inmate changed it to read “Freds” — after Rose’s late serial killer husband Fred West.The couple were responsible for the murder and torture of ten women in their house of horrors in Gloucester.But the lag said Rose was treated like a celeb by staff in HMP Durham — before both were switched to HMP Low Newton.Ex-con Katherine Jones, 52, said: “It made me sick to see how much they pampered this vile monster.“The staff gave her a little office on the wing and she put up a sign saying ‘Threads’.“But I changed it to ‘Fred’s’ — I don’t think she was happy about it.

subs","story":"Crowds packed into Portsmouth harbour to wave Big Lizzie goodbye from Portsmouth Naval Base this evening, as US fighter jets prepare to land on board for the very first time.The £3billion carrier will be accompanied by 1,500 sailors, aircrew and marines as it carries out flight trials and encompasses a visit to New York on a nearly three-month voyage.Commodore Andrew Betton, commander of the UK Carrier Strike Group, said they would operate professionally and within the standard laws of the high seas.He said: Russian submarines are more active in the North Atlantic than they have been since the Cold War and we take that very seriously, the ship will be well protected as she makes her transit across the Atlantic.We are not seeking confrontation, we are heading to the east coast of the United States to conduct trials.Over the course of its trip, the £3billion warship will embark two US F-35B test aircraft based at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, which are expected to carry out 500 landings and take-offs during the carriers 11 weeks at sea.Captain Jerry Kyd, the carriers commanding officer, said: The increase in Russian activity we have seen in the last couple of years is frightening and for national security reasons it just underlines why we need to maintain a balanced, strong and able, capable fleet.Its been quite eye-watering what we have seen in the last couple of years.Capt Kyd said: This deployment to the United States will be another first for my ship.It has been an incredible journey since we left Rosyth just over a year ago and we are all looking forward to this next seminal chapter in HMS Queen Elizabeths life.He added: People are looking forward to seeing the jets because we have been talking about them for flipping years.Theres a lot of excitement on board.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: HMS Queen Elizabeth is a true statement of our national power and the whole country can be proud to see this magnificent symbol of our engineering prowess and international ambition leaving port to sail on to the world stage.Her voyage to America not only shows her global reach but strengthens our special relationship with the US forces who we have worked hand-in-hand with on this iconic programme.As she sails along the east coast of the USA, she will signal our determination to keep fighting alongside our allies in all corners of an ever more complex and uncertain world.The honour of landing the first of the training jets on to the carrier will go to one of three British pilots taking part in the US deployment.They are a Royal Navy commander, an RAF squadron leader and a civilian test pilot accompanied by a major from the US Marine Corps.Cdre Betton added: These first F-35B embarked trials in a UK aircraft carrier are not only key to future operational success but represent an iconic moment for the modern Royal Navy.On leaving Portsmouth, HMS Queen Elizabeth will carry out tests in UK waters before heading across the Atlantic to the US where as well as the tests, she will visit New York.She will be joined by support ship RFA Tiderace and Plymouth-based Type-23 frigate HMS Monmouth as well as Merlin MK2 helicopters from 820 Naval Air Squadron, RNAS Culdrose, Mk 4 Merlins from 845 Naval Air Squadron, RNAS Yeovilton, and Royal Marines from 42 Commando, Plymouth.The first of the UKs joint Royal Navy and RAF F-35B supersonic jets arrived from America in June and are based at RAF Marham in Norfolk.Testing with these British aircraft is expected to take place on board HMS Queen Elizabeth next year.She has already undergone training with helicopters which have carried out more than 1,000 take-offs and landings.The carrier is expected to embark on its first operational deployment in 2021."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000388775551-e1534623242596.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"battered businesses shoppers good

week after retail expert Joshua Bamfield warned that 250,000 jobs were at risk unless moves are made to save traditional town centres.Campaigners have asked for an overhaul of business rates as stores such as Toys R Us and electronic store Maplin have closed their doors this year.But High Streets Minister Jake Berry MP last night said: “Special events from food markets to fetes are great opportunities to bring local communities together to celebrate all that’s great about the high street and get more customers through the door.“We want to encourage as many communities as possible to be creating a buzz on their local high street and not be put off by bureaucracy.“This easy to follow guidance shows the simple steps needed to close a high street to bring in more customers and keep

He’s got the money and the fame, he’s happy and he doesn’t care who he hurts in the process.“He’s just a spoilt kiddie who is used to people pandering to him.”Stokes, 27, was last week cleared of affray despite CCTV footage showing him knock out two revellers on a Sunday night in Bristol after a one-day victory over West Indies.But dad-of-four Andy, 37, said: “If he had been charged with something else he would have been convicted.“If it was me in court for that, I would be in prison now, my feet wouldn’t have touched the ground.”Andy recalled how Stokes and England teammate Alex Hales asked in vain to be let into the Mbargo club after 2am.They even offered him £300, which he refused.He said: “I didn’t know who they were, I’m not a cricket fan. I said, Sorry guys, it’s shut.’Stokes pulled out £60 and I said, ‘Sorry that won’t get you in.’“His mate pulled a wallet out and between them they offered £300. I told him they couldn’t come in.“I could have taken the money but then I would never work again.“Stokes started to get more irate. He was angry. It doesn’t matter who you are, you could be The Pope, you’re not getting in after 2am.“We often get celebrities, people like Alan Carr, TV stars, rugby players. Most are humble and are polite and nice but Stokes didn’t like being told No.“Hales didn’t want to interact. He was like a yes man to Stokes, whatever Stokes said he went along with it. It was like he was his b***h. He looked scared around him.”Andy, who used to do security at cage fighting matches, has been a doorman in Bristol for five years after moving from Chelmsford, Essex.He said 90 per cent of his body is tattooed and spent £2,500 on gold teeth to replace ones lost playing rugby and in an accident.The teetotaller, who lives in Weston-super-Mare, said: “I was still being respectful and polite to him and then he noticed my teeth.“He said to me ‘Look at the state of your teeth, they make you look like a c***.’ I just said,‘ Thank you’.“I’ve got the skin of a rhino. I don’t shout and I’m not an angry person.“Stokes carried on muttering to himself and talking to Hales. He then said, ‘Well look at your s*** tattoos too, look at your job, look at what you’re doing’.“I replied, ‘Yeah keeping people like you out.’“I wasn’t getting wound up by it. But he was getting angry. I don’t think it was the drink making him like that. It’s just his personality.” The CCTV footage showed Stokes appear to flick a cigarette at another clubber, Billy O’Connor, but Stokes denied this in court.Andy, who is 6ft 4in and 19st, said: “I got a bit annoyed and said, ‘If you want to fight someone, fight me.’“He wouldn’t look me in the eye after that. After about 20 minutes of abuse and him taking the p*** out of people, he came over to shake hands with me.“I said, ‘We’ve got no reason to shake hands.’ Stokes was furious.”Andy went on: “I referred to him in court as the ginger one because I couldn’t remember everyone’s names and I’ve been given flak for that.“People walking or driving past the club — mostly middle-aged overweight cricket fans, young kids shouting abuse from the other side of the road . . . it’s comical.”Durham star Stokes was accused of affray along with clubber Ryan Hale, 27, and his pal Ryan Ali, 28. Batsman Hales was not charged.Stokes and Ali were cleared following a six-day trial at Bristol crown court. Mr Hale was acquitted the week before.Before the bust-up, Stokes was said to have made homophobic against Billy and his friend Kai Barry.Neither were called to give evidence.But after the trial they told The Sun they had swapped banter with Stokes before he defended them from being attacked.However Andy insisted: “If he wasn’t guilty of affray, CCTV shows he is still guilty of attacking a man who was retreating. You can’t justify that.” Andy, whose youngest child has brain damage, said he was “very nervous” about giving evidence and added: “I’m not a public speaker, I don’t normally speak to audiences.”His wife Gemma, 34, sat in the court public gallery to support him.She said she spotted Stokes’ wife Clare, mother to his two children.Gemma added: “Clare Stokes was sitting right there and she was dismissing everything that Andy was saying, shaking her head and huffing and puffing. She didn’t want to believe what Andy was saying.”Now Andy says he would be happy to fight Stokes in a boxing ring for charity.He said: “If he wants to punch someone he can have a go at me. I would be happy to meet him in a charity boxing ring.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Those who have are mostly Remainers who would now vote Leave.Many people are deeply sceptical about the tedious stumbling blocks that have bogged down the process.Almost half — 48 per cent — think the political classes are deliberately making heavy weather of Brexit in the hope it will convince the public to change their minds.Six in ten believe the EU is out to punish the UK by refusing to compromise in talks on trade and free movement, our Deltapoll survey says.But the vast majority are convinced a departure deal will be hammered out in the end, even if it takes longer than expected.Former Cabinet minister Priti Patel last night said: “The Sun on Sunday’s poll shows that the British people ultimately believe we can build a stronger future for our country outside the EU.Nearly half of adults believe the weather goes in cycles and that heatwaves come around from time to time.Barely a third of voters believe the human race is responsible and that we will have more extreme temperatures unless we act soon.Our poll found that a majority of 18 to 24-year-olds blame global warming for the hottest British summer since 1976.But in every other age group, most people think it has little or nothing to do with climate change.Six in ten over-55s believe it was “just another hot summer”.“It is clear that most people are sick to the back teeth of being ­bullied by the EU and listening to politicians at home erecting all kinds of obstacles to prevent them honouring the referendum result.“The Government should sit up and heed the results of this poll. That means being tougher in negotiations with Brussels and doing what the nation voted for — to get Britain out of the EU.”Most people — 55 per cent — are against a second in-out referendum, according to our poll.Forty per cent think we should just leave in 222 days’ time as planned with or without a deal.Fifteen per cent want a vote on the final deal, but not a re-run on whether or not Britain leaves the EU.Overall, only 13 per cent have changed their minds on Brexit since the referendum on June 23, 2016. Most of those were once Remainers. Fifteen per cent of them admit to having shifted their view — equivalent to 2.4 million people.That compares with just 11 per cent of Brexit backers, 1.9 million, who have had a rethink.Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said the poll had “nailed the lie” that many people regret voting Leave.Deltapoll director Martin Boon said the findings show most people are taking a tougher stance on Brexit.He added: “Half the public believe themselves to be under siege from the political classes trying to change their minds.“But the message they are sending back is that they haven’t changed their minds and the likelihood is they won’t.”Voters are evenly divided on whether there will be a hard border after Brexit. Twenty-two per cent say there will, 21 per cent say otherwise.There is also a split over whether leaving the EU will prove a historic mistake. Forty-four per cent think it will, 30 per cent believe it will not. One statement united 59 per cent of voters — “I’m really bored by Brexit.”Separately, our poll found that most people think former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was right to raise the difficult and sensitive issue of women wearing burkas. Two-thirds believe he was right to start a debate about the Muslim veil.But some say he should say sorry because he went “over the top” by comparing wearers to “bank robbers” or “letterboxes”. Half of Tory supporters and 36 per cent of all voters believe his remarks were right and he has nothing to apologise for.A further 28 per cent say he went a little too far with his language and should admit it.He gets no support from 23 per cent, who say his remarks were offensive and he should say sorry.Deltapoll interviewed an online sample of 1,904 adults aged 18+ from August 14 to 16. Results have been weighted to the profile of all GB adults.The Labour leader has defied the odds after damaging revelations about the friends he keeps.Half of voters believe Labour has a problem with anti-Semitism. More than a third say Mr Corbyn is part of that problem.But a Sun on Sunday Deltapoll has Labour three points ahead of the Tories.If there were an election tomorrow, Labour would be 31 seats short of a majority but with enough MPs to form a government with Scottish Nationalist support.Tory backing has been sapped as traditional supporters switch to Ukip in protest over the PM’s weak handling of Brexit.There is little to celebrate for any of the party leaders who all get negative popularity ratings.Mr Corbyn scores minus 35, while Theresa May is on minus 26 — only two points better than floundering Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable.Today, a Sun on Sunday poll shows that idea to be total codswallop.Voters simply want our politicians to get on with delivering Brexit.The majority of people have not changed their mind since the referendum.Our poll shows those that have are mostly Remainers who would now vote Leave.Project Fear has never worked, and it is not going to suddenly start working now. The public are wise to it.Our poll makes it clear that fudging Brexit would unleash serious anger among the electorate. The Government should take notice.Almost half of voters already reckon that the political classes in Britain are making heavy weather of Brexit, in the vain and misguided belief that they can get the public to change their mind.Meanwhile, the drop in support for Theresa May in the polls and Ukip’s rise is a further indication of what the public thought of her Chequers proposals.Millions more will abandon the Tories if Brexit ends up being fudged.Remoaners and Brussels have done their best since the Leave vote to make us think we made a terrible mistake and that the cards are stacked in the EU’s favour.Well, today’s poll is clear.We didn’t and they’re not.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even those of us who will never hit the big time have an Instagram audience waiting to “like” our every selfie.So this is just the logical next step towards making cosmetic surgery available to the masses, rather than the few.Some have argued that Superdrug Botox is actually a good thing, because it bridges the gap between the elite Harley Street options — where you pay several hundred pounds for an appointment with an “aesthetic doctor” — and the more backstreet treatments carried out by hairdressers with just a few hours of training.I disagree. Being able to buy a syringe or two of Botox when you are out shopping for your hairspray legitimises — and normalises — the act of injecting poison in your skin in the name of beauty.Being able to buy Botox over the counter, so to speak, makes it seem like no big deal — just another tick in the “maintenance” box, and as reasonable as tinting your lashes or getting your ears pierced.And that is the problem. All decisions we make about our appearance boil down to personal choice. And if it makes someone feel better to tinker cosmetically or surgically with their natural looks, that’s their choice. No one should judge them for it.But there is a wider problem.Increasingly, women think that whatever they look like naturally isn’t good enough. More and more, the “solution” is invasive cosmetic enhancement.A mainstream shop making Botox available for less than 100 quid is surely only going to add to the pressure some women feel to change their appearance using more than just make-up.Superdrug presents itself as responsible because it will refuse to treat under-25s, when other clinics will.That is shocking — not so much that some clinics WILL treat under-25s but that anyone so young could think they need Botox.You can’t blame Superdrug for this epidemic. It is simple supply and demand.The question is: Why the growing desire among women to look frozen?It’s not like you can get away with saying you’ve not had it when you have, because it’s so obvious.I’ve got a friend whose husband jokes that she needs to hold up little signs saying “happy” or “angry” when she feels an emotion, since her face is so paralysed by botulism.While I’m a big believer in your body, your choice, I’m also a believer in scratching the right itch.The truth is if you feel good about yourself, you look good. If you feel bad and lack confidence, nothing, no amount of Botox or fillers, will ever change that.Just look at Meg from Love Island, above, who, even after an estimated £40,000 worth of plastic surgery, is still massively insecure.Because it’s not what’s on the outside that counts, it’s what’s on the inside.The problem is our society tends to give far too much weight to the outside. That is especially the case for women, but increasingly for men, too.I realise all of this is easy to say, harder to act on. I’m as susceptible as the next person to comparing myself with ­others more beautiful — and possibly more airbrushed — and finding myself lacking.I’m just glad that, when that happens, I know the thing that will make me feel better is far more likely to be self-acceptance than Botox.After all, if you tighten a prune you don’t get a grape — you just get a tight prune!So the really big question is, how to achieve self-acceptance when we are surrounded by all these images of perfection?Well, we are all on our own journey with that one but I’ve got some suggestions which might help.The first is to focus on what you have, rather than what you don’t. And the second is to never, ever compare yourself to anyone else.Forget Botox, you can have that advice for free.You’re welcome.We all enjoyed cheering on the Three Lions players that would quickly become our heroes during the World Cup in Russia this summer.Sadly, those heady days are over and we were reminded of the seamier side of sport this week with the arrest of England rugby union ace Danny Cipriani.His embarrassing brawl outside a Jersey nightclub came hot on the heels of England cricket’s Ben Stokes’ trial over his clash with two men during a night out.Stokes was cleared, but what links these sorry sagas is our drinking culture, which dictates that consuming excessive amounts of alcohol is a normal way of letting off steam.Sportsmen are supposed to be role models, as they influence young people and need to keep themselves in good physical shape.But as long as we think it is OK to binge and push our bodies to the limits rather than sip a few drinks, then violence, injuries and stupid mistakes will continue to be a regular feature of our nights out.And if you are an England sports star, then public shame is just one of the tragic consequences – along with the end of your career – that you might have to face.Why should anyone be surprised at the news that sexual harassment in the police force is rife?Let’s face it, it happens everywhere. So why should the police be any exception?I thought they might hold themselves to higher standards. But no.A new survey reveals that dirty jokes, inappropriate touching, leering and being pressured to have sex are daily issues for many police staff.In a survey of almost 1,800 police staff in England, Wales and Scotland, half had heard sexualised jokes and one in five had received a sexually explicit email or text from a colleague.Shockingly, one in five had also been touched in a way that made them feel uncomfortable.Our head of police at West Ham is a woman.She is smart, tough, brave and would never put up with this type of behaviour.Part of the problem is that many women accept these actions as “normal” and don’t even know how to object. We must learn to stop putting up with it.But it is much more important that men learn what is OK and what is not.End of.Jacinda Ardern – the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who has continued to work since becoming a mother in June – was criticised this week for “using her baby as a prop” after she was seen breastfeeding her daughter at a public meeting.I guess whoever coined that phrase has never had the experience of looking after a baby who needs to be fed – right NOW.Nor will they have dealt with the very loud consequences of that failing to happen.Instead, what about congratulating Jacinda on doing such a great job of being a working mum?We said farewell to two legends last week, let’s remember them with this wonderful meme....So interesting that the day after A-level results arrived, more than 26,000 university places were still available.An Ipsos Mori poll found that while most students still think university is “important”, that is down from 86 per cent five years ago to 75 per cent now.Since a degree is expensive – and no guarantee of a job – you can see why people are questioning the validity of one.However, there is no viable alternative.There are just 10,000 degree-level apprenticeships available, compared with 300,000 university places, according to Sir Peter Lampl, of the Sutton Trust.We need to think how we prepare young people for work and we need more technical qualifications at degree level that offer the chance of a bright future.GOT a story?

The Jewish Labour Movement was scheduled to host the lessons at next month’s party conference in Liverpool. But the group claims Labour’s leadership wants to “censor” their talks on what constitutes anti-Jewish conduct. A letter sent by Ivor Caplin, the JLM chair, to Jennie Formby, Labour’s general secretary, accuses the party of “unacceptable” interference. One source admitted: “This row has put Corbyn’s relationship with the largest Jewish group in the party at breaking point.  “It goes to the very heart of the clash between the leadership and most of Britain’s Jewish community. “It shows that, despite indications the problem was starting to be resolved, the sides are still miles apart.” Sources have confirmed that the biggest area of dispute was over whether the state of Israel could be described as a “racist endeavour”. The JLM argue it is wrong to suggest Israel is racist because of its historic link to the Jewish people. Labour leader Mr Corbyn has argued that it is possible to be anti-Zionist without being anti-semitic. The JLM, whose parliamentary chair is Luciana Berger MP, has hosted training in how to avoid being anti-semitic at the last three Labour conferences. The move was part of an attempt to crack down on anti-Jewish conduct among some members.

Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright is being lined up to follow in the footsteps of Tupac, Freddie Mercury, Michael Jackson and Princess Leia at this year’s Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham. The newly minted Culture and digital boss is notoriously technophobic. During more than 13 years in Parliament, prior to being made Culture Secretary, he said the word “digital” twice.  And before taking the job, his official Twitter account had only five tweets, including retweets.  But according to the Sunday Times, he’s set to embrace the future of…well, Coachella 2012, and deliver his keynote at the party’s annual gathering in virtual form.  Perhaps the oddest thing about the idea, cooked up by his predecessor Matt Hancock before he was promoted to Health Secretary - is that there’s really no reason for it. Where holograms have been used in the past, it’s been for reasons of death or intergalactic civil war. But unless a Tory Secretary of State has taken the unusual step of double booking himself the week of conference, he’ll just…be there anyway. He could even watch his own speech from the audience.  A source close to Mr Wright told the Times: “He understands the need to embrace this kind of developing technology.” If the effect is created in the same way as previous on-stage holograms, the developing technology is a technique known as Pepper\u0027s Ghost - developed by Henry Pepper in 1862. The trick uses glass and projections to create the illusion of a ghostly object or figure appearing on stage. It\u0027s been used frequently in Disneyland theme parks since the 1950s. Of course, there is one member of the party who might wish she could have delivered her speech remotely last year.

The weeks went by and I didn’t get better. I’d lie with my head on the desk in lessons, unable to move from the exhaustion. I was sleeping a lot, I had pain in the back of my legs and I’d feel sensitive to everything.  The first time I knew something was really wrong was when I couldn’t get up the stairs at school. I had to stop three times and I’d drop something so I could pretend I had a reason to pause. I tried to carry on, thinking, ‘It’ll go away’. I didn’t want to be ill, I wanted to live like a normal teenager.  I’d even try to hide it from my parents – I’d say I was upstairs doing homework when really I’d be asleep – but it got to a point where I couldn’t disguise how bad things were. The doctor just prescribed painkillers and I was told to fight it. But gradually my world began to shut down. I had to stop going to school, and as the days went on I became more and more isolated. At first I’d sit on the sofa with the curtains open, then the curtains were shut, then I’d have to wear dark glasses as well. Then I couldn’t go downstairs any more, I was in my bedroom, unable to get out. I went from being incredibly active to having nothing in six months. It was terrifying. And I still didn’t have a clue what was wrong with me. I was finally referred to a paediatrician who diagnosed me with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and a month later I saw a physiotherapist who called an ambulance she was so shocked at the sight of me. I’d had virus upon virus, including a throat infection that had killed my appetite so I was malnourished.  I went to hospital, and little did I know I’d be there for the next four years. My body just went, ‘I can’t do this any more’. I stopped being able to speak, move, eat, or talk. It was a state of semi coma, existing but not really alive. The endless days passed by with me lying there in a broken body, not thinking or listening, my brain gone. It carried on that way for two years Fighting for life The doctors told my family it was the most extreme case of M.E. they’d ever seen and there was nothing they could do. There were so many times my parents were told I may not make it through the night. They spent every night at the hospital because I couldn’t communicate or even press a buzzer, and if friends came to the hospital they’d stand there crying. But slowly my mind became more active and I started to fight for my life. It was literally an hour-by-hour struggle. I didn’t fully understand what was wrong with me, I just knew I had to make it through the day.  It was incredibly difficult, but I might get five minutes’ worth of energy a day, so I’d try to communicate to my parents – if I wanted a drink, I’d make a small whispering sound and movement to tell them what I wanted. It took all my energy learning to speak again, but eventually I got my voice back.  What kept my mind sane through it all was the thought that one day I would write a book about it.  My gran, who I sadly lost 10 years ago, was my inspiration and she would come to hospital and whisper in my ear, ‘That book, we’re going to write it one day and we’ll tell your story.’  "},{"url":null,"title":"i went university 61 fulfil","story":"News\u0027I went to university at 61 to fulfil my dream of becoming a fashion designer\u0027For Susan Campbell, now 65, age didn\u0027t hold her back from pursuing a life-long passion...Share\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByRosie Hopegood07:00, 19 AUG 2018NewsSusan pursued her passion (Image: University of Northampton)Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSusan Campbell can hardly believe that models are strutting down the catwalk wearing her designs.

However, life got in the way of taking her fashion dreams any further. When her children Tom and Laura, now in their 30s, were little, she relished the opportunity to make them sweet little outfits.  It was easy as they were so small and it didn’t take much fabric, she laughs. But it just didn’t occur to me that I could do this for a job.  Instead, Susan worked as everything from a waitress to a cook in an old people’s home, before getting a job as a note-taker at a charity.  When government cuts meant the charity had to reduce my days, I thought I’d use the opportunity to take up an A-level on my extra day off, and of course I chose Textiles, she says.  I remember thinking, \u0027At last, I know what I want to do with myself, I want to be creative.\u0027 But after her first year of study, the local college decided to drop the subject from the syllabus.  I was so upset as I was enjoying it so much – I thought, \u0027I’ve got to find a way to carry this on.\u0027  Susan found an HND in fashion and textiles that sounded perfect but there was one big drawback – she’d have to give up her job. It was a really tough decision because I’ve always worked, but I really didn’t want to stop designing either. Taking the leap So at the age of 61, Susan quit her job to pursue her passion. Her husband Duncan was supportive and she took out a student loan to fund her studies.  I loved learning all the different techniques like quilting, batik, pattern making, she says.  I felt I was in my element, and getting my hands dirty with bleach and dyes, I’d never felt happier. At the end of the HND, Susan knew she couldn’t stop, and after an open day at the University of Northampton, she signed up to do a degree in fashion.  I was terrified on my first day, and hid behind the door, she says.  It was decades since I’d last been in full-time education, and I was worried what the other students, all in their 20s, would think of me. But I couldn’t have had a nicer group, and no one ever made me feel like I was any different.

Smelly, freezing accommodation with no drinking or hot water and broken taps were just some of ghastly features faced by Jon Stroud and Luke Bather, both 28. The pals had picked hotels slammed by online review site TripAdvisor and have posted their short films on YouTube. They paid \u0026pound42 for a triple room in January at Blackpool’s “basic” but \u0026shy“comfortable” Singleton House Hotel. But the hotelier moved them to a room at nearby Casa Seashell which Jon said smelled musty and was freezing. He recalled: “When I turned on the tap, it came away in my hand. We complained and they gave us another room just as bad.” He slept fully clothed on top of his ski jacket on the dirty duvet.  Jon said: “No one else was about, which made it feel like a horror movie. We \u0026shyassume people are giving it a wide berth after reading the awful reviews.” They also stayed in Birmingham’s Norfolk Inn. The third episode of The Worst Hotel? at a Manchester hotel, is online on Sunday. Jon said: “Of the three, Blackpool was the worst, with no heating or hot water and lead pipes making the water undrinkable.” The Norfolk Inn gets 1.5 stars on TripAdvisor. One reviewer complaining it was dirty, rundown with “rude staff” . But despite a pool of sick left in the foyer for two hours and a view of a pipe from their room, Jon and Luke said it was not as bad as suggested. They gave it 2.5 stars.

In the bizarre clip, the flight attendant, whose name badge is visible, holds the tights and two pairs of shoes to her nose and says: “I wish you could smell this.” She talks about just having made a flight knickerless, then teasingly goes on to unbutton her blouse to reveal cleavage before blowing a kiss. The air hostess was grounded by horrified BA bosses after the clip began to be circulated. A source said: “It was doing the rounds and they hit the roof.” It is not known why the woman made the film. But there is a thriving market in hard-up staff from other unidentified airlines flogging worn tights and shoes to fetishists on eBay.  The video passed to the Sunday Mirror shows the woman saying: “Don’t look at how rough I look after the flight. “So you want me to smell my shoes and my tights? Well, first of all, I’ve got to take the tights off.” She then slides them down her legs before ripping off her lanyard and continuing: “These I’ve been wearing all day, with no knickers, just for you.” Burying her nose in the tights, she inhales before throwing them aside and holding up two pairs of black shoes. She says: “I wasn’t sure what shoes you wanted me to smell, so I got both.” Closing her eyes, she sniffs each and says: “Oh, I wish you could smell this.” Then she starts undoing her blouse and adds: “And I wish you were here to carry on unbuttoning my shirt. See you soon.” She ends with the kiss. There is no indication the hostess sold either the video or the garments. But dozens of other cabin crew do sell such items online to boost their salaries.  Bids start at less than \u0026pound10 for a pair of used tights on eBay, with garments worn on long-haul flights fetching the highest prices from foot fetishists. A cabin crew source said: “It is well known for some staff to supplement their income by selling their old work clothes. A lot of us simply can’t live on the wages we’re paid. “The longer the flight the more people seem willing to pay for them. Sometimes they go for \u0026pound50. I heard one girl got \u0026pound80.”  In the ads, sellers hide their faces and do not disclose which airlines they fly for. But they post photos of their stockinged feet and legs aboard planes to prove they are genuine. One ad for used tights says: “Worn on long haul flight to Bangkok and back 24+ hours. Laddered slightly.”  Another offers a pair “worn on two long haul flights.” A third advertises “longhaul USA Singapore Argentina. Worn. Used. Sealed in an airtight bag.” Some sellers say the hosiery has been washed to “eBay standards” – but some follow the claim with a winking emoji or invite users to message them directly for “more details” or “extras”.

Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said he was very concerned to hear allegations that remains of four ships lying off the Malaysian and Indonesian coasts have been looted.  It comes after six wrecks, including Royal Navy battleships HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse, were feared to have been damaged or destroyed by scavengers. Altogether the wrecks are thought to be the final resting place for hundreds of Royal Navy sailors and civilians. Mr Williams said the Government absolutely condemns the unauthorised disturbance of any wreck containing human remains.  I am very concerned to hear any allegations of incidents of Royal Navy wrecks being plundered in the Far East, he said. We will work closely with the Indonesian and Malaysian governments to investigate these claims.  The Mail on Sunday said wrecks of HMS Tien Kwang, HMS Kuala, HMS Banka and SS Loch Ranza had recently been targeted by thieves for their metal.  HMS Tien Kwang, a submarine chaser, and HMS Kuala, an auxiliary patrol vessel, were carrying hundreds of evacuees when they were attacked by Japanese bombers near the Indonesian Riau Islands on February 1942. Earlier that month the SS Loch Ranza, a cargo ship, had been set on fire in a Japanese air raid off the Riau Islands and exploded, killing seven men.

Bob Coughtrey helped obsessed Donna Hartley through her test in six weeks. She then started a terrifying campaign.  He has been forced to move house and install CCTV . And he has counselling over fears she will track him down again.  Hartley, 29, got a suspended sentence last August after bombarding Bob with texts and turning up at his home. Within 12 months, she was convicted again after threatening to kill him – but got another suspended sentence. Bob, from Lincolnshire, said: “I’m always on edge in public, looking for a safe place and quick exit. I want to feel safe.  “What will it take for Donna to be jailed? She made my life hell and showed no regard for the first sentence. It makes a farce of the whole justice system.” He is backing the Sunday People’s campaign for a national stalkers register, adding: “I will do all I can for stalking to be taken more seriously.” Bob’s ordeal began after Hartley passed her test in June 2017 and messaged him saying she wished she had failed so they could spend more time together. “I didn’t reply but she sent loads of messages, some of which threatened self-harm,” he said.  Bob called the police , who went to check she was OK – and he was asked to call and get Hartley to let them in. He said: “I reluctantly agreed. Engaging with her was what I wanted to avoid.”  Hartley kept texting, calling and visiting his Lancashire home. She asked to meet and hug him. One text read: “I don’t want to hurt you but you can hurt me.”  She was arrested in August 2017 after turning up at his home and threatening suicide. She admitted stalking at Blackpool magistrates court and got an indefinite restraining order, plus eight weeks’ jail, suspended for 18 months, and 20 days’ rehabilitation. Bob thought the ordeal was over – until police contacted him in June. He said: “Donna told her psychiatrist she wanted to hold me hostage, torture me with a knife and kill me. I went stone cold.” As she re-offended within her suspended term, Bob assumed Hartley would be jailed or sectioned by Blackpool magistrates last month. But she got 16 weeks’ jail, suspended for two years. “I couldn’t believe it,” said Bob. “While she walks free, I don’t feel safe. The law has failed to protect me.” "},{"url":null,"title":"family 11 split up across","story":"NewsFamily-of-11 split up across three flats 100 miles from home because council can\u0027t find house big enoughSimone and Ansar Hussain, from Birmingham, were put up in hotels for two months before being moved into apartmentsShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAshley Preece21:02, 18 AUG 2018Updated09:54, 19 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA family-of-11 have been split up across three apartment blocks 100 miles from their home town because their local council can\u0027t find a house big enough for all of them. The Hussain family, from Birmingham, has been cooped up in hotels or flats as far away as Burton-upon-Trent and Bristol for 65 days. They are currently living in three flats in Bristol city centre as they wait for a home that can accommodate mum Simone, dad Ansar and their nine children aged between 17 months and 19 years. The family told Birmingham Live they were illegally evicted from their privately-rented flat and they are nearing their breaking point.  Simone, 39, said: “I’m crying almost all the time now. She added: “We’ve got our nine kids with us which is hard and my 17-month-old is struggling to sleep. The other children are aged four, six, eight, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 19. Simone said: I’ve got a 21-year-old daughter back home too in Coleshill who I haven’t seen since this all started in June and that upsets me.”  She said the family were forced out of their home in Great Barr due to severe leaking and electrical faults. Birmingham City Council said they accepted their application after the family were illegally evicted from their privately-rented flat. They confirmed the family are on the housing register at the highest priority banding, but there are very few six-bedroom properties available After moving out of their rented house on June 13, the Hussains were sent to a Travelodge in Burton as their three-bed property was deemed unsafe to live in.  Twenty-eight days followed as the parents continued with the school run in Great Barr, continually going back and forth in what would have been a gruelling 42-mile trip. The family’s month-long stay ended in Burton and they were sent packing 30 minutes away to another Travelodge - this time in Rugeley. Simone, who receives \u0026pound430-a-week in child tax credit, said: “Travelodges were horrible. You don’t have a kitchen so we couldn’t cook. “Eating out is extortionate. I kept having to borrow and borrow money - not only that but we were just stuck in a room all day and we still are.  “The kids are away from their friends all of the time. It’s just depressing and not fair on them.” After another 28-day stay at a Travelodge, the Hussains were moved on again and they were chauffeured 120 miles away to apartments in the middle of Bristol city centre, where they’re currently residing. Simone added: “The council paid for our taxis. They sent us three black cabs and the meter at the end was \u0026pound208 - that’s 600 quid in black cabs alone. “The apartments down here are better because I can cook now and get some shopping in and stuff but, as a family, we’re spread across three apartments. It’s far from ideal.  “I think it’s about \u0026pound150-a-night to stay here because my mum was going to come down. It’s scary. “I feel my kids are missing out on stuff, too. There’s not a lot to do - there’s no parks close by and we’re spending a fortune on petrol and parking. “We’re sweating now as well because the new school year is around the corner and I’ve got to get school uniforms. How am I meant to do that?” The Hussains were hopeful they’d return to Birmingham by August 28 but, according to the family, have now been told it is looking like September 25 instead.

These incredible snaps show the creature as he playfully swims after the underwater explorer, extending his flipper and rising out of the water to take a peek at her boat. In one shot she responds to his approach, reaching down to almost touch the majestic mammal’s “nose”. The magical moments were captured by Sydney photographer David Edgar on an expedition in Tonga, in the South Pacific. David said: “The photos came from a two to three-hour encounter with an extremely playful adolescent male.  “The whale came right up to the boat and would spyhop – which is swimming vertically and sticking his head out of the water to look at us. “A group of us got into the water and, within moments, the curious whale was circling around us and swimming right underneath us to get a good look. “He did this for about half an hour as our group bunched together tightly in the water, basically staying in the exact same spot.”  Revealing how the inquisitive creature seemed happy to interact, David added: “He’d gently place his pectoral fin out in front of us, and just leave it hanging there as he swam around us.” Humpback whales can grow as long as 60ft, and weigh up to 40 tonnes – but are remarkably agile. They have the longest flippers of any whale and use their massive tail fins to propel themselves through the water, and sometimes completely out of it.

The close and unrequited bond the pair once had now appears to be in tatters as Thomas Markle and Meghan\u0027s half-sister Samantha take it in turns to make public digs at Meghan, her husband Prince Harry and the Royal Family .  Meghan, however, has kept a dignified silence - and reportedly not spoken to her father since her wedding almost three months ago. But in a fresh outburst yesterday Mr Markle said of the Royal Family: “They are cult-like —– like Scientology — because they are secretive.  They close the door, pull the shades down and put their fingers in their ears so they don’t have to hear.  However before the now Duchess of Sussex, 37, met Harry she lovingly described Mr Markle as the most hardworking father you can imagine.  She laid bare her love for the man who always believed she would be a success and who made sacrifices so she could fulfill her dream of becoming an actress. She also told of the heartwarming Christmas gift her father gave her as a child, which she pictured him getting glares for from mums. And the only time she ever saw him so enraged it made his \u0027eyes pop\u0027. Meghan has also revealed the four words her father told her that will stay with her forever: “Draw your own box.” It was after Meghan came home one day from school upset.  Recalling the incident, she says she had to fill out a census form before an English exam and tick whether she was white, black, Hispanic or Asian. Being biracial - with a Caucasian father and a African American mother - she didn\u0027t know which box she fitted into, so out of confusion and sadness she left it blank. When she told her father what happened she admits she had never seen him angry before, but she could see the blotchiness of his skin crawling from pink to red. It made the green of his eyes pop and his brow was weighted at the thought of his daughter being prey to ignorance, she said. And in one of those parenting moments that no guidebook could ever prep you for, my dad said words that will stay with me forever: \u0027Draw your own box.\u0027    He wanted me to see beyond that census placed in front of me. He wanted me to find my own truth. Meghan has made no secret of struggling with her identity growing up, even saying her 20s were brutal.  She recalls being at home in LA on a college break when her mother, Doria Ragland , was called the ‘N’ word.  She said: We were leaving a concert and she wasn’t pulling out of a parking space quickly enough for another driver. My skin rushed with heat as I looked to my mom. Her eyes welling with hateful tears, I could only breathe out a whisper of words, so hushed they were barely audible: ‘It’s OK, Mommy.’ I was trying to temper the rage-filled air permeating our small silver Volvo. We drove home in deafening silence, her chocolate knuckles pale from gripping the wheel so tightly.  Meanwhile, so conscious his young daughter was wrestling with who she was as a person, Mr Markle one Christmas took apart two Barbie boxed sets, which came as a white Barbie family or a black one, to make a custom one for Meghan. When I was about seven, I had been fawning over a boxed set of Barbie dolls, she said. It was called The Heart Family and included a mom doll, a dad doll, and two children. This perfect nuclear family was only sold in sets of white dolls or black dolls. I don’t remember coveting one over the other, I just wanted one. On Christmas morning, swathed in glitter-flecked wrapping paper, there I found my Heart Family: a black mom doll, a white dad doll, and a child in each color. My dad had taken the sets apart and customized my family.

The retired Hollywood lighting director is also incensed by rumours that he is bitter that his daughter did not pay back thousands of dollars on her private education. Speaking from his home in Rosarito Beach, Mexico, the 74-year-old told the Mail On Sunday: I’ve given just three interviews but there are thousands of stories circulating out there and it’s not right that people should be allowed to make up lies and get away with it. I’ve read stories saying I’m a drug addict or alcoholic. I don’t understand where these stories come from. I’ve taken pills when I’ve been in pain but I’ve never abused drugs.  You couldn’t move in Hollywood in the 1980s [when he worked there] without seeing bowls of cocaine everywhere. But I don’t do drugs and I barely drink. As well as the rumours about addiction, Markle also denied stories that he did not attend Meghan’s 2011 wedding to Hollywood director Trevor Engelson, who she divorced just two years later. While photos from the ceremony in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, show the couple exchanging vows on the beach and Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, swimming in the sea, Mr Markle is not visible in any of the pictures. However he reasons that the lack of photos of him at the wedding was because he was well into his 60s and not much into frolicking.  He added that he was present at the ceremony and walked Meghan down the beach with Doria, with 100 other guests also attending. Markle said that while he does have photos of him and his daughter at her first wedding, he chooses not to share them as he feels that it would be in poor taste and would be offensive to Prince Harry. The entire resort had been booked out, and Markle said he contributed to the costs by selling Facebook shares at a low price in order to help out financially. He said: I don’t regret it in the slightest because I was happy to help out, but that stock would be worth a fortune now. I’m not broke, I’m not bitter and I never expected Meghan to pay me back for anything. I was happy as a father to give her a great education. I was happy to provide the best start in life to all my children. Of course I never expected her to pay me back for her schooling.  Meghan has not spoken to her father since Prince Harry phoned him in hospital following his heart attack days before the Royal Wedding on May 19. It has been reported that Harry scolded him during the phone call for working with the paparazzi over staged pictures including one where he was being measured for a wedding suit. During the call, Harry scolded him for co-operating with paparazzi over staged pictures, including one of him apparently being measured for a wedding suit. Mr Markle does still hope for a reconciliation with his daughter and if this were to happen, it could come in February. There are suggestions that ‘early talks’ have begun about Harry and Meghan possibly attending a charity polo match in Los Angeles or Santa Barbara, California as part of a US tour.

Former US diplomat Michael Markle insisted that despite his worsening health, he would have flown over from his home in Palm Bay, Florida. Meghan’s dad Thomas, 74, had to pull out of the wedding at short notice following a heart attack. Older brother Michael suffers from Parkinson’s disease but told the Sunday Mirror that wouldn’t have stopped him doing the honours as his niece married Prince Harry at Windsor Castle in May. Michael told how he had always supported Meghan and “done more for her” over the years than anyone else.  He admitted that Parkinson’s “is getting me now”. But asked if he had the strength to be by Meghan’s side, he proudly added: “Sure, I could have, if it was co-ordinated. Yes, I would have done it.” Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland was the only member of the bride’s family to attend the wedding. And Michael, 78, said he was surprised he didn’t make the guest list for the ceremony at St George’s Chapel. Speaking from his modest trailer park home, Michael wondered whether former actress Meghan, 37, may have been instructed not to make any exceptions in terms of which family members should get an invitation. He said: “I thought I would. But anyhow, I didn’t hear from her. “And I don’t know how much the Royal Family had influence on her or not. They didn’t accept anyone else so they couldn’t make an exception for me.” Michael was speaking after a barrage of insults and interviews directed at the royals by other members of his family.  Meghan’s dad has revealed intimate details of conversations with Prince Harry, 33, and even confessed how he lied to the Duke of Sussex about faking pictures with a British paparazzi. The photographs showed Thomas looking at Meghan and Harry’s engagement pictures on an internet cafe computer – and him apparently being measured for a wedding suit at a tailors. It turned out they were all staged. Now Thomas feels he has been dumped by his daughter. For years he worked long hours as a Hollywood lighting technician to help Meghan through private school and realise her dream of becoming an actress. With Meghan’s half-sister Samantha boasting of an upcoming salacious biography titled In The Shadows Of The Duchess, Michael insists he is the only member of the Markle family who has shown any loyalty.  He revealed how his connections helped secure Meghan a prestigious internship at the American embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, when she was 20. Michael said: “I’ve done more for her than the others. I’ve probably done more for her than most. I personally talked to the ambassador in Argentina for her.” Controversy over the wedding arrangements has haunted Harry and Meghan since the date was first set. The former Suits star told her father there was “no room” for him to make a speech – even when he said he wished to pay tribute to the couple at the reception. Other Markle relatives weighed in with their tuppence worth, causing huge embarrassment before and after the big day. And amid the fake pics furore, Thomas pulled out of the ceremony suffering heart problems with just days to go.  The whole, sorry saga has left Meghan even more reliant on mum Doria, 61, who has been her rock throughout. Michael has previously told how he thought his niece’s attitude towards her family was “uncalled for”. He said before the wedding: “I don’t understand why she has been so \u0026shyindifferent towards me. It’s uncalled for. I helped her out and I didn’t ask for anything in return.” Despite the disappointment at missing out on the big day, a neighbour at the trailer park retirement village told how Michael was delighed about the wedding. After moving in to his \u0026pound78,000 home he told everyone about his niece.  The source said: “He’s very proud of Meghan. When he moved in he asked everyone if they knew who she was and that she was marrying Prince Harry.” Meghan is expected to move her mum from the US to London as she embarks on the next stage of her marriage. She is said to want children as soon as possible after she and Harry return from their first major tour in October. The couple will spend a fortnight in Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand. In Sydney they will launch the fourth Invictus Games, the hugely successful sporting event which former soldier Harry founded for injured servicemen and women.  A royal insider said: “The trip is likely to be a welcome distraction for everyone, but especially for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. “Royal aides have been increasingly under pressure to find a way out of this crisis as the Markle family show no signs of keeping quiet. “So far Meghan and Harry have decided to stay quiet but something will have to give sooner rather than later.” Earlier this month it was revealed how royal advisers have held a series of crisis summits on how to stop Thomas Markle from heaping further distress on his daughter.  At least three meetings have taken place between Meghan and Harry’s senior team and other royal advisers to find a solution. Three options have been laid out to Meghan to try to resolve the public breakdown in relations with her dad. Our source said: “It’s an increasingly desperate situation and now it’s come down to three options being on the table. “Firstly, Meghan could contact her father straight away and appeal to him directly to stop hurting her.

Kate Jones, 35, went into hospital thinking she would be home to give her children their tea. But crucial errors by doctors triggered two cardiac arrests and she died as her husband Stewart sat in the waiting-room expecting to take her home. He only found out something had gone disastrously wrong when a panicked nurse rushed in asking him for the names of their children - in a bid to get his wife to focus and cling on to life. Shortly afterwards a doctor informed him the simple outpatient procedure had gone so disastrously wrong his wife had tragically died. Mr Jones, 48, said: It was the most horrendous thing. I took my wife to hospital for this test which we thought was perfectly safe and I went home a widower.  The hospital still haven\u0027t apologised or even held their hands up and admitted liability and that has been especially hard. It has made everything so much worse. Now he has been awarded \u0026pound700,000 in an out-of-court settlement after a five year legal battle that has left him furious and demoralised with the NHS. Like thousands of others Kate, a highly-regarded beautician who worked for Virgin Atlantic, needed an angiogram to check for narrowing of the arteries. Though she was slim and healthy, she took statins to control high cholesterol levels - a condition which ran in her family. But after suffering a slight heart palpitations she was referred for an angiogram at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex. She and her husband were told it was a routine test carried out as an out-patient. On the NHS Choices website it is described as a generally safe and painless procedure. Mrs Jones went for the angiography on October 30 2013, thinking she would be in hospital for a couple of hours and home later the same day. The nightmare that followed is indelibly etched on her husband\u0027s mind. He said: She went in feeling a bit nervous but safe in the knowledge it was straightforward day-care procedure. Despite her very occasional heart murmur and high cholesterol, Kate was otherwise fit and full of life, always on the go and running around after the kids.  He drove her to the hospital and sat in the waiting room and the procedure began at about 11am. Mr Jones, is a manager at an electrical wholesalers who lives with their children Siena, 10, Lily, eight, Jaxon, six, in Stanstead Abbotts, Herts. He said: After an hour I saw staff come hurrying from the room looking panicked. It looked like they were running for help and then a specialist went into the room. I knew something had gone wrong but didn\u0027t know how dreadful it was until a nurse came out and asked me then names of our children. They wanted this to keep Kate focussed on her children and help her cling to life. I was in total shock. What had tragically occurred was a catalogue of blunders that began when the doctor tore an artery causing her to go into cardiac arrest. The torn artery was serious but not in itself fatal. However, despite the tear being seen, there was a delay of 15 crucial minutes before a heart specialist was called, causing the injury to worsen and Mrs Jones\u0027 condition to deteriorate. When the consultant arrived he inserted a guide wire to insert a stent which would have increased blood flow through the artery into the heart. But tragically the connector keeping the guide wire in place broke and, instead of leaving the wire in place and replacing the connector, the surgeon instead pulled the guide wire out meaning the stent could not be deployed. As a result Mrs Jones no blood was getting to the heart, she went into a second cardiac arrest and died at 1.30pm. Devastated and in shock, Mr Jones returned home to break the news to their children Siena, Lily, Jaxon, and Jake - her son from a previous relationship. He said: Kate was the love of my life. She was vibrant, caring and talented, with a unique sense of humour. She was so proud of her kids and she made a lasting impression on everyone who met her. I still find it hard to believe she\u0027s not here. Mr Jones is now the sole breadwinner and pays a nanny \u0026pound25,000 a year to look after his children while he is at work. The out-of-court settlement will help provide future financial security for them but came after a five year legal battle with the hospital. No amount of compensation can bring her back and we have to live the rest of our lives without her love, support and zest for life. I brought the action because I desperately want lessons to be learnt from Kate\u0027s death and do not want any other family to go through what we have to endure since her untimely death.

Britain’s worst female serial \u0026shymurderer – who helped her husband Fred rape their daughter, kill her and bury her under their patio – now goes to weekly chapel services. And the deluded monster, who blames her depraved hubby for \u0026shy“making me do things”, insists she will be at peace in an after-life. The astonishing revelations come from Catherine Jones, 52, who spent time in jail with Rose, 64. And they follow claims this week that more victims of Fred West are buried in Glasgow, where he lived before meeting Rose.  Catherine, 52, who was in HMP Low Newton, Co Durham, with Rose, told the Sunday People : “She really believes she’ll be forgiven when she dies.  “Will she? She put her own daughter under the patio.”  Rose’s religious confession came after she was asked: “What’s it like knowing you’ll be leaving this place in a wooden box?” Catherine said: “She came to me and my mates and said, ‘I’ve found a new life in God.’” Rose, who was convicted of ten murders including her daughter Heather, has embraced religion so firmly she visits the prison chapel every Sunday. But last night a close family member told the Sunday People: “We’re trying to move on and if Rose thinks that asking God to forgive her will in some way make up for what she’s done then that’s not a god that I would understand.  “There is nothing she can do that would put right what happened. “Really I think that it’s disrespectful to the families because they’re \u0026shynever going to get closure.” Fred and Rose killed, dismembered and buried young women and children at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester. Fred, 53, hanged himself in jail on New Year’s Day 1995 while awaiting trial for 12 murders between 1967 and 1987. Rose is serving a whole life tariff after being convicted in 1995. Ex-inmate Catherine, freed in June after serving 19 years for killing a man in Liverpool, said: “Rose blamed Fred for \u0026shyeverything. She said he bullied her and made her do things.”  Catherine gave a graphic description of Rose’s \u0026shybehaviour in Low Newton. She said: “Rose was the main woman in there but she did get stick because of who she is. “She was treated \u0026shydifferently. I’d say it was preferential treatment. The more \u0026shynotorious prisoners got that. Rose was clever, manipulative, clued up. That’s how she got favourable treatment. “She’d bake cakes for the girls. She was allowed to shower on her own, she didn’t have to go with everyone else. “We had ‘social’ every day where we would sit round smoking and chatting. Rose walked past and we shouted ‘Rose, give us a minute.’  “It was when she came over that someone said, ‘What’s it like knowing you’ll leave here in a wooden box?’ “That’s when she came out with all this stuff about ‘finding God’ and being ‘forgiven by God’ and ‘Fred made me do it.’ We couldn’t believe it. “She was blaming him but we all knew what she’d done. Rose does go to chapel every Sunday. She may be trying to find something by doing that but I don’t know what – after \u0026shyeverything she’s done.” Catherine said Rose was allowed her own area where she could do sewing. “It was her sewing room and she made a little tapestry for the door \u0026shysaying Threads Room. “But when she was away we messed about with it and changed it to Fred’s Room. “When she came back she just shook her head and took it down.  “Another time she was playing music in the cell. She was playing When Will I See You Again by The Three Degrees. “At the end of each chorus we were all shouting ‘Fred!’.” Catherine added: “She did get stick, but she was the main woman, she ruled the roost. I wasn’t intimidated by her like others. She knew I spoke my mind.” Catherine also spoke about Rose’s lesbian affairs. “She had a few girlfriends in there, different relationships. “She’d make cakes for the girls. She loved the kitchen, she used to eat a lot. She grassed me up once. I was banned from the kitchen but I snuck in to get some food and she grassed on me for it.” Catherine told how Rose tried to get all the TV sets removed when a \u0026shydocumentary about her horrific crimes was due to be screened. “She tried to get all the tellies turned off. It was because there was a \u0026shyprogramme on about her and Fred. “They wouldn’t do it and the next day she wouldn’t come out of her cell. “She didn’t want to talk to anyone because she knew we’d all been watching.” Catherine also told how Rose had “dead eyes”.  She said: “She walked round \u0026shylooking at the floor, not making eye contact. She had dark eyes. Most people have a little sparkle in their eyes, but hers were cold, dead.” Catherine, who was convicted with another person of robbing and killing a man in a B\u0026ampB, added: “I really regret what I was involved in. My family was gutted. “But Rose is totally \u0026shydeluded trying to blame Fred for everything.” This week calls were made to reinvestigate Fred’s life in Glasgow in the 1960s. Fred was working as a Mr Whippy ice-cream man when he ran over and killed a three-year-old boy in 1965. Paul Pender, a screenwriter who has researched Fred’s crimes, claims there is evidence that he deliberately hit the child. The author has been discussing the case with a man who worked in a Glasgow abattoir with Fred’s first wife Rena – \u0026shymurdered by Fred in 1971. Pender believes Fred used his shed at the allotment to have sex with girls after luring them into his ice-cream van. He also believes Fred learned butchery skill to dismember his victims’ bodies after visiting the abattoir where Rena worked. After leaving Scotland Fred returned to Gloucester, where he went on a murdering spree with Rose, whom he married in 1972.  Last night the Ministry of Justice \u0026shydeclined to comment.  Terror at 25 Cromwell St  Rose West murdered at least ten girls with her husband Fred, dismembering their bodies and burying them under their house of horrors at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester. Rose met Fred, who was 13 years older, at Cheltenham bus station when she was 15. Rose’s first murder, in June 1971, was Fred’s step-daughter from his first marriage, Charmaine, aged eight. At the time Fred was in prison for theft. A friend revealed when they visited the house Charmaine was standing on a chair with her hands tied behind her back with a belt. Rose was holding a large wooden spoon and about to hit her. She later said Charmaine had been naughty and had to be punished. After killing her, Rose told people she had “gone to live with her mother and bloody good riddance”. Another victim was daughter Heather, 16. The couple would tell their other children if they didn’t behave they would “end up under the patio like Heather”. Their sickening crimes began to unravel in 1992 when Fred was accused of raping his 13-year-old daughter. Shocked cops soon discovered the couple had been abducting girls from bus stops around Gloucester and holding them captive before killing them. Police discovered mutilated bodies buried in the garden and cellar of their home, which has since been demolished. Victims  1967: Ann McFall, Scottish nanny and Fred’s lover, eight months pregnant.    1970: Rena Costello, Fred’s first wife.   1972: Charmaine West, eight.    1973: Linda Gough, 21, seamstress from Gloucester.    1973: Lucy Partington, 21, university student.   1974: Carol Cooper, 15, from Worcester.    1975: Juanita Mott, 19, of Newent, Glos.    1975: Shirley Hubbard, 15, from Worcester.    1977: Therese Siegenthaler, 21, Swiss hitchhiker.    1977: Alison Chambers, 17, from Swansea.    1978: Shirley Robinson, 18, Fred’s pregnant lover.   1987: Heather West, 16, eldest daughter.

The revelation drew sharp criticism, but apparent friction between two members of the bride-to-be\u0027s family might also be of concern.  The 28-year-old royal has chosen to marry her fianc\u0026eacute Jack Brooksbank at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle where Prince Harry wed Meghan Markle in May.    previously reported that the copycat Royal Wedding has caused outrage over its \u0026pound2million security bill .  And while Princess Eugenie\u0027s open top-carriage and celebrity guest list show similarities to Meghan and Harry\u0027s big day, there could also be family friction at the wedding in October. While not at the same level of the Markle family feud, which has seen Meghan\u0027s half-sister Samantha brand the former Suits actress as Princess Pushy and inhumane, two of Eugine\u0027s wedding guests apparently don\u0027t see eye to eye.   According to the Mail on Sunday , Prince Phillip, 97, will be keen to avoid the Duchess of York, 58, if a recent awkward encounter is anything to go by.  Fergie visited the Queen at Balmoral last week with former spouse Prince Andrew and their eldest daughter Beatrice on Thursday. However, according to the article, following what seems to have been careful planning, Fergie left the Scottish retreat at 10.30am on Sunday. After saying her goodbyes to Andrew and Beatrice who were attending church, she headed for Aberdeen airport in a Range Rover. It is said that it was then that the Duke of Edinburgh arrived at the estate at 11.15am, to be reunited with the Queen.  A Balmoral source told the paper: Her Majesty often has the Duchess for a few days at Balmoral early in her annual summer holiday there, but Prince Philip does not like being in the same building as her. He just can’t bring himself to forgive her for some of the outrageous things she has done. It is believed that her former father-in-law still has not forgiven her for the ‘toegate’ scandal of 1992. While she still married to Prince Andrew, Fergie was photographed on a sun lounger having her toes sucked by ‘financial adviser’ John Bryan.

Julian Dunkerton, co-founder of Superdry, said he\u0027s making the enormous donation to the People\u0027s Vote campaign because he sees a genuine chance to turn this around.  Writing in the Sunday Times , he said: I\u0027m putting some of my money behind the People’s Vote campaign because I know we have a genuine chance to turn this around.

The money will be spent on a detailed polling exercise, which he hopes will give Remainers confidence when asking for another public vote. Dunkerton claims that if Brexit happened 20 years ago, his brand would never have been a success. Unsurprisingly, the move has public opinion divided on social media. Some Leave voters have criticised the donation as an example of the rich using wealth to influence democracy and want to boycott the brand, while some Remainers back his support for the People\u0027s Vote - and believe the public having a say on the deal in such an uncertain political climate.

Kate, 19, was overwhelmed with shock when she was picked out from 40 other candidates to be crowned Teen Ultimate Beauty Of The World. The pageant is held to celebrate \u0026shydiversity and people who are “beautiful inside and out” – and supports the Make-A-Wish Foundation, a charity which makes dreams come true for poorly children. Kate had dabbled with modelling before the two-day event and \u0026shyentered it only for experience. And she admitted it was a massive surprise when she heard her name read out as the winner. She said: “I was in shock. My family were all in the audience, \u0026shycrying and cheering. “My dream has come true. And that dream is to get a chance to inspire young people who have Down’s \u0026shysyndrome and other special needs to believe in themselves.”  Kate had been invited to enter as the representative for her native Northern Ireland by the pageant’s director, Taylor-Rae Hamilton. Taylor-Rae was one of hundreds of people touched by a message Kate’s mum Deirdre had posted on Facebook asking for support in her attempts to become a successful model. Kate travelled just 25 miles from her home in Cookstown, Co Tyrone, to the contest venue in Portadown, where other candidates had assembled after flying in from all around the world to represent their nations.  The pageant has three categories for kids, teens and over-20s and is open to anyone regardless of weight, height or marital status. The contest began with an interview by a panel of judges. Kate’s mum was not allowed in the room with her, but could hear her making the judges laugh. Deirdre said: “I knew she’d charm them but what made me most proud was how Kate looked after other candidates, \u0026shyencouraging and supporting them.” That evening, candidates of all ages mingled at a “get to you know you” party with a tropical beach theme. Day Two was catwalk day. The first round was casual, so Kate wore jeans and a white T-shirt. The second round was called Time to Shine, which Kate said “meant hair curled, make-up applied and a sparkling, turquoise sequined dress, channelling my inner Little Mermaid”.  For the formal round, Kate wore a black and white cocktail dress with a side split. She said: “I sashayed down the catwalk giving it all my sass. I just wanted to have fun and truly expected someone else’s name to be called as the winner. “Now I’ll be attending photoshoots throughout the year and will be a judge and mentor at next year’s final. “Most importantly I’ll be involved in an appeal where we’ll deliver hundreds of toys to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. I want to give poorly children a moment of sunshine.” Kate has previously walked the catwalk at Belfast Fashion Week and taken part in campaigns for boutiques in her home town.Today she will be wearing her sash and crown again at the start of the Red Dress Run in aid of the Chest, Heart and Stroke Foundation in Lurgan, Co Armagh.  But the road to success has not been easy. When she was born doctors told her parents Deirdre and John to \u0026shyprepare for the worst and hope for the best. Deirdre said: “After two sons, John and I were thrilled to be expecting a girl. “When Kate was born it was confirmed she had Down’s syndrome within hours. “The doctor painted a bleak future. He said she wouldn’t learn to read, her speech would be limited and she’d never hold full conversations. I thought of him as she made her acceptance speech up on the stage at the pageant, describing her hopes for an inclusive society, one where people like her are treated as equals.” Deirdre and John agreed to raise Kate no differently to their sons Patrick and Michael, then 11 and two. Two years later younger sister Ella joined the family. Deirdre said: “When she announced at 13 she wanted to be a model we didn’t discredit the idea just because she had Down’s syndrome.” Kate discovered a passion for make-up, clothes and fashion and never wavered in her ambition. But she \u0026shystruggled to get any gigs. Her mum emailed agencies with photos but was \u0026shytold there was no work.

To this day police still don\u0027t know whether the 9lb baby died of natural causes or if she was victim of something more sinister.  Investigators said back when the tiny body was found 16 years ago that whoever was responsible for abandoning it must have been a local as the spot along the River Teign could only have been found by someone who knew it was there, reports Plymouth Herald .  Named by police as Amanda, which means worthy of love, the newborn child with a mass of black hair was discovered by local fisherman Barry Kingwell at Arch Brook Creek on the Teign estuary near Coombe Cellars, South Devon, in September 2002.  He was checking his crab pots at around 8am, when he spotted a sack in the reeds. Inside the sack was a dark-haired, baby girl. The baby had been wrapped in a man-made white hessian sack, which had been placed into a similar larger bag. Both bags were weighed down with a house brick. A post-mortem examination revealed that the 9lb baby was born alive and healthy. Nobody knows if she was dead when she was left in the creek or if she was left there to die. Despite numerous police appeals, no parents or relatives were found.  But a DNA sample was taken from Amanda’s tiny body and through careful examination of the site where she was found and material discovered, police have been able to establish a full DNA profile of the mother. To identify the parents, police needed a friend, relative or anyone who has the remotest suspicion to get in touch. Nobody came forward. To this day the case remains a mystery. A year after the shocking discovery, the people of Teignmouth and police who worked on the investigation remained incredibly moved by the sad discovery. As a mark of respect they installed a marble plaque in tribute to the mystery infant, who medical experts say died within days of her birth. Standing beside the plaque inscribed with the words: “A tiny flower lent not given, to bud on earth and bloom in heaven”, Detective Sergeant Ken Lamont, who led the investigation, said he hoped the tribute to the baby might prompt someone to break their silence.  Sadly, it didn\u0027t. To this day nobody knows if the baby died by natural causes or was left to die. Speaking 15 years ago DS Lamnont said: “While the case remains in the public domain there is always a chance of the mother or someone with knowledge of the matter to come forward. “But at such a time we thought that a headstone or plaque would be a fitting end to this tragic incident. “It is unusual to have a common grave marked, although Teignbridge District Council felt the tragedy had affected the hearts and minds of the local community and were happy to allow the erection of the memorial.” He added: “We still do not know yet whether this baby died out of natural causes or whether it was something more sinister, but so far all of our leads to find the mother, father or a relative, have turned out negative. Police were convinced that the mother and father lived locally.  They said that the spot on the River Teign where the body was found would be difficult to find unless you knew it was there and said that the bags could only be bought by local people. “Concealed births are very common but this is very rare as where the baby was deposited is not easy to get to and the mother would not have been able to get there on her own,” said DS Lamont. “It is likely that a third party was involved. But we need to find out what happened. “It could be that the mother was very vulnerable and unaware of what was happening in the birth process itself and unknown to her, or it could be that she is a juvenile who did not know which way to turn.

Ex tropical storm to batter parts of UK with wind and rain this weekend      Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said: “Ernesto will make landfall into Sunday, with up to 50-60mm of rain in six to nine hours in the North-West and wind gusts there of 40mph gale-force or a bit higher, and 35mph inland even in southern England. “Ernesto’s warm and humid air stays here for the first half of the week, with 26-28C from Monday to Wednesday in the South, with mainly dry weather for most. “A cold front brings rain on Thursday, but the Bank Holiday weekend looks relatively warm at 23C and a degree or two warmer not ruled out. “The South will be mainly dry, and the North still seeing good sunny spells, but less settled.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice sunday mirror no time","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Sunday Mirror: No time to waste for total recall of faulty dishwashersIf there were proper channels in place to identify and track faulty dishwashers, Elizabeth Griffin\u0027s life might have been sparedShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByVoice of the Mirror22:36, 18 AUG 2018Updated23:03, 18 AUG 2018NewsopinionThe senseless death of a disabled grandma could have been avoided with an effective system to recall faulty kitchen appliancesGet daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMachines can go wrong. That’s a fact of life. But, as experts say, there’s a big difference between them being faulty and them being dangerous. Elizabeth Griffin’s dishwasher was so dangerous it killed her. The 71-year-old grandmother had a model that should have been recalled. It wasn’t. And it caused a fire that ultimately led to Mrs Griffin’s death. Her family solicitor said her relatives had lost a wonderful wife, mother and grandmother. The great tragedy of Mrs Griffin’s sad is that it was avoidable. If there were proper channels in place to identify and track these faulty dishwashers, they could have all been recalled. Since April 2012 almost 16,000 blazes have been caused by faulty kitchen appliances.  Washing machines, tumble dryiers, cookers, dishwashers, fridges are all high-risk. It’s our responsibility to keep an eye on them and use them responsibly. And it’s the responsibility of the firms that manufacture them to respond quickly if there are any faults. But serious faults can cost businesses millions. Before recalling and replacing items they want to explore every possible avenue. That means delays. In the case of Hotpoint, it took them three years to organise a recall of their faulty dishwashers. Three years. That’s far too long. Earlier this year, a committee of powerful MPs said the government were ‘painfully slow’ in bringing in a white goods product recall system. The Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee said ministers were not showing the ‘necessary degree of urgency’ needed to tackle the problem.  Whirlpool is a case in point. They have a massive amount of work to do to recall a faulty batch of tumble driers. The company points to a lack of capacity, environmental concerns and a whole host of other logistical problems. But there is only really one fact that matters. There are a million defective machines in people’s homes. That’s untold lives at risk. If Whirlpool refuses to speed things up the government must step in. And that goes for any other company dragging its feet - or putting cash before people’s lives.

Today that will change when the 46-year-old father-of-three steps out to referee a football match as Lucy, the first transgender referee. It is a historic moment for the sport. Lucy is naturally fearful of how some in the macho world of football might react. Bigots thinking of hurling abuse should read why Lucy decided to speak out.

Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba should never have been struck off – but who can blame the parents for wanting to prevent a similar tragedy ever happening to anyone else? As a mum myself, I have the greatest, heart-rending sympathy for the parents of six-year-old Jack Adcock, who died just 12 hours after being admitted to hospital with vomiting and diarrhoea. His life could easily have been saved, had the seriousness of his condition been spotted in time. Quite understandably, Victor and Nicky Adcock feel anger as well as grief. So when Dr Bawa-Garba was convicted of manslaughter and struck off the medical register, they vowed to celebrate with champagne at Jack’s grave.  This week, however, eight years after their little boy’s death, they were dealt an unexpected blow – and one which has left them reeling. Because last Tuesday the General Medical Council overturned its previous decision and reinstated Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba to the register so she can return to work. Indeed, they now say she should never have been struck off, and that she was “a competent and useful doctor, who can provide considerable useful future service to society.” Like the Adcocks, I was at first stunned. As Jack’s mum said this week: “How can somebody make that many mistakes, be found guilty by a jury and be able to practise again? If you walked into a hospital and saw that doctor, would you be happy for her to treat your child?” Not me, I thought. But dig a bit deeper, and it is so much more complicated than that. Terrible tragedy though it was, was it also a case of an overworked and under-supported doctor being “thrown under the bus” as the huge social media storm has suggested?

The mum-to-be, 34, was expecting a baby boy, who she planned to name Nico, her heartbroken brother has revealed. Frankie Rzucek also told how Shanann struggled to conceive her three children as she suffered from lupus, a disease that makes all pregnancies risky. Christopher Watts is currently in custody accused of murdering his wife and daughters Bella, four, and three-year-old Celeste. The 33-year-old suspect allegedly stuffed his children\u0027s bodies into oil and gas tanks to stop them smelling.  Shanann\u0027s younger brother Frankie Rzucek paid tribute to his sister on Facebook. He wrote: She is the hardest working person I\u0027ve ever known. No matter if her lupus was acting up or if she was pregnant, nothing stoped (sic) her from doing what needed to be done. She was very successful and driven. Shanann was 15 weeks pregnant and was due to have a gender reveal party on Saturday, a friend said.  Earlier this week, Watts sobbed on TV as he appealed for the return of the trio before allegedly confessing he had killed them. The bodies were found on the property of Anadarko Petroleum, one of Colorado\u0027s largest oil and gas drillers.  Police yesterday claimed Watts hid his daughters in the tanks to conceal the smell, according to Denver7. A body believed to be that of 34-year-old Shanann was found nearby at an oil rig. The site is close to the family home in Frederick, on the northern outskirts of Denver. In a statement to CBS4, her family said: “It is with deep hurt, confusion and anger to confirm our beautiful cousin Shanann Watts, her unborn child, and her two angelic daughters, Bella (4), Celeste (3) were viciously murdered by husband Chris Watts who confessed to the killings. Please keep Shanann’s parents and brother in your prayers.”  Watts appeared shackled in court wearing an orange jumpsuit. Charges will be filed on Monday. He could face three counts of murder and three charges of tampering with evidence. Prosecutors said they believe the family were murdered in the family home and the bodies were later moved. Police are remaining tight lipped about the cause of death and whether the children were still alive when Shanann was killed. It also emerged today how Shanann had express concerns to her friends that her husband was being unfaithful to her.  It came to her mind that possibly he could be cheating, Amanda Thayer told CBS News. Shanann was reported missing on Monday after returning home from a business trip at around 1am. Watts has spent the weekend at home with their children. Chris said he last saw his wife at 5.15am before he left for work.  Speaking on NBC\u0027s Today show , Watts said he and Shanann had had an emotional conversation that morning and had stayed up talking but didn\u0027t give any further details. He said: I don\u0027t feel like this is even real right now. It\u0027s like a nightmare I can\u0027t wake up from. He said Shanann was planning to go to a friend\u0027s house with their daughters and Fox 31 reports that was the last time he heard from her.  Watts said he saw his two girls asleep on the baby monitor as he left the house. He said he text her numerous times but didn\u0027t receive any response which he thought was odd. At around midday, he checked their doorbell camera and saw that a friend had stopped by but no one opened the door. Watts said he rushed home but no one was there, even though Shanann\u0027s car was in the driveway. He then spoke to police and reported them as missing at 1.40pm. Watts said: When I got home yesterday, it was like a ghost town. I was trying to get home as fast as I can, I was blowing through stop lights, I was blowing through everything just trying to get home as fast as I can because none of this made sense.

I complicate my game sometimes but I’m working on just playing it simple and that’s what the gaffer and (assistant manager) Laurie Ellis want me to do.“They stress to me I have to play it simple at times and then do the magic when I can.”Not that it’s an easy process and Glass admits when he’s on the pitch he wants to be involved at the sharp end, doing the things that help win games.“I like to create chances and I really love to get shots in on the goal, it’s what my game is about.“I’m an attacking player and I like to excite but you can’t always do that and sometimes it is about keeping things simple and doing it for the team.”As those words show, this is a young man who does not lack confidence in his own ability but he’s also one who gives an honest assessment of his performances.For instance, while he was delighted to have played his part in a young United line-up that battled back from two goals down to beat St Johnstone’s U/21s in the Betfred Cup on Wednesday night, he was far from completely satisfied with his work.“It was a brilliant result, all the boys worked really hard to come from two behind like we did.“Obviously, the experienced players helped us a lot but I thought the young boys, including myself, dug in and we battled and battled.“St Johnstone were no mugs and I thought they really impressed so it was good to get on top of them by the end.“I know I wasn’t at my best but, like all the boys, I dug in and helped get the result.“I was maybe trying too hard at times for the killer pass or maybe trying to shoot too early.“Sometimes things don’t come off on the park but I still worked hard and helped the team and that’s what you have to make sure you do.”As he keeps grafting towards making the breakthrough in the first team on a regular basis, Glass was delighted by the victory, not least because it means there will be further opportunities to show he is ready.“This cup is a chance to get 90 minutes and, if I’m not playing in the league, I need to get games somewhere.“If it’s in the Irn-Bru Cup it’s better for me and the other boys, because they are very competitive, like league games.“You want to win them, both teams do, and it gives you the chance to show up well.“We want to do well in it and I think we can.“I thought our fitness was a big factor against St Johnstone.“We had a hard pre-season and I think we got the benefits of that against St Johnstone because we finished the game strongly and looked the fitter team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/SNS-15266913-Dundee-United-v-Dunfermline.jpg-e1534240458997-820x564.jpg ","title":"el bakhtaoui speaks of frustration at not playing in right position at dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee’s Faissal El Bakhtaoui is convinced he can still make it in the Premiership but is happy to have the chance to prove himself all over again at Dunfermline.The Frenchman left Tayside for the Pars on a season-long loan after becoming increasingly frustrated with his lack of game-time at Dens Park.The 25-year-old scored eight times in 66 appearances for the Dark Blues after joining from Dunfermline in 2016 but failed to scale the heights he did with the Pars first time round.The striker insists his opportunities in the central striking role were all too rare under Neil McCann and this term was unlikely to be any better.Now the former futsal star, who joined Dunfermline as a complete unknown in 2012, is desperate to breathe new life into his career in familiar surroundings.Speaking ahead of last night\u0026#8217s Irn-Bru Cup clash away to Inverness Caley Thistle, he said: “I have come back a better player, with more experience. I learned so much in the Premiership, even though I was a bit frustrated at Dundee.“I think I can play at that level but it just didn’t happen for me.

dundee midfielder spence","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStraight-Talking Lewis Spence insists it’s only a matter of time before Dundee’s form in front of goal turns around, saying “some team is going to take a battering” from them soon.The 22-year-old is hoping that’s today as Ayr United come calling in the Betfred Cup last 16 at Dens Park.Although he’s backing his team-mates to start putting away the chances they are creating, he knows just how tough the Honest Men will be to get past.Dundee will have to keep an eye on dangerman striker Lawrence Shankland.He said: “It’s going to come, our luck has to change some time because we are getting the chances.“I think some team is going to take a battering soon, we’ll take three or four off somebody, and hopefully that might be this weekend.“It’ll be a really tough game, though, Ayr are no pushovers, I know a few of their players and they are a decent team.“They play some good stuff and have goalscorers in their team so it’ll be tough.“They won League One so they’ve come up with confidence and have goals in their team, boys that can put it in the net.“They’ll come here with confidence but we’re confident we can get the job done if we apply ourselves the right way professionally.“I’ve always said we want a cup run here to give the fans something back and this is a great draw for us.“It’ll be difficult but we win that and we’re in the quarters and a decent draw can see you to the semis at Hampden.“However, we need to take care of Ayr first – we can’t look past them.”Spence was an injury doubt for this one after he was subbed in last weekend’s 1-0 defeat at home to Aberdeen with an ankle knock. He says, though, coming off was just a precaution after needing surgery on the same ankle last season.He said: “It was nothing too serious. I had a shot and rolled my ankle a bit and I’ve had previous with it, so it was a bit of a worry at the time. However, a good bit of rest and the physio saw it. I’ve trained this week and it’s good. I just need to keep an eye on it.”Now would be an unfortunate time for Spence to be ruled out of action after some impressive displays in the early-season games and particularly due to the level of competition in the position now at Dens Park.“Last year there were a lot of centre-mids but again this year we’re very strong there, one of the strongest areas in the team,” he added.“I think that’s good because it keeps everyone on their toes, you can’t slack because there will be somebody else to take your place.“I believe in my ability and I’ve worked hard over the summer, worked hard in pre-season, too.“Obviously, I’ve been in the position but Glen Kamara is to come back and you’ve got Adil Nabi, Paul McGowan, Elton Ngwatala and Kharl Madianga, so there’s a lot of competition in there. I think throughout the season it will be getting rotated round and, hopefully, I can be in that team.“I think I’ve done OK so far. It’s still early but I want to keep this up through the whole season.“Last year I played well in stages and then got injured so I want to play consistently every week, play as much as I can, and obviously help the team climb the table.”And the way to do that will be to start finding the net, something Spence is adamant that’ll change soon.“I think our luck will turn around.“We have to put some of these chances away, we all know that, but the main thing is we are creating chances.“One day it is going to click, something is just missing at the moment but we all believe in the guys up front to go and do it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b769ff279716.jpg ","title":"too many people have jumped witnesses recall horror as man stands close to edge of tay road bridge","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWitnesses have spoken about the horror of seeing the police incident that closed Tay Road Bridge yesterday.The bridge was shut in both directions yesterday amid fears for the safety of a man seen standing close to the edge.Police, the fire service, the coastguard and Broughty Ferry lifeboat were all on the scene, with the bridge closing at around 4am.The man was about a third of the way along the bridge, from the Fife side.Traffic was being diverted via Perth and the A90, with queues beginning to build up around 8.30am.However, some motorists had stopped and parked near the bridge entrance on the Dundee side as the drama unfolded.Ross Mackenzie, an apprentice bricklayer with building firm Panbride Contracts in Carnoustie, was on his way to St Andrews for work around 7.30am when police stopped his van to tell him the bridge was closed.The 25-year-old said he hoped the man could be brought to safety.He said: “We got here and were told we couldn’t get over the bridge. We thought about driving the Perth way to Fife but decided just to see how it goes and hopefully the bridge reopens soon.“We were told it’s someone at the side of the bridge and there’s concern for their safety.“Whoever it is, I hope they can be talked down.“Too many people have jumped from it.”A dog walker, who asked not to be named, said she thought there had been a road traffic collision initially.“The road closes for crashes all the time so that’s your first thought,” she said.“Then I noticed the lifeboat and realised there must be either someone in the water or fears they were going to jump.“It’s just terrible someone would want to do that.

Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the under-performance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs.\"The CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.\"Retail workers trade union Usdaw says it is seeking \"urgent clarification\" from Homebase owner Hilco over its long-term plans for the firm.National officer Dave Gill said: \"All too often staff are excluded from the CVA process as the future of their jobs is being decided.\"Clearly there is a huge task ahead.

His only previous start was in the 1-0 win at Dundee last December, the game after he scored a superb free-kick in a 2-1 loss to Rangers.The Dons made their intentions clear straight from the kick-off when Gary Mackay-Steven found Stevie May with a cross from the right flank.Striker May fired off a 10 yard shot that keeper Craig Samson pushed wide for a corner.There were just nine seconds on the clock.Moments later midfielder Stephen Gleeson fired a 22 yard free kick over the bar.In the fifth minute the highly dangerous Mackay-Steven picked out Lewis Ferguson at the back post but his diving header was saved for a corner.Straight after Dominic Ball met a Frank Ross corner with a glancing header that Ferguson got a toe onto only to see the effort flash inches wide.Again in the 10th minute Mackay-Steven was provider when his drifted corner from the right found Mikey Devlin who headed across goal from 18 yards and wide.Aberdeen could, and should, have been two or three up inside the first 10 minutes.St Mirren finally mustered an effort in the 13th minute when Nicolai Brock-Madsen headed wide.Aberdeen\u0026#8217s deserved opener came in the 15th minute when a pass from Ferguson found MACKAY-STEVEN who took it on the volley.The winger smashed the ball into the ground from just inside the box and it bounced over keeper Samson.The Dons were tearing St Mirren apart.It was 2-0 in the 19th minute when the sensational Mackay-Steven raced past Hayden Coulson and captain Graeme SHINNIE powered in on the blindside at the back post to head in.St Mirren looked shell-shocked and were hugely fortunate to just be two goals down after only 20 minutes.The rout continued when it became 3-0 in the 26th minute when Wright pounced on a poor clearance from keeper SamsonHe rounded the keeper and then unselfishly squared a pass along the face of goal to Stevie MAY who clinically fired in from 12 yards.It was May\u0026#8217s first competitive goal for the Dons since a 4-1 win over St Johnstone on March 31.In the 36th minute Ball picked out Shinnie at the edge of the box and his dipping header went just over.Yet again Mackay-Steven was in the heart of the action when he skipped past Coulson then unleashed a low drive from 12 yards that keeper Samson did well to block at the near post.On the stroke of half-time Shinnie had a 12 yard drive blocked by Samson.It was the final action of a superb 45 minute shift from the Dons who received a deserved standing ovation from the Red Army at half-time.It was 4-0 in the 56th minute when Aberdeen were awarded a penalty when Mackay-Steven was taken down by Coulson as he attempted to step past him.The left-back had no answer for MACKAY-STEVEN who then stepped up to take the penalty \u0026#8211 and converted.In the 81st minute Shinnie curled a 22 yard shot inches wide of the far corner with keeper Samson beaten.Moments later teenage substitute Bruce Anderson volleyed from distance forcing keeper Samson to push wide.ABERDEEN: Lewis, Ball, Devlin, Considine, Shinnie, Gleeson, Ferguson, McGinn, Mackay-Steven, Wright, May.Subs: Forrester (for  Ross 60), Anderson (for Wright 70), McLennan (for May 80)Subs not used: Cerny,  Cosgrove, Campbell,  Roscoe.ST MIRREN: Samson, P.

Stubbs was later sacked after five months in the job.Ball said: “Alan Stubbs helped get the best out of me. He had me playing midfield and at centre-half and gave me those options.“It was good for me as were his man-management and the way he develops players.“Having played for him at Rotherham, I know that St Mirren will be very organised.“St Mirren have started well and have a new manager so it will be a tough game.“It is a cup game and in those matches it is always about who is best on the day and we need to make sure it is us.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen charity to put on bingo fundraiser","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen charity is to hold a bingo fundraiser.Station House Media Unit, known as SHMU, will host a rock and roll bingo event next month to raise funds to fit out its new offices.The event will take place on September 25 in the Aberdeen Arts Centre from 7-9.30pm.SHMU serves the seven regeneration areas in Aberdeen by offering volunteer opportunities to gain experience in radio and video production, print publications and music production.The charity’s base on Station Road in Woodside is undergoing a refurbishment – after a £1 million grant from the Scottish Government Regeneration Capital Fund.All funds raised at the bingo event will go towards the charity’s Paving the Way to Woodside campaign, which aims to kit the new office out in equipment.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b752334e0906-884x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen sandwich shop cleans up with glowing report1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen sandwich shop that was criticised by inspectors earlier this year has now been given a glowing report.Aberdeen City Council sent an inspector for a routine check of Deja Vu food shop on Rose Street in March and their report said improvement was needed.The inspector expressed concern about the condition of some of the equipment and cleanliness.Several insects were spotted in the back kitchen area, which is not used for food preparation.The business’s owner, Roy Duncan, said he immediately called in pest controllers and the insects were removed within hours.He added that he spoke with the council inspectors in depth so he was able to attend to their concerns.According to the council, the premises was re-inspected on June 8 and they gave it a pass rating – meaning that all the original concerns had been dealt with.Mr Duncan, who has been in the food trade for 30 years, said: “It was quite a shock because, having been in the trade for so long, I had always passed these inspections and known exactly what gets you a pass and what doesn’t.

I’m forever blending meals.“It’s the biggest compliment to hear that Henry looks healthy.“He’s never been chubby – but he’s put on weight, we have our own scales to track his progress.“The training saved him from surgery – definitely.”The little boy has come a long way in his two years, having been delivered by caesarean section at 29 weeks after a diagnosis of in-utero growth restriction.He was born weighing just 1lb 9oz. Henry was fitted with a nasal gastric tube to keep him hydrated until he had recovered from a bout of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) but he became completely tube dependent.Lauren added: “We are looking to make the transition to solid foods so eventually I’ll start making the purées thicker.“The speech and language therapist has suggested we give him fizzy drinks to desensitise his tongue to different textures.“We are also working on getting him talking too, I can’t wait to hear his little stories.

Library has created an exhibition to showcase Sheriff William Watson – to help residents learn more about him.Industrial schools were set up across the country from the mid-19th Century, after it became widely recognised prison was not a suitable place for children who had committed a crime.Mr Watson established the first in 1841, choosing Aberdeen as the location to start the project.From there, he helped to set the organisations up across the country.Industrial schools were segregated by gender and most focused on teaching children a trade such as gardening, tailoring and shoemaking for boys and knitting, sewing, housework and washing for girls, although occasionally they did provide academic education.Aberdeen’s first industrial schools were run on a voluntary basis.However, in 1857 a law was passed to give magistrates the power to sentence children between the age of seven and 14 to a spell in one of the institutions.They were also entitled to claim government grants for children who were sent there, as well as receiving donations from members of the public or private companies.From 1932, the schools came to be known as approved schools.Born in 1796 as the son of a Lanarkshire sheep farmer, Watson was educated at Edinburgh University and took up the post of Sheriff-substitute of Aberdeenshire in March 1829, a job he stayed in for 37 years.The exhibition features a book by Sheriff Watson’s granddaughter Marion Angus titled “Sheriff Watson of Aberdeen: The Story of His Life and His Work for the Young”, dating back to 1913.The novel, which follows his work, also includes extracts from his diary.The exhibition also includes old articles from the Evening Express and Aberdeen Free Press, alongside aerial plans of some of the schools, such as the Female School of Industry, at Walker’s Court on Guestrow.Sheriff Watson’s display can be seen in the information centre at the Central Library on Rosemount Viaduct.Aberdeen City Council operational delivery convener Councillor John Wheeler said: “The story of Sheriff William Watson and his achievements is a very interesting one and it’s fantastic that one of our library staff members has put this exhibition together to give him greater recognition.“Watson is widely credited with the setting up of the first Industrial School in Scotland in 1841 which was designed to provide a solution to the problem of poor and destitute children wandering the streets, begging and committing crime.“Instead of jail, they were given a home and an education.“I’d recommend people to go to the exhibition and find out

dying","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAlana Russell arrived in the world weighing just 2lb 8oz, little more than a bag of sugar.She was born only a few weeks premature but had been unable to digest food while in the womb.The reason became clear when at two months old she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that can affect the digestive system.Mostly, however, it impairs the lungs, resulting in infections and the over-production of sticky mucus that hinders breathing.Doctors warned that Alana, from Kincorth, might not live to be five years old.At 33 and gravely ill in hospital, Alana was asked to consider signing a “do not resuscitate” form.Ever the fighter, she refused – but she did draft farewell letters to family and friends, ready to send.Now 34, Alana has never felt better – but only after receiving a double lung transplant, just one day from death.“In the years before that I’d been losing lots of weight,” she said.“It had got to the stage where I had to decide between eating and sleeping. I was up the whole night, coughing, it was exhausting.“I always knew I would one day need to have a lung transplant and just accepted it.”Alana attended Greenbrae Primary School and Oldmachar Academy and trained as a support worker.But CF started to impact her life. Chest and lung infections became the norm as her oxygen intake reduced to a third of normal.She had lived on her own since she was 17 after her mum moved to the US – and she was determined to stay independent.A “port” was created in her arm to make it easier to inject a cocktail of antibiotics.“I was in hospital a few times but it was just as easy for me to do myself at home,” she explained. “There is always someone worse off so I accept that everyone has their struggles too.”Eventually her CF team put her forward for a lung transplant.While she waited for donor organs to become available, her condition worsened.Alana was eventually admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and had to wear a mask for 24 hours to remove the build-up of carbon dioxide in her body.But her health continued to decline and she was moved to theiIntensive care unit and put on the emergency transplant list.The days passed but there was no call from the transplant centre.“The hospital told my family I was dying.“My dad (Alan) rode all the way up from Colchester on a motorbike in the pouring rain, while my sister Anna was by my side.”Alana saw a vision of her beloved nana, Alexzena, who died when Alana was 20.“She was at the foot of the bed. I knew she was there to protect me.”And then came word suitable donor lungs had been found. Alana was flown by air ambulance to hospital in Newcastle.“When I was going to theatre a medic commented I was very calm. I told him I am out of options. The last thing I said was please make my scars neat.”On December 5 2017 the transplant team worked on Alana for eight hours. Remarkably, she was home 18 days later and is now recovering and looking forward to life.“I am forever grateful to my donor. “Obviously it’s bittersweet because someone needs to lose someone in order for someone else to live, and yet, what better gift could you ever give?”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"msp welcomes creation of new jobs in aberdeen","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn MSP is “delighted” at the

former north-east hotel into a retreat for fishermen from across the world could be sunk.Proposals for the Bayview Hotel in Macduff are set to be discussed once again at the Banff and Buchan area committee next week.Susie Suri and her husband Jim Perry were originally given permission by Aberdeenshire Council to convert the hotel into a trawlermen’s refuge in January via delegated powers.However, the decision was made with the condition that the applicant would provide more information about noise pollution in relation to two air source heat pumps (ASHPs) that could affect neighbours.Environmental Health had originally submitted an objection regarding the ASHPs saying they weren’t up to standard.Concerns were raised the noise from the devices would impact those living near the Shore Street premises.A noise impact assessment was carried out, but deemed not appropriate because it provided insufficient evidence that there would be no unacceptable loss of amenity as a result of noise.As a result, officers had recommended the scheme for refusal – but councillors voted in favour of a delegated grant.Planners had praised the proposals for bringing the building back into use.Stephen Archer, head of infrastructure services at Aberdeenshire Council, said in a report: “Failure to submit information to an acceptable standard means Environmental Health has been unable to remove its earlier objection and agree that the matter is satisfactorily resolved.“The applicant has indicated that while not meeting British Standards, they believe the data provided meets ISO Standards and they are not prepared to commission a specialist noise consultant.“They have requested the application be referred back to committee to determine and the planning service considers this the only appropriate route now this impasse has been reached.”Planners are recommending refusal.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process.

The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities. In front of the parade was musician Pat Kenny playing haunting tones on a carnyx, an Iron Age Celtic war horn.On the green there were stands selling everything from soap to artwork and woolly bunnets to garden shrubs.As well as battle re-enactments and weapons demonstrations there were living history demonstrations and workshops where adults and children tried their hand at traditional crafts such as spinning, weaving, metalworking, woodwork, dressing up and blowing the carnyx.Children took part in the Lughnasa Games, featuring various tests of Celtic warrior skills.Brian MacLennan of Lochgilphead Community Council said: \u0026#8216The day was a massive success and I\u0026#8217ve had lots of positive feedback. Having a full programme of events in the arena as well as lots workshops for adults and youngsters to take part in throughout the day, has really made a big difference this year.\u0026#8217He added: \u0026#8216I would like to give a special mention to the 19th Argyll Scouts, the MS Centre and Lochgilphead Parish Church, without whom I\u0026#8217d have had no marquees, tables or chairs, and to Bluestone Gift Shop, the Grubs Up Recovery Cafe and the new Scottish Canals Steamer Terminal in Ardrishaig who all stepped in on the day before the festival with the additional funding and sponsorship that I needed to ensure the full scale festival could go ahead as planned.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217d also like to thank all the performers, providers and other contributors for making such a great day and would especially like to thank the volunteers who helped set up the site on Friday night and took everything down and away on Saturday evening.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m already thinking of ways to make the festival even bigger and better next year.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"imagination and colour at lochgilphead lego show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/08/18, 6:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA vast array of imaginative models were on display at the two-day Lochgilphead Lego Show.Lochgilphead Community Centre was the venue for the weekend of plastic brick magic on Saturday August 4 and Sunday August 5.Interactive workshops with Glasgow-based Bricks4Kids gave an insight into basic engineering using Lego, while the imagination room did exactly what the name suggests.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man. Greta Cameron talked about the early years of the Oyster Bar, established on the estate in the late 1970s by Christina\u0026#8217s brother Johnny Noble along with fish farmer Andy Lane.Piecing together records from her father\u0026#8217s journal, estate records and blending these with the recollections of the people of the estate, Christina has created a remarkable piece of work.This book is not just about the Nobles, but the Ardkinglas community, the people who make it and have made it and the story of how they lived and worked.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m very pleased that so many people have come along today for our launch party,\u0026#8217 said Christina.\u0026#8216Ardkinglas is a place that is very dear to me, and the place and the people have contributed to making me who I am today.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

The pitch at the school is too small to host even an under-13 game.‘For Mid Argyll Rugby Club to grow, it needs to have a home to create an identity. In recent years, plans and promises to create a rugby facility have always come to nothing and the game in Mid Argyll has suffered for it.\u0026#8216We have a Scottish School cup game on Tuesday August 28 and at the moment we are still looking for a venue. How can we compete with central belt schools, or even our neighbours in Oban, who have facilities provided by the council?’The club has steadily been developing fresh talent for more than five years, but with nowhere to play it cannot field a first 15 despite plenty of willing players.The pitch project, supported by Scottish Rugby and Argyll and Bute Rugby Development Officer Allan Wright, hopes to be open by autumn 2019.Another supporter of the project is Councillor Dougie Philand, who said: ‘I have been involved with senior rugby previously and having our own pitch was always a problem.\u0026#8216I would fully support any development or plans that would promote a permanent pitch and changing areas especially now when there is a resurgence in junior rugby. I would also be happy to be involved in any negotiations to obtain the land from the council.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scots guards colours go back to their argyll roots","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/08/18, 3:57 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe colours of a military regiment with deep connections to Inveraray are to be laid up in the Royal Burgh.The Scots Guards can trace their origins back to 1642 when, by order of King Charles I, the regiment was raised by Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll for service in Ireland, and was known as the Marquis of Argyll\u0026#8217s Royal Regiment.Later this month the old colours of the First Battalion Scots Guards will be laid up in a formal ceremony at Glenaray and Inveraray Parish Church.The battalion has seen service in all the major conflicts involving the British army since the Napoleonic Wars and the Scots Guards remain a first line infantry regiment of the British army.The church will be the home of the colours, and parish minister Reverend Dr Roderick Campbell said: \u0026#8216The laying up of colours happens roughly every 25 years for regiments of the line, but this will be the first time the Scots Guards has laid up old colours in Inveraray.\u0026#8217It is set to be a colourful occasion, with military top brass expected to join the Duke of Argyll, the Lord Lieutenant of Argyll and Bute and other dignitaries for the occasion.It will all happen at Glenaray and Inveraray Parish Church on Sunday August 26, with the service starting at 11.30am.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"jolomo exhibition opens at lochgilpheads archway gallery","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/08/18, 10:53 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead’s Archway Gallery opened a new exhibition on Saturday August 11 featuring the work of John Lowrie Morrison, commonly known as Jolomo.The exhibition, name Toward the Light, features familiar Arran and Kintyre seen in an unfamiliar view.The show is described on the Jolomo Facebook page as: ‘showing on home turf, John revisits some favourite places, but reveals them in a new light.’The exhibition was opened by Argyll and Bute MSP Mike Russell to an appreciative crowd who listened as John told tales of his artwork giving his own perception some light.Mr Russell said: \u0026#8216I was very honoured to be asked to open it and as ever bowled over by John’s artistry and his ability to express not just what he sees but what he feels.\u0026#8216I also like the slightly darker themes John has chosen this year – much more of sunsets and the ever changing light in the Kilbrannan Sound.\u0026#8217One visitor to the exhibition said: \u0026#8216It’s was amazing.

And he is well aware that Labour must recapture votes in places like the Doon Valley if it is to regain power at Holyrood and Westminster. “This is precisely the kind of constituency we need to win back,” admitted the Scottish Labour Party leader. He made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank. But time will tell whether or not this will bring voters back to the fold. Mr Leonard chatted amiably to lady volunteers at the Kirk Shop, in the middle of Dalmellington. There was clearly lots of goodwill for the Yorkshire-born politician. The affable Labour leader then moved on to Dalmellington Care Centre, where he planted a red rose to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. “My grandfather was a gardener, back in Leeds,” said Mr Leonard, as he wielded a spade. He heard about grassrooots co-operation in Dalmellinton among groups like The Zone and the care centre.  Mr Leonard said: “It’s the resilience of the people that’s keeping the Doon Valley going. “But it’s about time they were given a helping hand from government. “There are too many people living in poverty and on poverty pay. “We need investment in public services and we need to see communities having more control, with the possibility of community buy-outs.” Mr Leonard said only Labour is pledging a decade of investment. “We’re the only party opposing the austerity policies of the Tories, which are being passed on by the SNP.” He said the SNP’s own Growth Commission report revealed there would be even more austerity in an independent Scotland. And he was adamant: “The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to a second referendum on independence.”  Labour colleague Colin Smyth MSP said: “We’re seeing a growing frustration among voters on a debate focused on the constitution. “People want to see improvements in education and health.” Mr Leonard popped up to Bellsbank to see how streets are being transformed with ‘Balamory’ style painting of houses. In the afternoon, he visited the Sovereign Credit Union in Cumnock to hear about its services in the community. Then it was on to Tarbolton, to meet residents who are unhappy about their doctors’ surgery hours being cut, due to a shortage of GPs.

They resided in the old Tower on the hill, which is now in ruins. The Govans continued in possession of Cardrona until the latter end of the seventeenth century, when it was purchased by Mr Williamson, writer in Peebles, and Town Clerk of that burgh.

This was granted, and the work of demolition was soon begun. The roof was taken off and the chambers filled with earth, and in the course of a short time the effects of the weather made themselves apparent. The walls cracked in every direction, and large masses of the building fell.\nNext the crowbar was applied with great success and to make the appearance of an ancient ruin as near perfect as possible, a cartwheel was fixed in one of the largest rents, that the effect at a distance might be that of a venerable abbey.

The tradition in the family [Horseburgh] is that this part of the property was sold to defray the expenses of a lawsuit which had arisen between two brothers.\nAt Nether Horsburgh there are the remains of an old tower or keep, which used to be called Shillinglaw Tower. Tradition is silent respecting it, but it was probably built about the time the lands came into the possession of the Stewarts [sometime after 1550].

two million Muslims from around the world are beginning the five-day hajj pilgrimage.\nThey will circle Islam\u0026rsquos most sacred site, the cube-shaped Kaaba in the Saudi Arabian city of Mecca, and take part in a series of rituals intended to bring about greater humility and unity among Muslims.\nHere\u0026rsquos a look at the pilgrimage and what it means for Muslims:\nWhat is the purpose of the hajj?\nThe hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, and all able-bodied Muslims are required to perform it once in their lifetime. The hajj is seen as a chance to wipe clean past sins and start fresh. Many seek to deepen their faith on the hajj.\nDespite the physical challenges of the hajj, many people rely on canes or crutches and insist on walking the routes. Those who cannot afford the hajj are sometimes financed by charities or community leaders. Others save their entire lives to make the journey. A few even walk thousands of miles by foot to Saudi Arabia, taking months to arrive.\nWhat is the history of the hajj?\nWhile following a route the Prophet Mohammed once walked, the rites of hajj are believed to ultimately trace the footsteps of the prophets Ibrahim and Ismail \u0026ndash or Abraham and Ishmael as they are named in the Bible.\nMuslims believe Ibrahim\u0026rsquos faith was tested when God commanded him to sacrifice his only son Ismail. Ibrahim was prepared to submit to the command, but then God stayed his hand, sparing his son. In the Christian and Jewish version of the story, Abraham is ordered to kill his other son, Isaac.\nPilgrims also trace the path of Ibrahim\u0026rsquos wife, Hagar, who Muslims believe ran between two hills seven times searching for water for her dying son. Tradition holds that God then brought forth a spring that runs to this day. That spring, known as the sacred well of Zamzam, is believed to possess healing powers, and pilgrims often return from the hajj with bottles of its water as gifts.\nWhy is the Kaaba so important to Muslims?\nIslamic tradition holds that the Kaaba was built by Ibrahim and Ismail as a house of monotheistic worship thousands of years ago. Over the years, the Kaaba was reconstructed and attracted different kinds of pilgrims, including early Christians who once lived in the Arabian Peninsula. In pre-Islamic times, the Kaaba was used to house pagan idols worshipped by local tribes.\nMuslims do not worship the Kaaba, but it is Islam\u0026rsquos most sacred site because it represents the metaphorical house of God and the oneness of God in Islam. Observant Muslims around the world face towards the Kaaba during their five daily prayers.\nWhat are the rituals performed during the hajj?\nPilgrims enter into a state of spiritual purity known as \u0026ldquoihram that is aimed at shedding symbols of materialism, giving up worldly pleasures and focusing on the inner self over outward appearance.\nWomen forgo makeup and perfume and wear loose-fitting clothing and a head covering, while men dress in seamless, white terrycloth garments. The white garments are forbidden to contain any stitching \u0026mdash a restriction meant to emphasise the equality of all Muslims and prevent wealthier pilgrims from differentiating themselves with more elaborate garments.\nMuslims are forbidden from engaging in sexual intercourse, cutting their hair or trimming nails while in ihram. It is also forbidden for pilgrims to argue, fight or lose their tempers during the hajj. Inevitably, though, the massive crowds and physical exhaustion of the journey test pilgrims\u0026rsquo patience and tolerance.\nA pilgrim drinks water near the Grand Mosque (Dar Yasin/AP)\nThe first day of hajj\nThe hajj traditionally begins in Mecca, with a smaller \u0026ldquoumrah pilgrimage which can be performed year-round. To perform the umrah, Muslims circle the Kaaba counter-clockwise seven times while reciting supplications to God, then walk between the two hills travelled by Hagar. Mecca\u0026rsquos Grand Mosque, the world\u0026rsquos largest, encompasses the Kaaba and the two hills.\nBefore heading to Mecca, many pilgrims visit the city of Medina, where the Prophet Mohammed is buried and where he built his first mosque.\nThe second day of hajj\nAfter spending the night in the massive valley of Mina, the pilgrims head to Mount Arafat, some 12 miles east of Mecca, for the pinnacle of the pilgrimage.\nThey scale a hill called Jabal al-Rahma, or Mountain of Mercy. It is here where Mohammed delivered his final sermon, calling for equality and for Muslim unity. He reminded his followers of women\u0026rsquos rights and that every Muslim life and property is sacred.\nAround sunset, pilgrims head to an area called Muzdalifa, 5.5 miles west of Arafat. Many walk, while others use buses. They spend the night there and pick up pebbles along the way that will be used in a symbolic stoning of the devil back in Mina, where Muslims believe the devil tried to talk Ibrahim out of submitting to God\u0026rsquos will.\nThe final three days of hajj\nThe last three days of the hajj are marked by three events: a final circling of the Kaaba, casting stones in Mina and removing the ihram. Men often shave their heads at the end in a sign of renewal.\nThe final days of hajj coincide with Eid al-Adha, or the festival of sacrifice, celebrated by Muslims around the world to commemorate Ibrahim\u0026rsquos test of faith. During the three-day Eid, Muslims slaughter livestock and distribute the meat to the poor.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date()a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\u0027script\u0027,\u0027//www.google-analytics/analytics.js\u0027,\u0027ga\u0027)ga(\u0027create\u0027, \u0027UA-72310761-1\u0027, \u0027auto\u0027, {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027pacontentapi\u0027})ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027referrer\u0027, location.origin)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension1\u0027, \u0027By Aya Batrawy, Associated Press\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension2\u0027, \u002705d12653-a0bc-404e-a29e-678ea4322e23\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension3\u0027, \u0027paservice:news,paservice:news:world\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension6\u0027, \u0027story\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension7\u0027, \u0027composite\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension8\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension9\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.send\u0027, \u0027pageview\u0027, { \u0027location\u0027: location.href, \u0027page\u0027: (location.pathname + location.search + location.hash), \u0027title\u0027: \u0027What\\u2019s the purpose of the hajj pilgrimage?\u0027})\n"},{"url":null,"title":"costa del dalintober hosts campbeltown community regatta","story":"An active regatta sub committee of Kintyre Seasports Project met monthly  and twice in the month prior to the event.There was assistance from Jason McCallum at Keeping it Local, Krisp Print, Margaret Wallace TSI, Explore Campbeltown, Explore Kintyre and David McQuilken at Springbank.Sid Gallagher said: \u0026#8216Helen Gilchrist was a super master of ceremonies on the day.\u0026#8216Jamie McLean and Kenny Blair were power houses behind the Dalintober Beach Group organisation and contribution.\u0026#8216Jamie manually cleared half a ton of seaweed off the beach at 8am on Saturday morning.\u0026#8216The four RNLI crew members in the D-class lifeboat were on the water from 11am to 4pm despite a call out at 4am that morning and Campbeltown Coastguard also supported the event.\u0026#8217Groups involved were: Dalintober Beach group, Campbeltown Sailing Club with Guy Nicol on rescue boat, Campbeltown Sea Cadet Unit, Campbeltown Dive Group,  Campbeltown Stand Up Paddle Board group, Kintyre Canoe Club, Grant Logan Windsurfing, Kintyre Youth Cafe, Police Scotland Youth Volunteers.Mr Gallagher added: \u0026#8216Campbeltown Sailing Club members Ian and Alison Paton and their two-year-old daughter Florence came up from York specially for the regatta.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"foursome take carradales torrisdale cup","story":"The weather held and the course was in great condition receiving many positive comments following a tough season of extreme weather conditions for greenkeeper Robert Strang.The club thanked Glen Scotia Distillery for its very generous sponsorship of the event and their continued support of the club.Congratulations go to the winning team: Ryan McConnachie, Alan Robertson, Alistair McMillan and John McMillan (48 strokes) Runners-up: Craig Ramsay, Jim Clark, John Ramsay and Roy McKinven (49 strokes) and third placed: Jamie Campbell, Lorna Campbell, Gillian Kitson and Jamie Robertson (50 strokes).Other results: Nearest the pin in two strokes at the 4th: Vince Jordan.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8195899.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.

Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.

According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated. There was public support for it in Dunbar and it will be good to see it going ahead and I am hopeful the outcome will be positive.  Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe order has been made and we are just awaiting the appropriate signage, which should be within the next month.  \u0026ldquoThe order will be for an 18-month period and is an experimental order.  If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.  The 20mph speed limit starts to the west of Edinburgh Road\u0026rsquos junction with Shore Road and Beveridge Row.  To the east, it comes into force as drivers make their way along the A1087."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/4108040.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=12\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"your-chance-to-apply-for-thousands-of-pounds-of-support-for-your-charity","story":"  Last year, donations totalling almost \u0026pound300,000 were made up and down the country on behalf of Newsquest Media Group, one of the UK\u0027s largest publishers and owners of the East Lothian Courier.  The Gannett Foundation UK, which makes the grants, has given more than \u0026pound3 million to help charitable community causes all over Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the last 10 years.  One of the successful applicants last year was Lothian Autistic Society, which received \u0026pound5,000 for its East Lothian Basecamp service. This service supports children, aged 5-13, with autism and helps them develop social communication and social interaction skills through structured themed group and play sessions.  The foundation supports charities with projects which take a creative approach to fundamental issues such as education and neighbourhood improvements, economic development, youth development, local problem-solving, assistance to the disadvantaged or disabled, environmental conservation and cultural enrichment.  And it values projects that bring lasting benefits to local communities.  A spokesman said: \"While preference may be given to ideas which create a durable legacy for the community, judges will consider single events or projects of limited duration that otherwise meet the criteria.\"  Typically grants are made for substantial projects which require and merit awards of between \u0026pound5,000 and \u0026pound10,000, although applications can be for any size of grant and level of ambition.  The foundation will join with other contributors to support elements of larger projects, but prefers to be in a position of making a donation which will fund a project in its entirely or which constitutes the final instalment to complete a project.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals (Trussell Trust stats).  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent (April 16 to March 17 was 37 per cent increase).  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a variety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8263378.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations.

He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.

Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington. Mr Wallace said: \u0026ldquoIt made a huge difference \u0026ndash the kids loved seeing them and they were great."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8263446.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-headteacher-wants-to-make-knox-academy-a-flagship-school-for-east-lothian","story":"  Susan Cook took charge at the Haddington school this week after moving from Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Trinity Academy, where she was acting headteacher.

She said: \u0026ldquoI would like to make Knox Academy a flagship school in East Lothian \u0026ndash Scotland, potentially.  \u0026ldquoI want all young people to leave to a positive destination but be healthy and happy as they move through the school and really enjoy their school experience.  \u0026ldquoI want pupils to enjoy education in the widest sense, not just the curriculum but wider activities, and to develop as rounded individuals when they leave school to meet the demands of an ever-changing society.  Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoI found when I was at Trinity Academy, the headteacher and the senior leadership team were in the middle of the school. With an open foyer, you saw pupils pass.  \u0026ldquoI think it could be easy to shut the door and stay in the room. That is not what I want to do, I want to get out and about.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot really like sitting about, I want to engage with people.

She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.  Currently the school is undergoing a large-scale expansion, which is due to be fully complete in early November.  Ahead of the new term starting, a section of the extension has been opened, which will give access to six new classrooms.  More than \u0026pound10 million is being spent on the extension, which includes a new two-storey L-shaped block to the east side of the school.  It will not only be home to new classrooms but also a home economics department, new library and learning centre with a dedicated IT space, and additional PE changing rooms.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.

Here\u0026rsquos a look at the pilgrimage and what it means for Muslims:  What is the purpose of the hajj?  The hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, and all able-bodied Muslims are required to perform it once in their lifetime. The hajj is seen as a chance to wipe clean past sins and start fresh. Many seek to deepen their faith on the hajj.  Despite the physical challenges of the hajj, many people rely on canes or crutches and insist on walking the routes. Those who cannot afford the hajj are sometimes financed by charities or community leaders. Others save their entire lives to make the journey. A few even walk thousands of miles by foot to Saudi Arabia, taking months to arrive.  What is the history of the hajj?  While following a route the Prophet Mohammed once walked, the rites of hajj are believed to ultimately trace the footsteps of the prophets Ibrahim and Ismail \u0026ndash or Abraham and Ishmael as they are named in the Bible.  Muslims believe Ibrahim\u0026rsquos faith was tested when God commanded him to sacrifice his only son Ismail. Ibrahim was prepared to submit to the command, but then God stayed his hand, sparing his son. In the Christian and Jewish version of the story, Abraham is ordered to kill his other son, Isaac.  Pilgrims also trace the path of Ibrahim\u0026rsquos wife, Hagar, who Muslims believe ran between two hills seven times searching for water for her dying son. Tradition holds that God then brought forth a spring that runs to this day. That spring, known as the sacred well of Zamzam, is believed to possess healing powers, and pilgrims often return from the hajj with bottles of its water as gifts.  Why is the Kaaba so important to Muslims?  Islamic tradition holds that the Kaaba was built by Ibrahim and Ismail as a house of monotheistic worship thousands of years ago. Over the years, the Kaaba was reconstructed and attracted different kinds of pilgrims, including early Christians who once lived in the Arabian Peninsula. In pre-Islamic times, the Kaaba was used to house pagan idols worshipped by local tribes.  Muslims do not worship the Kaaba, but it is Islam\u0026rsquos most sacred site because it represents the metaphorical house of God and the oneness of God in Islam. Observant Muslims around the world face towards the Kaaba during their five daily prayers.  What are the rituals performed during the hajj?  Pilgrims enter into a state of spiritual purity known as \u0026ldquoihram that is aimed at shedding symbols of materialism, giving up worldly pleasures and focusing on the inner self over outward appearance.  Women forgo makeup and perfume and wear loose-fitting clothing and a head covering, while men dress in seamless, white terrycloth garments. The white garments are forbidden to contain any stitching \u0026mdash a restriction meant to emphasise the equality of all Muslims and prevent wealthier pilgrims from differentiating themselves with more elaborate garments.  Muslims are forbidden from engaging in sexual intercourse, cutting their hair or trimming nails while in ihram. It is also forbidden for pilgrims to argue, fight or lose their tempers during the hajj. Inevitably, though, the massive crowds and physical exhaustion of the journey test pilgrims\u0026rsquo patience and tolerance.  The first day of hajj  The hajj traditionally begins in Mecca, with a smaller \u0026ldquoumrah pilgrimage which can be performed year-round. To perform the umrah, Muslims circle the Kaaba counter-clockwise seven times while reciting supplications to God, then walk between the two hills travelled by Hagar. Mecca\u0026rsquos Grand Mosque, the world\u0026rsquos largest, encompasses the Kaaba and the two hills.  Before heading to Mecca, many pilgrims visit the city of Medina, where the Prophet Mohammed is buried and where he built his first mosque.  The second day of hajj  After spending the night in the massive valley of Mina, the pilgrims head to Mount Arafat, some 12 miles east of Mecca, for the pinnacle of the pilgrimage.  They scale a hill called Jabal al-Rahma, or Mountain of Mercy. It is here where Mohammed delivered his final sermon, calling for equality and for Muslim unity. He reminded his followers of women\u0026rsquos rights and that every Muslim life and property is sacred.  Around sunset, pilgrims head to an area called Muzdalifa, 5.5 miles west of Arafat. Many walk, while others use buses. They spend the night there and pick up pebbles along the way that will be used in a symbolic stoning of the devil back in Mina, where Muslims believe the devil tried to talk Ibrahim out of submitting to God\u0026rsquos will.  The final three days of hajj  The last three days of the hajj are marked by three events: a final circling of the Kaaba, casting stones in Mina and removing the ihram. Men often shave their heads at the end in a sign of renewal.  The final days of hajj coincide with Eid al-Adha, or the festival of sacrifice, celebrated by Muslims around the world to commemorate Ibrahim\u0026rsquos test of faith. During the three-day Eid, Muslims slaughter livestock and distribute the meat to the poor."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/7931730.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"deeann-fitzpatrick-bound-and-gagged-scottish-government-agency-worker-loses-case","story":"  DeeAnn Fitzpatrick claimed she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland.  At an employment tribunal in Aberdeen in June the 49-year-old Canadian national said she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards, claiming she was targeted with sexual harassment and for being a woman, as well as over her age.  The abuse was said to have taken place between 2015 and 2017 while she was based in the government body\u0027s Scrabster office in the Highlands and continued after she was signed off.  In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick alleged she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.  However it is understood the tribunal was unable to consider that allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.  The employment tribunal ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.  In its judgment the tribunal said it could not agree whether the cards could be said to have been likely to come from current colleagues.  In a statement the Fitzpatrick family said: \"The Fitzpatrick family are hugely disappointed with the result of the Tribunal.\"  However they said the decision was \"not unexpected\" as the alleged restraint incident could not be taken into account.

The council said it is the first local authority in the UK to offer free sanitary provision in all of its public buildings.  It comes after the local authority introduced free sanitary products in its secondary schools last August, with young women accessing more than 13,000 free sanitary towels and tampons while at school in the last year.  Council leader Joe Cullinane said: \"Sanitary products are a necessity, not a choice. I wish for no women or girl here in North Ayrshire to find themselves in the embarrassing and often degrading situation of having to use improper sanitary protection simply because they cannot afford it.  \"After all, periods are not exempt from poverty - they don\u0027t take account of what is in your pocket or purse. Therefore, it is absolutely right that we should look at ways in which to tackle this gendered inequality.  \"This latest announcement in our period poverty programme aims to help address the issue and make period poverty history in North Ayrshire.\"  A study published by girls\u0027 rights charity Plan International UK earlier this year found that 45% of those living in Scotland said they have been forced to use makeshift sanitary wear including socks or newspapers because they have struggled to buy products.  The Scottish Government is rolling out a project to provide free sanitary products to women from low-income households across Scotland following a pilot scheme in Aberdeen, while free sanitary products will also be available to those at school, college or university from this month.  Scottish Labour MSP Monica Lennon, who is bringing forward a Member\u0027s Bill to create a statutory duty for free provision of sanitary products, welcomed the scheme in North Ayrshire.  She said: \"Councillor Cullinane and North Ayrshire Council are leading the way on ending period poverty.  \"Access to sanitary products should be a right, regardless of your income, which is why I am moving ahead with plans for legislation to introduce a universal system of free access to sanitary products for everyone in Scotland.  \"I\u0027m delighted that North Ayrshire will extend free sanitary product provision to all of its public buildings and I hope other organisations will follow their lead.  \"No-one should face the indignity of being unable to access these essential products to manage their period.\""},{"url":null,"title":"tom-gordon-nicola-sturgeon-is-running-out-of-time-to-make-her-call-on-indyref2","story":"  Many will be SNP members. Local SNP MPs Stewart Hosie and Chris Law are among those due to attend. But it is not an SNP event.  Instead, it has been organised by the All Under One Banner group, partly out of frustration that Nicola Sturgeon is not being forceful enough in pursuing another vote.  The tensions are such some Yes supporters even plan to demonstrate at the SNP conference in October to exhort the First Minister to use the \u0026lsquotriple-lock\u0026rsquo mandate she says she has to call a referendum by 2021.  At the last SNP conference in June, Ms Sturgeon tried to dampen down calls for a fresh vote, saying the focus should be on converting No voters, not the date. \u0026ldquoLet\u0026rsquos stop obsessing all of the time about when we might get the chance to vote on independence again, she said.  But the obsession never went away. Nor is it really an obsession. It is a completely reasonable thing for Yes supporters to contemplate given that mandate has a limited shelf-life.  But as the former SNP cabinet minister Alex Neil argued this week, the game\u0026rsquos a bogie. Theresa May will never give the Scottish Parliament the power to hold a referendum.  She blanked Holyrood\u0026rsquos request for a so-called Section 30 order before the last general election.  She would certainly do so again, not least because she is now reliant on the ultra-Unionist DUP to stay in power. Even if she were toppled, no new Tory or Labour PM would be any keener to add a fight over Scottish independence to an in-tray already bursting with Brexit.  Impatient Yessers may argue for a unilateral, Catalan-style referendum, and to hell with a Section 30 order.  But besides looking desperate, such a vote is open to legal challenge. A Catalan-style referendum wouldn\u0026rsquot end in independence, it would end in the courts.  Given the improbability of a Section 30 order, it falls to Ms Sturgeon to manage expectations and prepare folk for an anti-climax.  So far she\u0026rsquos kicked the can down the road. After being blindsided by the last election, she \u0026ldquoreset her March 2017 plan for a Brexit-related referendum and promised a new \u0026ldquoprecise timescale this autumn.  Now, with Brexit still a hazy mess, she has hinted she might not have enough information to say anything concrete this autumn after all.  But while kicking the can is a time-honoured political device, Ms Sturgeon is fast running out of road.  There are snap elections, but no snap referendums. Each referendum is governed by its own particular Act of parliament, and that takes time.  There also has to be six-month gap between the legislation and the vote to allow for lead campaign groups to be set up and for a campaign period.  The last independence referendum was governed by a 2013 Holyrood Act which started life a full 18 months before the vote.  READ MORE: British establishment will use dirty tricks to stop independence  Ms Sturgeon published a draft bill for another referendum in October 2016 for a three-month consultation. It is essentially a list of tweaks to the 2013 Act, which was to be used as a template. But it wasn\u0026rsquot introduced at Holyrood, so would still face a parliamentary passage of around nine months - opposition MSPs would be sure to take their time mulling all of the 100 or so variations to the 2013 Act.  The Electoral Commission says a referendum cannot be the same day as the Holyrood election, so we need to work backwards from there to estimate the theoretical deadline for calling one in this parliament.  It would not be spring 2021 in case it became entangled with the Holyrood vote. In 2017, a Tory surge in the local election rolled into a Tory surge at the general\u0026nbspelection. Ms Sturgeon would not want to see a No vote in a referendum snowball into a rout for the SNP at Holyrood.  So the latest practical date for a referendum is likely to be autumn 2020. But, critically, this would have to be preceded by 15 to 18 months of legislation and campaigning. That means Ms Sturgeon would have to start the ball rolling by the middle of next year to hold one, in theory.  So if, by summer 2019, she hasn\u0026rsquot called for a second referendum (albeit probably in vain), it will be obvious to all that it isn\u0026rsquot happening.  If she pretended otherwise and insisted it was still a live possibility she would be accused of treating people like fools who couldn\u0026rsquot read a calendar or do basic arithmetic.  Similarly, if she demanded a referendum at the end of the electoral cycle, it would be seen as a naked gimmick to gee up support for the SNP going into 2021.  She could, in theory, activate her draft referendum bill sooner without actually, calling for vote, introducing it to parliament as a \u0026lsquocontingency measure\u0026rsquo if needed.  She would have to leave the date blank, however. Theresa May tried that with the EU Withdrawal Bill, which initially referred to \u0026ldquoexit day. But after much criticism about this being weak, dodgy and ridiculous, the government included the date. If Ms Sturgeon tried the same trick, she would risk the same accusations of weakness, flakiness and abuse of process.  She would also be reminded Alex Salmond named the day of the 2014 referendum when he introduced the associated bill at Holyrood.  The First Minister\u0026rsquos headache is that if she comes out and declares a second referendum dead in this parliament, she risks antagonising an awful lot of Yes supporters who were counting on her to deliver it. Some might even have believed that \u0026lsquotriple-lock\u0026rsquo mandate stuff.  There would be recriminations, accusations she let the side down, gave up too soon, squandered her chance, blinked first against one of the weakest PMs in British history.  Internal party discipline would fray. It would also be hard to go into 2021 asking for a fresh mandate after admitting she couldn\u0026rsquot cash in the last one. But pretence risks antagonising people too. SNP members would not appreciate being left looking daft on a hill they had followed her half- way up.  Coming clean is the better option. It\u0026rsquos not a good look for a leader, especially one proposing a bold new destiny, to let drift and inertia make the decision for her. A shrug and \u0026lsquoOh, would you look at the time?\u0026rsquo isn\u0026rsquot quite as inspiring as \u0026lsquoFreedom!\u0026rsquo  She can\u0026rsquot keep everyone happy. But that\u0026rsquos life. The crunch is coming, and it\u0026rsquos coming fast."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-to-offer-his-views-on-the-media-in-edinburgh-tv-festival-speech","story":"  Following his speech the Labour leader will be interviewed by award-winning actor and writer Maxine Peake and face questions from an audience.

We, the people, must decide in a people\u0026rsquos vote on the final Brexit deal."},{"url":null,"title":"as-hopes-of-indyref2-fade-are-we-seeing-the-birth-of-new-snp","story":"  Some of us weren\u0027t quite so complimentary, of course. The economic orthodoxy upon which the Growth Commission was built \u0026ndash balancing the books through public spending restraint \u0026ndash bore an awkward resemblance to the belt-tightening policies of George Osborne after 2010. SNP left-wingers, like the former MP George Kerevan, were dismayed that the Commission failed to recommend an independent currency, leaving Scotland chained to the interest rate policies of the Bank of England for the first decade of independence.  The document largely endorsed the claim by Unionists that an independent Scotland would be born with a headline \u0026pound13 billion deficit. Labour called it \u0026ldquoausterity on stilts. The economic blogger most Nationalists love to hate, Kevin Hague, put the tin hat on it by wholeheartedly embracing the Growth Commission\u0027s analysis. The Institute for Fiscal Studies then commended the SNP\u0027s new realism, while predicting that it would mean another 10 years of austerity.  However, since its publication, I have to admit that Andrew Wilson\u0027s report has had some positive political impact. It does seem to have attracted interest in independence from the business community, who are at sea over Brexit and looking for answers. It probably reassured Scottish pensioners and home owners worried about the inflationary risks of independence. The report certainly won praise from Wilson\u0027s many friends in the media, and earned the SNP a deal of favourable coverage, which isn\u0027t to be sniffed at.  But as far as independence is concerned, the SGC hardly shifted the dial. It wasn\u0027t an inspirational programme and nor was it the SNP\u0027s Clause 4 moment. It didn\u0027t lead anywhere. The SNP has succeeded in repudiating the compendious 2013 Independence White Paper, \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos Future, while offering nothing very positive in its place \u0026ndash at least in terms of a rallying cry. Nor can it just be ignored: it was never intended as a disposable discussion paper. The Growth Commission will be the great woolly mammoth in the room at the SECC in October. It is bound to surface one way or another.  The puzzle is why it saw the light of day at all. Why offer a whole boat-load of hostages to fortune on the eve of an expected referendum campaign? The optimistic Keynesian 2013 White Paper, for all its faults, was a successful campaigning document, not unlike Labour\u0027s 2017 General Election manifesto. It took Yes to the very brink of victory. Why did Nicola Sturgeon authorise the publication of its antithesis at the moment she is trying to build support for another crack at independence? At the very least the Growth Commission has created a rift in the movement when you would expect her to be seeking unity.  Well, one heretical thought is that the Commission was never intended to kick-start a campaign, but was part of the process of building down expectations of an imminent referendum. It was as political downer, a dose of Tramadol to quell the delinquent spirits of indyref enthusiasts, who believe that independence is a matter of political will, inspiration and taking politics to the streets.  Nicola Sturgeon has shown no sign over the summer of preparing for independence. Back when the 2013 White Paper was published, the SNP staged high-profile conferences around Scotland bringing together the disparate elements of Scottish civil society \u0026ndash not just SNP members \u0026ndash to debate its contents. I remember this because I was asked to chair one of them. There\u0027s been nothing like that this time, only internal party discussions.  Some Nationalists are beginning to wonder whether Nicola Sturgeon really wants a referendum at all in the near future. The SNP is supremely powerful in Scotland, with Labour in confusion and the Conservatives discredited by Brexit. Why would she risk all that on a throw of the dice? Was she so burned by the last attempt at a referendum, losing a third of her MPs, that she\u0027s lost faith in referendums?  The SNP\u0027s objective is, of course, independence, but political parties are first of all about getting and retaining power. About keeping bums on seats. Losing elected members, MPs and MSPs, is painful: it means close friends losing their livelihoods. The party is still in mourning for the casualties of 2017\u0026ndash like Angus Robertson and Alex Salmond.  There would, of course, be dismay in the party if Sturgeon were to shelve independence again in October. This is likely to be the most divisive SNP conference since the rows over devolution in the 1990s. But Nicola Sturgeon is not in any political danger. There is no conceivable rival in the cabinet. Potential dissidents like the deputy leadership contender, councillor Chris McEleny, are remote from Holyrood politics. Nor are there organised dissenting groups in the SNP \u0026ndash no \u0026ldquoMandate Group or \u0026ldquoIndependence Research Group. Perhaps there should be in future.  Moreover, there will be a lot to distract the troops in October. The Tories are deeply divided and Theresa May will be lucky to survive. If she tries to breathe life into the Chequers compromise she will be roasted by the legions of hard Brexit Moggists. If she abandons her White Paper, and gives in to No Deal Brexit, there will be a huge public outcry and further resignations.  Over at Labour, the row over anti-Semitism looks set to dominate the conference, but not in the way Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos MP critics hope. The Labour leader\u0027s many admirers in the party, who believe none of it, will use the conference to push for mandatory reselection of MPs to clear out the right. This could split the party.  Coming last allows Nicola Sturgeon to focus the SNP conference on not being Labour, or the Tories, but instead being the leading Remain party. She may not actually endorse a People\u0027s Vote, but she could say that a No Deal is unthinkable and that Article 50 should be delayed if there is no agreement on Britain\u0027s future trading arrangements with the EU. Opposing Brexit will crowd out discussion of indyref2  So, if the Growth Commission was a way of levelling with party enthusiasts \u0026ndash of saying that the economics just aren\u0027t right for independence at the moment \u0026ndash it would make some political sense. The risk, of course, is that it might be too successful, and make it very difficult to reconstruct the 2014 coalition in future. The Yes campaign managed to galvanise voters in working class communities who had largely given up on electoral politics. Voter registration in 2014 was 97 per cent and turnout on the day was 85 per cent.  It would be hard to build that kind of engagement on a programme that has spending constraint as its core economic strategy. However, a dose of \u0026ldquoeconomic realism might consolidate the SNP\u0026rsquos hold on Holyrood. We may he seeing the beginning of the end of the SNP as a radical, insurgent party, and the birth of what might be called New SNP."},{"url":null,"title":"its-plane-simple-why-more-women-should-take-up-woodwork","story":"  The Chippendale International School of Furniture in East Lothian has been turning out top craftsmen for more than 25 years, but few women are applying to the not-for-profit institution.  This year, six women enrolled in the professional 30-week course which accommodates 25 students. Last year, just three women enrolled and in each of the two years before only five women took up the trade.  School principal Anselm Fraser believes women have a \u0026ldquonatural affinity with woodworking and he wants to encourage more to apply.  This year, Honor Dalrymple was named student of the year after producing work which Fraser described as \u0026ldquoexemplary and \u0026ldquosublime.  Dalrymple, from Gifford, near Haddington, studied civil engineering at the University of Bristol and then worked in London as a structural engineer.  She said that it was sometimes a frustrating profession, with structural engineers only required to work on \u0026ldquoaspects of a project, rather than from start to finish.  She undertook a short woodworking course in London, which set her on a path to the Chippendale school.  \u0026ldquoComing to this school was an obvious choice for me \u0026ndash the family home where I grew up is just a couple of miles down the road, she said.  School principal Fraser said: \u0026ldquoThe beauty of Honor\u0026rsquos work, which included a cabinet, oak desk and chairs, was exemplary. Her designs were excellent, and the quality of her making was sublime.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod very much like more women to consider a career in woodworking and, we believe, women often have a more natural affinity to combining the design aesthetics and practical sides of the trade.  \u0026ldquoThe school has been involved in campaigns to raise the profile of woodworking generally with careers advisers in schools, because few realise that furniture design is a career option for young students.  This year\u0026rsquos crop of students came from the UK, USA, Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Falkland Islands, Singapore, India, Ireland and Trinidad and Tobago.  Former student Vanessa Johnston, from Seattle, graduated this year and is in the process of setting up her own company in Scotland.  She was awarded a commendation by the Chippendale Society to mark the 300th birthday of celebrated furniture maker Thomas Chippendale.  Dr Adam Bowett, chairman of the society, said Johnston\u0026rsquos work showed \u0026ldquooutstanding craftsmanship and beautiful design.  Johnston was previously a marketing director and graphic designer and began to develop her skills while living on a houseboat. \u0026ldquoI renovated it, building cabinets, and even adding a second storey, she said.  Another former student, Archana Pai, has now returned to India to take up the trade, making her one of only a handful of furniture designers in the country.  Pai, who is in her early 40s, said: \u0026ldquoI consider that men and women are equally suited to woodworking. Interest and passion in woodworking matters most, to excel in this field. I was always interested in designing and making my own furniture and never satisfied with the work done by others, hence decided to learn the skills.  \u0026ldquoI chose to study in Scotland because, to join the Chippendale School, there is no age limit and there is no requirement of prior experience or education in woodworking. This suited me perfectly.  Pai was previously a chartered accountant and now plans to set up a workshop in Bangalore where she lives with her husband.  She added: \u0026ldquoI specialise in fine woodworking using solid wood. I want to ensure that the furniture made by me is sustainable and is also aesthetic.  Fraser, who founded the school 25 years ago, and named it after Thomas Chippendale, said many women have also blazed a trail in the profession.  He cites Glasgow School of Art graduate Margaret MacDonald Mackintosh, Irish-born architect and designer Eileen Gray and French furniture designer Charlotte Perriand.  \u0026ldquoThey helped to inspire some of the biggest artistic movements, including Art Deco and modernism, Fraser said.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod also like to encourage more women into woodworking because it is, primarily, about artistic design rather than brute hard work. Modern machinery takes much of the hard work out of woodworking.  \u0026ldquoSo, if you\u0026rsquore a women thinking about furniture design and making as a career, it really is no longer a man\u0026rsquos world. The number of women woodworkers is growing, and that\u0026rsquos something we\u0026rsquod like to applaud and encourage.  FURNITURE DESIGN THROUGH THE AGES  By Anselm Fraser, principal, The Chippendale International School of Furniture  In considering the history of furniture design, we need only look to a small Neolithic settlement on Orkney. Skara Brae consists of eight dwellings, linked together by a series of passages, and dating to between 3200BC and 2200BC. Remarkably, each house has surviving beds, cupboards, dressers and shelves.  The only reason they\u0026rsquove survived, making them some of the world\u0026rsquos oldest furniture, is that Orkney didn\u0026rsquot (and doesn\u0026rsquot) have trees. All the Stone Age furniture is aptly made entirely from stone.  Maybe not very comfortable, but which underlines that furniture designers have been designing furniture for over 4,000 years.  Hardly surprising therefore that we\u0026rsquove ended up with comfortable chairs, beds, tables and chairs \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquove had many centuries to get the basic designs right.  The fact is that furniture design has been around since the dawn of time, and we have examples of ancient woodworking by the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and Chinese.  For example, archaeologists recently found a remarkably-intact furniture shop in Pompeii, largely destroyed by Mount Vesuvius in 779AD. It would have been the Ikea of its day. Wood has always been one of our most plentiful resources, and one that\u0026rsquos relatively easy to fashion into chairs and tables.  All that\u0026rsquos really changed over the millennia is our ability to more easily work with wood, with modern equipment and machinery taking away much of the donkey work.  And technology continues to impact on woodworking. For example, computer-aided design or 3D printing, where a particular design for a piece of furniture can be built in miniature."},{"url":null,"title":"sunday-herald-diary-a-rude-introduction-the-great-owl-conspiracy-eagle-elegy-the-prince-of-pails-and-an-air-raising-tale","story":"  My meeting with the rudest man ever, as he was dubbed after a TV appearance, began innocently enough. Looking for somewhere new to eat for five of us \u0026ndash and with a freshly-minted Dine discount card \u0026ndash the choice was the Weston Tavern in Kilmaurs in Ayrshire, which had just won some food award and had rave reviews about its quality, and the promise of 25 per cent off seemed perfect for this skinflint. It\u0026rsquos a small place, under relatively new ownership, transformed from a bit of dump. It was Tuesday and the added appeal was that steaks were 40 per cent below normal price so, what with the card and the price slash, it was almost as if they were paying us to eat there.  All went well, the food was excellent, until the bill came and the Dine card was proffered \u0026ndash and refused. I asked to see the manager. Enter, you\u0026rsquove guessed it, the aforementioned rude legend. He is John Cairns, the proprietor, who earned his moniker on the show First Dates last year, after 10 minutes in saying to his blind date he didn\u0026rsquot fancy him and told him to leave before the main course was served. John, who is a beefy chap, then continued to eat his meal alone, the cameras recording him finishing his steak, probably because it wasn\u0026rsquot 40 per cent off and he wasn\u0026rsquot going to waste his cash \u0026ndash and obviously didn\u0026rsquot have a Dine membership.  Back at the Weston, John was adamant that the card wouldn\u0026rsquot pass and went off to return shortly after with 10 printed pages about why this was the case. The judgment of Solomon was shorter. It was a bit of a let-down. But what was the biggest disappointment of the evening was that John was not in the slightest bit rude.  A MYSTERIOUS DEATH AND THE OWL THEORY  If you haven\u0026rsquot seen the true life crime documentary The Staircase on Netflix you really should. It focuses on the case of successful novelist Michael Peterson who was convicted in 2003 of murdering his wife Kathleen by attacking her with a poker-like implement, causing her to fall down the stairs where she died, allegedly after a few more blows. The cameras were given total access and it\u0026rsquos a captivating series in which not only Peterson stars, but his brilliant defence attorney David Rudolf takes centre stage.  The crime happened in Durham, North Carolina, and it\u0026rsquos as much a portrait of the place as an anatomy of a murder. Or was it? You may conclude that while Peterson isn\u0026rsquot the most engaging character, the evidence against him is not totally convincing. Well, lawyer Rudolf is coming to Glasgow in October, to the O2 Arena, with his show Inside The Staircase: Lies, Fake Science and the Owl Theory. With every famous crime or tragedy comes a conspiracy theory and this one is that a giant owl somehow got into the couple\u0026rsquos lavish house, or attacked Kathleen in the garden, the end result being her fall to her death. Reputable \u0026ldquoexperts have testified that a small feather found in her hair (and not tested) could have been an owl\u0026rsquos and that wounds on her head looked like they came from three-taloned feet rather than a blunt instrument. Rudolph is convinced. I\u0026rsquoll make my judgment after the show.  THE EAGLE HAS LANDED  A demo of two songs from my old pal Jim Wilkie arrives in the post, the second one, The Great Gillie, a wonderful tribute to the late Alan Gilzean, arguably the greatest-ever Scottish centre forward. Gillie, who died last month, scored 169 goals in 190 games for Dundee and in the 1961-62 season, when the Dee won the league championship, knocked in 27, including four against Rangers at Ibrox. Jim\u0026rsquos tribute to him would bring a tear to a glass eye, and not just a Dee one. He manages to bring in Paul Simon, Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe too. And \u0026ldquoAlan Gilzean and Jimmy Greaves and the kind of magic Michael Marra weaves, a reference to when Gillie was \u0026ldquoKing of White Hart Lane. The hook, \u0026ldquoThere we were Gay Gordon [Smith] dancing on the wing, and everyone could tell a different story, of the great Gillie, rising like an eagle, while we the crowd, stood watching from the ground. It\u0026rsquos true too.  JINGS! CRIVVENS! AND HELP MA FAT BOB!  I can quash the rumour that DC Thomson is to sponsor the bucket Leeds United manager Marcelo Bielsa sits on at home games. As far as I know he has never read an Oor Wullie strip. I\u0026rsquom not sure, either, if he has read the works of his translator, Salim Lamrani, the most over-qualified man in the English Championship. Lamrani is a PhD, prolific author, a former academic, a left-winger with specialisation in relations between Cuba and the USA. He\u0026rsquos multilingual and good looking too, the swine. My former colleague Andy Whitaker is a big Leeds fan and he\u0026rsquos now John McDonnell\u0026rsquos spin doctor. Well, one out of two out ain\u0026rsquot bad.  AIR ON A MISSING G STRING  Finland is currently celebrating its 100th anniversary of independence so, as a comparatively recent county, we can perhaps forgive them for holding the World Air Guitar Championships. But then again, no! This ridiculous event \u0026ndash which crowds turn up and pay money to see \u0026ndash kicks off on Wednesday in Oulu. The defending champion is Matt \"Aristotle\u0026rsquo Burns from the US, a skinny geek who looks as if donning a real guitar would break his neck. Or you can watch a previous champ, Justin \u0026lsquoNordic Thunder\u0026rsquo Howard, go through his act. He, apparently, has had two surgeries after suffering air guitar injuries. Whiplash from repetitive hair twirling? Backlash from the bursting of imaginary strings? Honestly, the things I have to suffer, dear reader, just so you won\u0026rsquot have to.  BUM NOTE  Still on music, circa 1979, I gave a bit of advice to young Rory: \u0026ldquoStick to the day job son. This band thing will never work. It did take almost 40 years for my prediction about Runrig to come to pass. But hopefully Mr Macdonald will get back to a proper job now."},{"url":null,"title":"the-eurovision-final-that-is-making-classical-music-cool","story":"  But this week Eurovision Young Musician \u0026ndash the Eurovision Song Contest\u0027s lesser-known sister contest featuring virtuouso young musicians from across Europe \u0026ndash is coming to Scotland for the first time as part of the Edinburgh International Festival.  The contest, founded in 1982, has grown in the last 25 years into one of the most coveted classical titles for young talent. Semi-finals have been held this weekend for 18 of the most talented musicians from countries across Europe including Coatia, Greece, Sweden, Spain and the UK, which is represented by BBC Young Musician of 2018, cellist Maxim Calver.  Almost all the other competitors have won equivalent competitions in their home countries. Each has to play their instrument either solo or with piano accompaniment, for a maximum duration of 18 minutes.  The top six will go through to live televised final at Edinburgh\u0027s Usher Hall on Thursday, which as well as being broadcast on BBC will be shown in multiple European countries, giving what organisers claims is an unprecedented platform.  But there is no possibility of politically motivated nul points scores here. The competition jury is made up of the leading names in classical music including Scottish composer and conductor James MacMillan and performer and composer Anna Meredith, and these experts, rather than the public, will choose a winner.  While the song contest is celebrated for its bad taste, this version is perfectly pitched and aims not only to showcase young talent but put the cool back in classical. Promo videos show hip young musicians practising in dressed-down mode in skateparks and urban open spaces.  Maxim Calver, from Norfolk, who is 18 and studies at the Yehudi Menuhin School in Surrey, said he hoped the competition would help inspire other young people to give classical and other forms of music a try.  We are all very early in our careers so it\u0027s a great opportunity, he added. \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s great because we get to meet other people who are similar to ourselves but from different countries and we can be inspired by each other and learn from each other.  He admitted that classical music could be a \u0026ldquodifferent world to some young people but claimed that people should try to see past genre-defining boundaries. UK audience data from 2017 shows that while 41 per cent of classical concert audiences are over 41, only 7 per cent are 30 or under.  \u0026ldquoI love classical, he said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s something I found I really enjoyed playing. But I\u0027m very open to other forms of music too. There is this perception that classical music is very old school and middle class. As performers I think we have to do all we can to move away from that stereotype. I think it\u0027s getting a bit better. Ten years ago it was starting to die among young people. Now I think it\u0027s having a bit of a resurgence.  Edinburgh International Festival head of music Andrew Moore said the competition offered a unique chance to see the classical stars of the future. Previous winners including such eminent figures as Lithuanian-born violinist and conductor Julian Rachlin, British cellist Natalie Clein, Dutch violinist Isabelle van Keulen and German pianist and violinist Julia Fischer.  Moore, who is also on the final judging panel, added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s an important event because it\u0027s a chance to see the 18 most exciting young musicians in Europe. The standard is incredibly high. Its past winners are a stellar list of the most important people in classical music today and it offers a window to future talent.  \u0026ldquoWe hope that as well as offering a platform for the young people taking part it will really inspire other young people. Classical music audiences are older but at the Edinburgh festival we are trying to do a lot to try to encourage younger people to come to concerts and participate.  Jon Ola, the European Broadcasting Union\u0027s (EBU) executive supervisor, who also oversees the Eurovision Song Contest, he was \u0026ldquovery happy to be in Edinburgh for the first time. It is also the first time the competition has been in the UK since its 1982 launch event, when only six countries were involved.  \u0026ldquoWe have a lot of Eurovision brands, not just the song contest but one for young dancers and another for choirs, he added. \u0026ldquoIt has a lot to offer.  \u0026ldquoThe main reason for this project is to provide a showcase for talented, professional young musicians and to give them a large stage to perform on. We aim to show what public service broadcasters can do then they come together.  He claimed that no other TV outlet was able to offer the same level of exposure. In total EBU members operate nearly 2,000 television and radio channels alongside numerous online platforms, and claim to reach audiences of more than one billion people globally, broadcasting in more than 160 languages."},{"url":null,"title":"the-last-dance-thousands-say-farewell-to-runrig","story":"  Runrig \u0026ndash that most Scottish of folk rock bands \u0026ndash performed their last-ever show against the backdrop of Stirling Castle last night. The event, which was titled The Last Dance, took place over Friday and Saturday, and original frontman Donnie Munro took to the stage for the occasion.  Around 52,000 fans flocked to Stirling over the two days, each with their own reasons to say farewell. The tickets had sold out only minutes after going on sale, with fans complaining that they had been snapped up by ticket resellers, for five times the original price.  Runrig, which are known for their Gaelic-language songs as much as the anthems that are sung as a climax to so many special occasions, were formed in 1973 on the Isle of Skye. Their roots have acted as an inspiration for some of their most popular songs, and it\u0026rsquos no surprise that they have a large fanbase hailing from their Hebridean heartland (that word, incidentally, being used as the name of one of their albums, in 1985).  Demand was so great that Scottish airline Loganair put on extra flights from the Western Isles to Edinburgh and Glasgow.  The band, which started by playing wedding receptions, are most widely known for their first single Loch Lomond. The instantly recognisable track spent five weeks in the charts in 1983, and it is still a go-to tune to end parties and weddings. But it is their wider body of work \u0026ndash 14 studio albums in total \u0026ndash that their fans were celebrating last night.  Katherine Street, who attended Friday\u0026rsquos show at Falleninch farm in Stirling, said: \u0026ldquoIt was absolutely fantastic. They played non-stop for over three hours. It was a superb venue with the backdrop of Stirling Castle. It was very well organised, very memorable, and I think the Runrig members were very moved by it.  The appearance of Munro was also a massive selling point. He left the band in 1997 to pursue a career in politics and went on to become a solo performer, but he was back, just like the old times and to the delight of the faithful.  \u0026ldquoDonnie also did a couple of numbers with the Glasgow Island Choir. It\u0026rsquos probably the best one I\u0026rsquove been to, and I\u0026rsquom not a huge Runrig fan, but that was a great night with a great crowd, said Street.  The six-strong band have undoubtedly made a large contribution to Scottish music and culture. The Canadian vocalist Bruce Guthro, who has toured with the band for 20 years, said: \u0026ldquoAll of it has been special. It\u0026rsquos almost impossible to pick certain highlights \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos just been a great journey.  This morning, many will be sad to see the band go their separate ways, but The Last Dance was a fitting send-off, and something that will be remembered for years to come.

Rozlyn Little goes in search of these intrepid entrepreneurs to discover their motivation, the difficulties they have faced \u0026hellip and the successes they have celebrated.  Mati Ventrillon  Fair Isle Knitwear  Halfway between Shetland and Orkney, exposed to the worst that the North Atlantic can throw at it, lies Fair Isle. At only three miles long, this rugged island is an unlikely location for a business \u0026ndash but Mati Ventrillon has made it her mission to restore the original Fair Isle style of knitwear.  It all started when her husband spotted an old National Trust for Scotland property to buy on the island. The couple instantly recognised the opportunity, believing it would be the perfect place to raise future children.  They put their names forward, but were rejected: \u0026ldquoWe loved the island when we came to visit, and we decided to keep in contact with the National Trust and we asked if any property was made available in the future, would they consider us? And they did.  Within a year, they had moved to Fair isle, in another NTS property that had come up for sale.  Mati is trained as an architect, but couldn\u0026rsquot find work on the island. She\u0026rsquod done some knitting in the past and, though she admits she was far from passionate about it, she was drawn to the geometric patterns of the island\u0026rsquos famous knitwear and began working with the Fair Isle Crafts Co-operative in 2007.  The company specialised in creating Fair Isle pieces and continuing the craft, traditionally designed to provide clothing for the island\u0026rsquos men when they were away on whaling ships.  She fell in love with it, and when the company was dissolved in 2011, she decided to continue its legacy by herself. \u0026ldquoIt started as a bespoke business. The fact that I did it online was a big change for the island, because people here would just take pre-orders over the cruise ship that comes here.  The business had been a significant success, attracting orders from the UK and around the world. She has even locked horns with legendary fashion house Chanel according to reports in 2015, Mati\u0026rsquos shop was visited by two Chanel staff members who bought her garments saying it was for \u0026ldquoresearch. The encounter led to accusations that Mati\u0026rsquos designs had been plagiarised, and the fashion giant was eventually forced to issue a formal apology.  However, it\u0026rsquos not all plain sailing for a business operating on such a remote island. Mati faces many challenges \u0026ndash not least the weather \u0026ndash but she has learned to \u0026ldquoaccept it and move on, especially when it comes to poor internet signal.  \u0026ldquoIt means you can\u0026rsquot really upload things or send high-resolution photos. Everything is high-definition now, so when I\u0026rsquom working with the graphic designers and photographers we have to find alternative ways. They will send me USB flash drives in the post. I can see the images that way. Then I send a list of selections and coordinate it like that. It can be quite funny. But this can delay things.  The population of Fair Isle was approximately 400 people in 1900, but now stands at just 54 \u0026ndash including the couple\u0026rsquos two children.  Mati knows more must be done to boost the island\u0026rsquos population \u0026ndash and islanders have put in place a development plan to bring at least five new young families to the island. As well as employing a local director, she recently hired an ex-intern who is originally from France: \u0026ldquoBringing young people is very important, she says. \u0026ldquoWhen I moved here, the population was about 70 something, and it has decreased significantly in the last 10 years.  She believes that the fact she is producing her knitwear, which is handcrafted using 100% Shetland wool, on the island has helped her boost the success of her business \u0026ndash as well as giving them an understanding of the heritage that lies behind it.  \u0026ldquoThis is the place where the tradition originated, so the knitting appeared here and is known because of the island. That is a massive advantage in terms of promotion of the business.  She added: \u0026ldquoWe are in the place where the knitwear originated. It\u0026rsquos gave us an understanding of the history and the heritage. It\u0026rsquos given us an understanding of the lifestyle. I think that\u0026rsquos really important in terms of the focus of our business, and how we want to grow.  I have to cut our interview short as a cruise ship is approaching, with 150 people on board. She tells me that these customers do a lot in boosting the local economy. So, what is the main goal of Fair Isle Knitwear?  \u0026ldquoI think that the end game of the business is to grow enough that it can function without me and provide for future generations.  Michael and Katie Morrison  Isle of Barra Distillers  The company was established by husband and wife team Michael and Katie Morrison. It produces high-end gin with seaweed botanicals native to the Isle of Barra and celebrated its first birthday on August 14.  \u0026ldquoMy wife and I were looking into starting the business for quite a wee while. The motivation and the inspiration behind it was to give something back to the island. We\u0026rsquore both from Barra, so the idea of creating a business that hadn\u0026rsquot been done before was also another goal.  Despite its youth, it is already sold across the UK, and in Denmark and Germany. The German distribution deal was signed just last week, and the couple hope to expand into five or six more countries by the end of next year. Recently, the company has been made a finalist in the Best New Business for the Highlands \u0026amp Islands Food \u0026amp Drink Awards.  The gin is part of the couple\u0026rsquos ultimate dream to open a whisky distillery on the island \u0026ndash hopefully within five years. If successful, it will be Scotland\u0026rsquos most westerly distillery.  At 16 years old, Michael Morrison left Barra for Glasgow. He stayed there for 10 years and launched his first business at 20, Barmor, which produced bespoke wooden gift packaging for the whisky industry. The couple put a stop to the business when they both realised the potential of producing their own gin. However, they didn\u0026rsquot forget about their ties to the whisky industry:  \u0026ldquoThe whisky distillery has and always will be our main goal in terms of a product/brand. It was an easy descion to make and I knew that a Single Malt whisky distillery would without a doubt work and be a success on the Island. The Gin was always a piece in the jigsaw to take us to the distillery but I also knew that doing that would help create a unique brand along the way.  However, perhaps the greatest achievement of the company has been the opportunity that it has offered to the residents of Barra.  \u0026ldquoOn the island, employment is quite hard to come by. This offered a different route to employment. It\u0026rsquos the same sort of jobs on the island, so by creating this we hoped it would offer something different that would give people a different perspective.  The couple\u0026rsquos business venture has already created four local jobs, but they don\u0026rsquot plan to stop there. \u0026ldquoIf we keep going the way were going, we hope to take on a couple of people every year, and then five years down the line we want to have a posting of 20-25 people. That\u0026rsquos a big work force for an island this kind of size.  The locals of Barra were right behind Michael and Katie on their endeavour.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had great support from the island itself. When we launched last August in the local community hall, it went really well. The place was full with locals and it was a great night. So, they came out in force and they\u0026rsquore still supporting us to this day.  The team handle marketing and distribution themselves, instead of relying on outsourcing. He admits this is difficult but more rewarding, and it is sometimes a challenge to get the gin to the neighbouring island.  In spite of this, the Isle of Barra distillery continues to flourish, and the Morrisons say they wouldn\u0026rsquot want to start the business anywhere else. A few weeks ago they had their first child, and hope that he will one day continue their legacy:  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not the money that motivates the two of us. It\u0026rsquos trying to create something that hasn\u0026rsquot been done on the island and something that\u0026rsquos going to be left there for years to come. We won\u0026rsquot reap the rewards as much as people that are maybe going to take over after were gone. That\u0026rsquos the whole plan. To build something up that we can leave behind for someone else to carry on.  RISKS OUTWEIGHED BY REWARDS  Stuart MacKinnon, of the Federation of Small businesses, knows the challenges facing new businesses in remote areas \u0026ndash but he also is keen to stress the huge rewards, for local communities as much as the entrepreneurs themselves.  \u0026ldquoIn remote areas there are relatively few large public sector bodies, and over three quarters of private-sector employment is generated by small to medium sized firms. And if there are not a lot of employment options among large businesses and in the public sector but they still want to stay in the area, then they must be more inclined to start on your own.  \u0026ldquoIf you want to be within your community but there is not a job that suits your skills, you can set up on your own.  \u0026ldquoWe have research that shows that business start-ups or registered business start-ups runs at about half the rate in rural than urban areas, but what\u0026rsquos important to remember is the context of those figures.  \u0026ldquoWe hear from our rural neighbours who often talk fondly about their local community, and in our experience the success of many local towns and villages and rural areas is often tied up with the success of their local businesses.  \u0026ldquoWhat we do tend to find is that businesses will offer each other advice and support. Obviously you do find a degree of that in urban centres as well, but you might find that if more people know each other then they are more likely to give them support when they need it."},{"url":null,"title":"thousands-gather-for-dundee-all-under-one-banner-march","story":"  The city had the highest percentage of Yes voters in the 2014 independence referendum, at 57.4 per cent, and SNP MP\u0026rsquos Chris Law and Stewart Hosie were both in attendance to back the campaign.

In the UK, the figure stands at up to 4.5 million tonnes, the team suggests.  The research paper described food loss and waste (FLW) as \"one of the great scourges of our time\", when 10% of the world\u0027s population is chronically hungry.  The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Edinburgh, who examined how much food is discarded within the European Economic Area (EEA) each year before it reaches the point of sale.  Their findings stated: \"The use of aesthetics for classifying and accepting fresh food for sale and consumption is built into food quality standards and regulations of the European Union.  \"The food distribution sector in Europe and the UK is oligopolistic in nature a small number of supermarket chains control a large market share. The influence of these \u0027multiples\u0027 enables them to impose additional proprietary \u0027quality\u0027 criteria.  \"Produce that doesn\u0027t meet these standards may be lost from the food supply chain, never seeing a supermarket shelf - it may not get past the supplier, or even leave the farm.\"  The team said they found few direct measurements of such losses, but continued: \"We estimate avoidable FLW from on-farm cosmetic grade-outs of up to 4,500 kt yr (4.5 million tonnes per year) in the UK and 51,500 kt yr (51.5 million tonnes per year) in the European Economic Area (EEA).  \"Our estimates suggest over a third of total farm production is lost for aesthetic reasons.\"  The university said the climate change impact of growing the wasted food - some of which may be ploughed back into fields, used in animal feed or otherwise reused - is equivalent to the carbon emissions of almost 400,000 cars.  The scientists suggest that greater awareness among consumers, and a movement towards shopping sustainably, could encourage the sale of more \"ugly\" vegetables.  They also suggest a greater use of misshapen produce, perhaps in chopped or processed goods, or for sale at a discount to charities.  Professor David Reay, of the university\u0027s school of geosciences, said: \"The scale of food that is wasted when it is perfectly safe to eat is shocking at a time when one tenth of the world\u0027s population is perpetually underfed.\"  Stephen Porter, also from the school, added: \"Encouraging people to be less picky about how their fruit and vegetables look could go a long way to cutting waste, reducing the impact of food production on the climate, and easing the food supply chain.\"  The study has been published in the Journal of Cleaner Production."},{"url":null,"title":"brewdog told to pay sacked worker 12k","story":"        A former employee of Ellon-based brewers, BrewDog, has won his employment tribunal case after being sacked because he was losing his eyesight!                The company, renowned for brewing oddly-named beers, are based just outside the town in a purpose-built brewery which also serves at its headquarters.

And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

It won\u0026rsquot affect me, but it will affect Thurso, she wrote.As some have underlined, however, such objections amount to very little unless they are submitted directly to the planning department website.On Friday, the council spokesman stressed that all comments filed as both documents and as website comments will be taken into considerationWhitbread, which owns Premier Inn, has applied for permission to build a three-storey, 81-bedroom hotel with restaurant and bar, associated car parking, pedestrian access and landscaping.If approved, the hotel would be built at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Sunday 19 Aug 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117107.jpg","title":"Does the restored Iron Wellie in Wick have healing powers","story":"\u0026nbspTHE famed Grotto of Massabielle in Lourdes brings in thousands of \"pilgrims\" seeking miracle cures with its alleged healing waters \u0026ndash but could a natural spring on the north side of Wick Bay become a similar beacon for the sick and ailing? Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Sunday 19 Aug 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Sunday 19 Aug 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

This will also improve the availability of recycled material for use in the production of bottles and cans in future.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to provide their views on how this scheme can meet Scotland’s needs and help us tackle our throwaway culture.”Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Scotland’s planned deposit return scheme is a landmark in the nation’s circular economy journey, with the potential to drive inward investment and create jobs in Scotland at the same time as improving recycling and reducing litter.\u0026#8221Consultation available to view.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Sunday 19 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Even non-dog owners have praised our initiative.\"She added: \"This is a disappointing thing to happen in our village where so many volunteers do their best to maintain the area to ensure this is a clean and safe place for residents and visitors and I am appalled that this vandalism was apparently carried out by a local resident.\"The community council and Men\u0026rsquos Shed group were put in touch via link man Roddie McPherson, who lives near the fishing village\u0026rsquos landmark harbour.The eco-friendly wooden dispensers can be found at the Avoch end of the railway line path, on Shore Walk by the industrial units, at the harbour green and at the start of the Shaltie Burn path.The move follows a recent initiative in the village to highlight the many paths which can be enjoyed by visitors to the village via a panel erected at a prominent spot near the Lazy Corner.A police spokesman said: \"Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting NE5003/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.\"Sunday 19 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The 3.6km section between Glendoe and Loch Tarff has been particularly challenging and would not have been possible without funding support from SSE, Highland Council and the Scottish Government and European Union totalling \u0026pound250,000, as well as the full support from Glendoe Estate over whose land the trail has been constructed. The opening of this section opens up the South Loch Ness Trail to more walkers, mountain bikers and horse riders and, particularly on this section of the trail, to those of limited mobility.\"Mr Ambrose added that the creation of the LochNess360\u0026deg trail will bring new opportunities for businesses, communities and deliver major economic benefit to the area in the long term.\"It will achieve this because it will attract visitors who may spend up to six to seven days completing the full circuit,\" he added. We know from feedback that there is already substantial interest from key European markets, particularly Germany, and VILN hope by spring 2019 to confidently go out to markets and promote it. As part of the promotion we plan to launch a major new three day running/walking/cycling event in 2020.\"Sunday 19 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this. The guys just said they were acting on instructions.\"Hamish Mackenzie of Tarbat Community Council wrote to Highland Council chief executive Steve Barron back in June after receiving apologies in January from local authority community services staff for the lack of warning.They said the equipment was removed on health and safety grounds \u0026ndash a reason given in other similar instances across the region.However Mr Mackenzie says follow-up enquiries for details about land ownership and the legalities of the situation have not been responded to months later.\"The first choice is to get Highland Council to continue to maintain the park in accordance with the original agreement. People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid. Let\u0026rsquos hope the community gets a quick turnaround and are able to buy the equipment needed and get it ready for next summer.\"Highland Council was approached for comment but had not responded as we went to press.Sunday 19 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Hopes for a visitor trail around an area that was heavily militarised during WWII are now full steam ahead after the project team behind the Aultbea museum secured almost \u0026pound73,000 from the Scottish Land Fund towards the purchase of a former butcher\u0026rsquos shop it has been renting to house the display.People from 19 countries outside the UK were amongst the 5500-plus visitors dropping in between May and October last year and that number is set to mushroom as the facility is improved and plans for a wider trail developed.The project\u0026rsquos chairman Francis Russell told the Journal: \"To some extent we have become masters of our own destiny. This opens up new avenues of funding. The location on the NC500 is very important.\"We ask people when they come in how they heard about us and some say it was while they were driving by. It puts us on the map. We\u0026rsquoll look at the feasibility and cost of a major refurbishment and possibly an extension. We could do with much more space.\"Fellow project volunteer Elizabeth Miles said the boost \"will allow us to get on to develop it the way we would like\".She said: \"Owning the site will open new possibilities. We will look to create a WWII trail where everywhere gets visited. We\u0026rsquore hoping to really do something with it.\"Research found the NC500, which passes the makeshift museum, brought 29,000 extra visitors in its first year, adding an extra \u0026pound9m to the Highland economy.The \u0026pound72,820 award will contribute towards the purchase of the former butcher\u0026rsquos shop and surrounding land.Honorary president of the RACP George Milne said the aim is to create a multi-site museum for current and future generations to learn about the convoys.He said: \"The overall aim is to establish a unique multi-site museum in Wester Ross. Around Loch Ewe we hope to create a permanent exhibition centre, a WWII Trail with interpretation panels, a memorial garden, and the preservation of selected wartime buildings to honour all who served in the Arctic convoys to and from Russia from 1941-1945.\"\u0026nbspThe 75th anniversary of the last convoy to sail from the area will be marked in 2020, with relatives of servicemen and visitors from around the world expected to come in their droves.Gairloch Heritage Museum, which itself secured backing from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise for a \u0026pound2m project to convert the old anti-aircraft operations room in the centre of the village into a state of the art new facility, welcomed the news.It said: \"Congratulations to our friends at Russian Arctic Convoy Museum on procuring the funds to purchase their exhibition centre. Their volunteers have worked really hard to achieve this. We are delighted to see this investment in their project, which recognises a very important aspect of the heritage of our area.\"Sunday 19 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife. Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Sunday 19 Aug 2018 1:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Sunday 19 Aug 2018 1:40 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday.

Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"wait is over as texts arrive with exam results ","story":"\nThose who chose to receive the news by text or email will have woken up to their results this morning while for those awaiting the traditional method will have to wait for an envelope falling through the letterbox.\nShetland pupils have performed strongly, though in some areas the number of passes were down on last year.\nPass rates for National 4 were 94 per cent, down from 96 per cent in 2017.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"various apprenticeships ","story":" Radar Technician – SERCO – Unst\nApprenticeship vacancies are open to male and female applicants, candidates over age 25 will be considered for some vacancies.\nWages vary dependent on employer.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nSunday 19 Aug 2018 1:40 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

A car park, for example, would be a major benefit, although that would of course be a question for the current community council to consider.\"\nAlso there to view the proposals was local Highland councillor Muriel Cockburn, who heard that the new works would have capacity to produce up to 200,000 litres of drinking water per day, supplied by an \"abundant source of raw water from the River Spey\".\n\"It all looks like a major improvement,\" she said, as she surveyed the old treatment works \u0026ndash mere yards from the disused compound where A9 mega pylon workers had been based until a few years ago.\nConcerns have long been raised over that particular eyesore but hopes are high now that a new tenant will be moving in soon to make use of the building.\nFull details of that particular development are still awaited.\nBut if the Scottish Water team win through on schedule, their new treatment works would be installed between the two old buildings.\n\"Obviously we will have to go on using the old treatment works while we construct the new system,\" explained project manager Debbie Henderson. \"But once in place the village will have a new works to look at.\n\"It will actually include two new buildings, which will be prefabricated and delivered to the site from Ross-shire Engineering\u0027s factory in Muir of Ord.\"\nGeorge Phimister, the company\u0027s senior project manager, explained: \"The main treatment process involved passing the raw water through a series of membranes which filter out larger organic compounds while allowing clean water molecules to pass through very fine pores.\n\"The water that has passed through the membranes is then treated further to ensure that it meets customers\u0027 expectations and remains safe to drink all the way to the tap.\"\nThe system will involve new piping from bore holes to a storage tank to the north of the village.\nMr Steel explained: \"Having gathered local feedback we will consider the comments will later advise customers when we are submitting our planning application.\n\"Subject to being granted approval, we anticipate being on site in early 2019, with work continuing into 2020.\"\nSunday 19 Aug 2018 1:40 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116892.jpg","title":"Dual stretch of A9 is back in operation","story":"\u0026nbsp\nTHE dual carriageway on the new A9 stretch between Dalraddy and Aviemore has been re-opened to motorists after roadworks.\nThe timing of the works at the start of the summer was criticised by community and business leaders.\nThere were also claims that Transport Scotland had put off installing the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) cabling last year to allow them to open the dual \u0026ndash part of the \u0026pound3 billion flagship project \u0026ndash as pledged by the end of last summer.\nSeveral laybys still remain closed along the five mile stretch.\nThe road was reduced to single lanes in each direction with 50mph speed limits in place for most of the duration of the six weeks of the work.\nTourism leaders questioned why work could not have been done outwith the peak holiday season.\nSunday 19 Aug 2018 1:40 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117090.jpg","title":"Leader echoes call for special case funding","story":"Iain Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nTHE Scottish Government is \"short-changing\" the Highlands, according to Scottish Liberal Democrats\u0027 leader Willie Rennie.\nHe has echoed local politicians and organisations who argue that Highland is a \"special case\" because of its vast geography.\nHe has told us that he agrees with council chiefs that the region merits a larger share of grant distributed by Holyrood.\n\"The special nature of services in this part of the country isn\u0027t recognised by the Scottish Government,\" Mr Rennie said. \"Highland is short-changed on the NHS and the way the Scottish Government tried to short-change it through council tax changes in 2016 was outrageous.\"\nA proposal was mooted, but later scrapped, for inflicting higher council tax band payers with an extra levy \u0026ndash \u0026pound5 million in Highland \u0026ndash to fund education attainment.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

Heart Foundation Northern Ireland (BHF NI).\n  \nMairead Agnew was inspired by her young neighbour Mark Lynn, who has complex congenital heart disease. At just 8 years old, he has undergone four open heart surgeries and numerous cardiac procedures. \n  \nIn 2015 Mark was diagnosed with heart failure but this still hasn’t stopped him and his parents Donna and Geoff supporting BHF NI and raising almost \u0026pound3,000 for the charity.\n  \nMairead explained: “My sister was born with congenital heart disease so this is a cause that has always been extremely close to mine and my family’s hearts. When I saw the wonderful fundraising that Mark and his family had raised, I wanted to do something to help. When I told Mark I was taking on the Berlin Marathon, he was sure he wanted us to support BHF NI once again.”\n  \nKaren McCammon, Health Services Engagement Lead for BHF NI explained: “When the BHF was founded in 1961, 8 out of every 10 babies born with congenital heart disease died before their first birthday. Our research has helped to turn this around, and now 8 out of 10 babies survive to adulthood. Breakthroughs such as these are only possible because of the support we receive from supporters like Mairead, Mark and his family. We are therefore extremely grateful for all their efforts.”\n  \nBHF have also developed pioneering surgical techniques to treat complex congenital defects. However, there is still much more work to be done. For children like Mark, who have complex congenital heart disease, treatment can be much more difficult.\n  \nMairead, Mark and his family are keen to raise as much awareness and funds as possible and are asking everyone to support in any way they can. You can donate to Mairead or Mark in person or call into any of the following businesses in Ballymena: The Moat Bar, Kockeden Lodge, Credit Union, Willy Allen’s Butchers, The Mace, Ballykeel Chemist, Molly Malone’s Chip Shop and A Star Valeting and Detailing, Ballymena who are running a special offer between August 16 and September 16 - offering full valets for just \u0026pound60 and \u0026pound70 for jeeps and 4x4\u0027s, \u0026pound2 of every full valet will be donated to the cause.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921264.jpg--.jpg?1534230306000\n","title":"plans to extend public realm scheme to greenvale street","story":"  \nPLANS are being considered to extend the Public Realm Scheme to Greenvale Street in Ballymena Town Centre.\n  \nHowever, one local business owner who has been based on the street for 20 years, has hit out at the lack of consultation around the proposals.\n  \nClaire Brennan of Oasis Hair Salon claims she has had to rely on “hearsay” in a bid to find out more about the plans.\n  \nNIE is currently carrying out utility works on the street which is expected to last four weeks.\n  \nClaire said: “I have heard that after the four weeks they are planning to rip the entire street up and replace it as part of the Public Realm Scheme. I understand that the work is expected to last right up until Christmas.\n  \n“My issue is firstly there has been no consultation, I don\u0027t know exactly what they are planning to do. \n  \n“We are relying on hearsay at the minute and I have heard that there are plans to lay stone similar to the rest of the town.” \n  \nClaire said she had written a letter to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council about the issue.\n  \nShe continued: “It took ten days to get a reply which said there was “nothing concrete at the minute”.\n  \nClaire said that among her concerns was that the area has a very slopping street which raises issues around what type of paving is used.\n  \nShe added: “Also there are concerns around water flowing down the street due to the slope and the fact that if the paving used is light in colour chewing gum, which will eventually cover it, will turn black and soon make the street look grubby and shabby.”\n  \nClaire said she would like to see either the street remain the same and be “brought back to its former glory” or be consulted on any proposed plans.\n  \n“We want to have a debate about it, not have to rely on hearsay.

Alan rounds off with some insights into the general history of dam-building in this country and relates how civil engineering has developed its own code of ethics over the 200 years since the foundation of the Institution of Civil Engineers.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921285.jpg--.jpg?1534232428000\n","title":"estelle in the frame for spectacle wearer of year win","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman has been chosen from thousands of proud glasses wearers as a finalist for Specsavers’ Spectacle Wearer of the Year.\n  \nEstelle Wallace, shortlisted in the 45 – 59 age category from Rasharkin could follow in the footsteps of last year’s Award winner, Love Island hunk Alex Miller, winning \u0026pound10,000 and the chance to mingle with the stars at the annual awards. \n  \nGlasses wearers across the UK and Republic of Ireland have been showing off their specs style by sharing their selfies online.\n  \nEstelle, who is a health and wellness coach, was invited to visit her local Specsavers store in Fairhill Shopping Centre to receive a bottle of champagne, a certificate and a \u0026pound125 glasses voucher.\n  \nEstelle said: “I was really delighted to be shortlisted as a regional finalist.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

Their actions made history but Dungannon’s pivotal role in the quest for social justice was soon forgotten as images of beaten and bloodied marchers on the Duke Street march that October grabbed headlines around the world.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDungannon-born presenter Lynette Fay with Bernadette McAliskey during recording for Stories in Sound: In The Footsteps, due to be broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster this Sunday (August 19) at 12.30pm\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBorn in Dungannon only a decade later, presenter Lynette Fay had no idea that people she knew growing up – her brother’s primary school teacher, and her next door neighbours – were among the organisers of that first march.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn this Stories In Sound documentary for BBC Radio Ulster, she follows ‘In The Footsteps’ of those first civil rights marchers. She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost. Fifty years on from that first civil rights march, how has Dungannon – and Northern Ireland – changed?\n\nIn the Footsteps - presented by Lynette Fay and produced by Freya McClements – is broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster on Sunday, August 19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602191.1534343875!/image/image.jpg","title":"fundraising in memory of elizabeth","story":"\nElizabeth Adams was an employee of Mountvale Private Nursing Home, Dromore for over 11 years, she was a work colleague but mainly a friend.  \n\n                \nAfter a short illness called Sarcoidosis, she passed away peacefully on January 15.

Since its formation in 1994, the initiative has sent over 2000 students from Northern Ireland to all four corners of the United States where they have successfully completed a year studying\n\nJonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland, added: “I am confident that the students departing for the US this year will be great ambassadors for Northern Ireland and will help to further important long-term links and connections. A recent report published by the British Council has highlighted that the relationship between the US and the UK is driven as much by cultural factors, as political with programmes such as Study USA supporting these links and strengthening them for the future. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Through Study USA, students will have the opportunity to not only enhance their employability skills but also develop intercultural skills, which will help them to prepare to work in a global economy. We wish them success, and trust that new connections and friendships will be developed in the year ahead.”\n\nStudy USA is just one of many international opportunities available through British Council Northern Ireland.

As the years went on they became less and less involved, but they were still on our board of directors for a number of years.\n“As time went on we became more secular and we didn’t have that relationship with the Church anymore. But we’re still very grateful for them for setting it up and for identifying the huge need for counselling and support in this area, I suppose because Ardoyne was hit so hard by the conflict.\n“The Passionists worked tirelessly, and I remember sister Kathleen constantly bringing funders into a room and saying ‘You have got to fund this.’ Because there was very little funding in the early days she worked extremely hard to get us established, funded and working.\n“We have grown considerably, and we now deliver about 12,000 to 13,000 sessions a year to about 2,500 people. As well as operating from this site, we also work in a range of local schools and community venues. If someone wants to be seen or needs help somewhere else we can do that too.”\nNorma continued: “Our clinical practice is excellent. We have just been awarded BACP [British Association for Counselling and Psycho-therapy) accreditation for our services. Most counsellors are individually accredited by the BACP, but very few organisations carry the accreditation. We are one of only six in Northern Ireland to be accredited this year.”\nWith a degree in psychology and a professional background in both therapy and conflict resolution, Norma said that New Life felt like a place where she could make a difference.\nIn the past, she has worked at New Life as a sessional counsellor and her experience in play therapy has allowed her to help children and adults alike. New Life is one of the few organisations in the north that offers child and family therapy – services that Norma insists are vital for North Belfast.\n“I think in this area you are working with generations of people who have had things really difficult,” she said.\n“Personal safety was at risk throughout the Troubles and the area has grown up with generations and generations of high unemployment. Poverty, conflict and trauma have a huge impact, not just psychologically, but on a cellular level it impacts people physically.\n“Poverty also has a huge impact on children’s education and a number of different things, so we’re working with multiple issues for a lot of families and they are trying really hard to overcome those things. It has a massive impact on people’s self-esteem, so it’s almost a vicious cycle.”\nShe continued: “There is a lot of research that has come out recently into adverse experience in childhood and the impact that those have on physical health, mental health, and educational achievement. The aim is to try to tackle things early. I think that’s why we believe that child therapy is so important, because you’ve got to be working with children from an early age to begin to address their issues early on.\n“If you don’t catch certain things in childhood, sometimes you’re working with very difficult teenage years because it’s harder to intervene. Sometimes those teenagers will come back as adults and they will feel like they are ready to tackle the issue at that stage.\n“At any stage in life it’s encouraging to know that anything can be repaired. Our brains are wonderful organs and in many ways they have a great plasticity so you can address those issues, you just have to be motivated and have the right motivator to identify what that change might look like.\n“Not everybody needs counselling, sometimes a friend or a colleague or anyone you can connect with can transform things for you. Talking to anybody helps you and can help you, but counselling gives a framework and a focus for those who need it.\n“If you can catch people before they hit the crisis it’s much better. When you’re in a crisis your ability to think clearly, to support yourself or to act lessens, so it’s much harder to activate the changes you need. If you can get into counselling when you’re not in crisis then you’ll be able to change things more quickly, but counselling can really help. It helps you to clear your mind enough to realise what needs to happen next to take you out of crisis.”\nWhile New Life has come on leaps and bounds since it began, offering thousands of yearly counselling sessions, Norma admits that mental health charities, including New Life, need more support to effectively help those in need of support.\n“I think pre-Troubles we didn’t have nearly enough mental health services,” she said.\n“People were just in lockdown mode, they were just surviving. Since the peace process there has been a lot more services established. I think mental health services are still desperately underfunded in Northern Ireland given what we have come through.\n“For our service we have a six-month waiting list and sometimes it can go up to a year. If you need a counsellor it’s way too long to wait, but we don’t have the funding to deliver any more sessions than we currently do.\n“I think there needs to be more accessible services. People get fed up sitting on a waiting list and a lot can happen in that space of time.”\nShe concluded: “If you do need someone to talk to it’s important that you come forward. Young people, especially can access our services quite quickly so we would really encourage them to come forward.”\nIf you think you might benefit from talking to New Life, call 90 391630.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tribute call for elisha scott","story":"\n\nTHE\n public vote to name the new road leading to the Olympia Leisure Centre in Belfast is in its final week and SDLP Councillor Donal Lyons is encouraging people to ensure they have their say and to vote for \u0026#8216Elisha Scott Boulevard\u0026#8217.\n\nElisha Scott is a Liverpool football legend and was Belfast Celtic’s most successful manager who also took the club on their tour of the US in 1949 where they defeated the then British champions, Scotland.\n\nCllr Donal Lyons said: “The vote to name this new road closes on this Sunday and the 125th anniversary of Elisha Scott’s birth will be on the 24th of this month, just days after. \n\n“I’m glad that my proposal to name this road after Elisha Scott has been included because despite Elisha being one of the most successful footballers to have come from our city, awareness of his achievements has faded. \n\n“It’s my hope, that by naming this road after Elisha Scott that we can correct this and begin to give him the full and long overdue recognition he deserves.”\n\nGoalkeeper Scott was born just yards from this new road. Cllr Lyons said it It would be fitting if the road was named after one of Belfast’s greatest ever footballers.\n\n“After famously signing for Liverpool FC in 1912 for ‘£1 and the price of the boat trip’, Scott would be a key player in Anfield for an incredible 22 years, making 468 first-team appearances. He holds the record as Liverpool’s longest serving player to this day. The earliest recorded football chant was Liverpool fans cheering his name. Scott is widely considered the first King of the Kop. \n\n“But it’s not just his time in Liverpool that’s worthy of celebrating. Elisha returned to the Donegall Road in 1934 to become player-manager for Belfast Celtic. Over the following 14 years, he would secure 31 trophies with the Grand Old Team, including 10 Irish League titles, six Irish Cups and eight Gold Cups. Belfast Celtic were the powerhouse in local football and the club still retains a loyal and dedicated fan base. \n\n“Scott also knew what mattered in football and when challenged amid worsening sectarian tensions in the 1930s, for fielding a cross community team he responded in his trademark forthright style, ‘I don’t play Protestant players. I don’t play Catholic players. I play good players.’ Scott’s success as both player and manager secured his place in history but his dedication to his club, players and fans ensured his place as a legend of the game.”\n\nYou can vote online at https://dof.belfastcity.gov.uk/NameTheRoadVote/  or by emailing NameTheRoad@BelfastCity.gov.uk with Elisha Scott in the subject and including your name and address.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"75m rooftop running track plan for old belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belleek firm marks papal visit with special souvenirs","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself.

For items less than £100, you may be able to use your debit or credit card provider\u0027s Chargeback scheme,\" he said.\n\nThe comments came as it was revealed House of Fraser owed more than £484m to creditors including top designer brands Armani, Diesel, Prada and Gucci. \n\nAnd Sports Direct chief Mike Ashley, who bought out House of Fraser, will not be footing the bill for any money owed before his £90m rescue last Friday.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"i have done nothing to justify any resignation says paisley","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"service to mark anniversary of ballygawley bus bombing","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They had been en route to their Omagh base after returning from leave.\n\nAs they passed through the townland of Curr in the early hours of August 20, the Provisional IRA detonated a 200lb bomb which had been planted in a nearby vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\u0027It\u0027s getting harder to live with as time goes by. I have flashbacks\u0027\n\n\n\n\n \n\u0027It was like watching a horror film slowly unfold\u0027\n\n\n\n\n \n\u0027Why did they lose their lives in such a way? It\u0027s inhuman\u0027\n \n\n\n\nThe force of the explosion hurled the bus 30 metres down the road, threw soldiers into neighbouring fields and left a six-foot crater behind it, scattering wreckage at least 100 yards.\n\nShortly afterwards the Provisionals claimed responsibility, saying its Tyrone \u0027brigade\u0027 carried out the attack and adding: \"We will not lay down our arms until the peace of a British disengagement from Ireland.\"\n\nMany families and individuals connected with the soldiers\u0027 regiment will return to Omagh this weekend to remember those murdered.\n\nThe services and events, which come days after this week\u0027s commemorations for the 1998 Omagh bomb, have been planned by South East Fermanagh Foundation (SEFF), a local victims\u0027 support organisation which has worked collaboratively with Ballygawley residents over the years.\n\nSEFF has supported the return of the families to the scene where their lives forever changed to mark the 30th anniversary - both those who lost their lives and those who were and remain affected by the attack.\n\nAt 10am, survivors and relatives of the soldiers who lost their lives will attend a ceremony held at the site, where there will be an opportunity for wreaths and poppy crosses bearing messages to be laid.\n\nA replacement memorial and panels explaining what occurred on the Co Tyrone road in 1988 will also be dedicated during the hour-long service, organised by SEFF.\n\nThis will be followed by a morning prayer service in Newtownsaville Church of Ireland at 11.30am. This will include a special act of remembrance in respect of those murdered on August 20, 1988, prayers for their families and for the surviving injured.\n\nKenny Donaldson, director of services at SEFF, said the events are designed to bring together all those affected by the atrocity.\n\n\"Over the weekend leading up to the 30th anniversary we have arranged a variety of events for everyone impacted by the bus bombing, he said.\n\n\"This includes the medical physicians, local police and military response, fire service or ambulance personnel, locals living on the Ballygawley Road, the band buses which were following the soldiers\u0027 bus and who came to the scene and heroically offered what assistance they could and others who came upon the scene.\"\n\nThe 52-seater unmarked Ulsterbus coach had been transporting 36 soldiers of the 1st battalion of the Army\u0027s Light Infantry Regiment from Belfast International Airport back to Lisanelly Barracks in Omagh. Eight soldiers from England, aged from 18 to 21, were killed, all but one dying instantly, with another 18 wounded.\n\nThe security forces suspected that an informer may have told the IRA of the bus route and the time it would be at a specific spot. Following the attack, the military started ferrying troops to and from East Tyrone by helicopter to stop future attacks.\n\nThere was evidence, given the fact the explosive used was Semtex, that the Libyan government had supplied the material. Ten days later, three members of Tyrone IRA suspected of having carried out the bombing were killed by the SAS.\n\nThe Omagh Protestant Boys Flute Band and the Londonderry marching band Star of the Valley, who came across the scene on their way home from an event in Portadown, stopped their buses.\n\nA number of bandsmen and women helped the wounded and dying soldiers and were soon joined by local people, as well as the emergency services.\n\nThe dead were Jason Burfitt (19), Richard Greener (21), Mark Morsworthy (18), Stephen Wilkinson (18), Jason Winter (19), Blair Bishop (19), Alexander Lewis (18) and Peter Bullock (21).\n\nAll had been returning to Tyrone to complete six months of a two-year tour.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein stage 50th anniversary civil rights march from dungannon","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Ask Jean McConvilles family?\"\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, Mr McCrossan said Sinn Fein\u0027s actions at the time were \"the complete opposite\" of the civil rights movement. \n\n\n‘We shall Over Come’?! Are you serious Sinn Fein? \nThose powerful words belong to those brave peacemakers \u0026 people who marched for Civil Rights, stood against violence, hate, sectarianism - PEACEFULLY! \n\nThe complete opposite of what SF were involved in at the time! \nhttps://t.co/e4CXcL3sJV\n\n— Daniel McCrossan MLA 🕊 (@McCrossanMLA) \nAugust 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nReacting to the comments, a Sinn Fein spokesperson said: \"Daniel McCrossan would have been welcome to attend today’s march to stand up for rights and equality for all citizens. \n\n“Unfortunately, he would rather spend his time constantly attacking Sinn Fein and trying to score cheap political points, as usual.\"\n\nThose gathered at the event heard from former Sinn Fein chairperson Mitchel McLaughlin and MP Francie Molloy. \n\n\n\n\nPro-life coalition joining civil rights march re-enactment \u0027to stop Sinn Fein hijack of history\u0027\n\n\n\n\nAddressing the crowd, Mr McLaughlin said the civil rights movement was \"never a republican conspiracy\" but was an \"an instinctive and largely spontaneous response to decades of unionist misrule, abuse and sectarianism\".\n\nHe added there were ongoing rights issues still being contested in Northern Ireland, many of which are tied to the ongoing Brexit process.\n\nEarlier this year Sinn Fein\u0027s national chairperson Declan Kearney was criticised after saying the civil rights movements was influenced by IRA and Sinn Fein leadership at the time. \n\nCivil rights campaigner and former MP Bernadette McAliskey, known as Bernadette Devlin at the time, said his comments had no basis in fact. \n\nFormer People Before Profile MLA and civil rights campaigner Eamonn McCann said Sinn Fein were attempting to \"colonise history\". \n\nSaturday\u0027s march was also attended by a large contingent of pro-life activists, who were protesting Sinn Fein\u0027s stance on abortion. \n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37228478.ece/18b8f/AUTOCROP/w620h342/windsor_prefight017.jpg","title":"windsor park transformed for 25000 ahead of","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We’ll have people here right up until hours before the Mass begins.\n\n“It will look very, very different in a week’s time when Pope Francis stands here on the altar and looks out at a sea of 500,000 people.”\n\nSinger and composer Fr Liam Lawton will have the honour of performing an originally composed psalm along with a choir of 3,000 people for Pope Francis.\n\n“I’ve been very privileged to have been asked to write the psalm of the day,” Fr Lawton said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeating being installed at the site in Phoenix Park (Laura Hutton/PA)\n\n\n\n\nThe psalm is called The Lord Hears The Cry Of The Poor.\n\n“It is basically very much in keeping with the theology of the Pope himself,” he said.\n\nOn a visit to the site on Friday, Fr Bryan Shortall said he was very excited about the event.\n\nAs a young boy he was one of the thousands who turned up to see Pope John Paul II in 1979.\n\n“It was absolutely amazing,” Fr Shortall said.\n\n“I kind of think that maybe that was the day – as my vocation percolated, I think that was the day that I felt that maybe I’d become a priest.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"temporary morgues planned for popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards.

The influence of these ‘multiples’ enables them to impose additional proprietary ‘quality’ criteria.\n\n“Produce that doesn’t meet these standards may be lost from the food supply chain, never seeing a supermarket shelf – it may not get past the supplier, or even leave the farm.”\n\nThe team said they found few direct measurements of such losses, but continued: “We estimate avoidable FLW from on-farm cosmetic grade-outs of up to 4,500 kt yr (4.5 million tonnes per year) in the UK and 51,500 kt yr (51.5 million tonnes per year) in the European Economic Area (EEA).\n\n“Our estimates suggest over a third of total farm production is lost for aesthetic reasons.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers lamented the amount of food that fails to reach supermarket shelves (Kirsty O’Connor/PA)\n\n\n\n\nThe university said the climate change impact of growing the wasted food – some of which may be ploughed back into fields, used in animal feed or otherwise reused – is equivalent to the carbon emissions of almost 400,000 cars.\n\nThe scientists suggest that greater awareness among consumers, and a movement towards shopping sustainably, could encourage the sale of more “ugly” vegetables.\n\nThey also suggest a greater use of misshapen produce, perhaps in chopped or processed goods, or for sale at a discount to charities.\n\nProfessor David Reay, of the university’s school of geosciences, said: “The scale of food that is wasted when it is perfectly safe to eat is shocking at a time when one tenth of the world’s population is perpetually underfed.”\n\nStephen Porter, also from the school, added: “Encouraging people to be less picky about how their fruit and vegetables look could go a long way to cutting waste, reducing the impact of food production on the climate, and easing the food supply chain.”\n\nThe study has been published in the Journal of Cleaner Production.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"can you guess which job is being represented by these basic stock images","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Most cameras have sensors that can go up to 3,200 or even 6,400 ISO [International Organisation for Standards]. The footage I captured was shot at 256,000 ISO.”\n\nThe annual Perseid meteor shower is caused by debris falling from the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle and burning up when it comes into contact with the Earth’s atmosphere. \n\nThe meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.\n\nBrandon said: “This year’s shower was better than usual because the peak was next to a new moon allowing for darker skies.”\n\nIn 2018, the Perseid meteor shower is visible from July 17 to August 24.\n\nBrandon gave advice to budding photographers looking to capture the celestial event next year, saying: “I’d start with long exposures of the night sky. There are lots of tutorials on YouTube on how to start.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"whats the purpose of the hajj pilgrimage","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The hajj is seen as a chance to wipe clean past sins and start fresh. Many seek to deepen their faith on the hajj.\n\nDespite the physical challenges of the hajj, many people rely on canes or crutches and insist on walking the routes. Those who cannot afford the hajj are sometimes financed by charities or community leaders. Others save their entire lives to make the journey. A few even walk thousands of miles by foot to Saudi Arabia, taking months to arrive.\n\n\nWhat is the history of the hajj?\n\n\nWhile following a route the Prophet Mohammed once walked, the rites of hajj are believed to ultimately trace the footsteps of the prophets Ibrahim and Ismail – or Abraham and Ishmael as they are named in the Bible.\n\nMuslims believe Ibrahim’s faith was tested when God commanded him to sacrifice his only son Ismail. Ibrahim was prepared to submit to the command, but then God stayed his hand, sparing his son. In the Christian and Jewish version of the story, Abraham is ordered to kill his other son, Isaac.\n\nPilgrims also trace the path of Ibrahim’s wife, Hagar, who Muslims believe ran between two hills seven times searching for water for her dying son. Tradition holds that God then brought forth a spring that runs to this day. That spring, known as the sacred well of Zamzam, is believed to possess healing powers, and pilgrims often return from the hajj with bottles of its water as gifts.\n\n\nWhy is the Kaaba so important to Muslims?\n\n\nIslamic tradition holds that the Kaaba was built by Ibrahim and Ismail as a house of monotheistic worship thousands of years ago. Over the years, the Kaaba was reconstructed and attracted different kinds of pilgrims, including early Christians who once lived in the Arabian Peninsula. In pre-Islamic times, the Kaaba was used to house pagan idols worshipped by local tribes.\n\nMuslims do not worship the Kaaba, but it is Islam’s most sacred site because it represents the metaphorical house of God and the oneness of God in Islam. Observant Muslims around the world face towards the Kaaba during their five daily prayers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA pilgrim drinks water near the Grand Mosque (Dar Yasin/AP)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the rituals performed during the hajj?\n\n\nPilgrims enter into a state of spiritual purity known as “ihram” that is aimed at shedding symbols of materialism, giving up worldly pleasures and focusing on the inner self over outward appearance.\n\nWomen forgo makeup and perfume and wear loose-fitting clothing and a head covering, while men dress in seamless, white terrycloth garments. The white garments are forbidden to contain any stitching — a restriction meant to emphasise the equality of all Muslims and prevent wealthier pilgrims from differentiating themselves with more elaborate garments.\n\nMuslims are forbidden from engaging in sexual intercourse, cutting their hair or trimming nails while in ihram. It is also forbidden for pilgrims to argue, fight or lose their tempers during the hajj. Inevitably, though, the massive crowds and physical exhaustion of the journey test pilgrims’ patience and tolerance.\n\n\nThe first day of hajj\n\n\nThe hajj traditionally begins in Mecca, with a smaller “umrah” pilgrimage which can be performed year-round. To perform the umrah, Muslims circle the Kaaba counter-clockwise seven times while reciting supplications to God, then walk between the two hills travelled by Hagar. Mecca’s Grand Mosque, the world’s largest, encompasses the Kaaba and the two hills.\n\nBefore heading to Mecca, many pilgrims visit the city of Medina, where the Prophet Mohammed is buried and where he built his first mosque.\n\n\nThe second day of hajj\n\n\nAfter spending the night in the massive valley of Mina, the pilgrims head to Mount Arafat, some 12 miles east of Mecca, for the pinnacle of the pilgrimage.\n\nThey scale a hill called Jabal al-Rahma, or Mountain of Mercy. It is here where Mohammed delivered his final sermon, calling for equality and for Muslim unity. He reminded his followers of women’s rights and that every Muslim life and property is sacred.\n\nAround sunset, pilgrims head to an area called Muzdalifa, 5.5 miles west of Arafat. Many walk, while others use buses. They spend the night there and pick up pebbles along the way that will be used in a symbolic stoning of the devil back in Mina, where Muslims believe the devil tried to talk Ibrahim out of submitting to God’s will.\n\n\nThe final three days of hajj\n\n\nThe last three days of the hajj are marked by three events: a final circling of the Kaaba, casting stones in Mina and removing the ihram. Men often shave their heads at the end in a sign of renewal.\n\nThe final days of hajj coincide with Eid al-Adha, or the festival of sacrifice, celebrated by Muslims around the world to commemorate Ibrahim’s test of faith. During the three-day Eid, Muslims slaughter livestock and distribute the meat to the poor.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"which greek island is to be run exclusively on wind and solar power","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

the Mediterranean to run exclusively on wind and solar power.\n\nhttps://www.belfasttelegraph/news/world-news/which-greek-island-is-to-be-run-exclusively-on-wind-and-solar-power-37229849.html\n\nhttps://www.belfasttelegraph/news/world-news/article37229845.ece/b0384/AUTOCROP/h342/bpanews_9ca19a31-256e-4b5f-9cf8-ed1b81c4fcec_1\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the blades of its 800-kilowatt wind turbine start turning, the small Greek island of Tilos will become the first in the Mediterranean to run exclusively on wind and solar power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nThe sea horse-shaped Greek island between Rhodes and Kos has a winter population of 400.\n\nBut that swells to as many as 3,000 people in the summer, putting an impossible strain on its dilapidated power supply.\n\nThis summer, technicians are conducting the final tests on a renewable replacement system that will be fully rolled out later this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA solar park on the Aegean island of Tilos (Iliana Mier/AP)\n\n\n\n\nIt will allow Tilos to run exclusively on high-tech batteries recharged by a wind turbine and a solar park.\n\nThe European Commission says Tilos will be the first autonomous renewable green island in the Mediterranean.\n\nIt plans to use the project as a blueprint for other small islands across the European Union that have limited grid connection to the mainland.\n\nThe EU has largely funded the project, providing 11 million euro of the total 13.7 million-euro cost.\n\n“The innovation of this programme and its funding lies in the batteries, the energy storage, that’s what’s innovative,” project manager Spyros Aliferis said.\n\n“The energy produced by the wind turbines and the photovoltaics will be stored in batteries, so that this energy can be used for the grid when there is demand.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople eat in a tavern in the Aegean island of Tilos, Greece (Iliana Mier/AP)\n\n\n\n\nThe batteries store power during sunny and windy conditions, releasing it during periods of heavy demand and lower production, such as at nighttime and the peak tourist season, to keep the grid powered up.\n\nNamed Tilos, Technology Innovation for the Local Scale Optimum Integration of Battery Energy Storage, the project uses a prototype battery system that improves storage of the excess energy generated until it is needed.\n\nTo work, it required an overhauled grid with smart meters installed in homes and businesses to calculate times of peak demand.\n\nCurrently, Tilos gets its energy from an underwater cable that runs from Kos to the island of Nisiros and on to Tilos.\n\nThat creates an erratic, outage-prone service that routinely breaks appliances and has forced many businesses to rely on diesel generators.\n\n\n\nFor many years now, Tilos has plotted a course that is dedicated to protecting the environment\nMaria Kammas, mayor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile lacking the dazzle of other Greek islands like Mykonos and Santorini, Tilos, a 14-hour ferry ride from the mainland, is a quiet vacation spot that sees an average of 13,000 visitors a year.\n\nIt is known as a green island, popular with hikers and bird watchers, and most of it is now a protected nature reserve.\n\nMayor Maria Kammas saw a green energy system as the island’s natural next step.\n\n“For many years now, Tilos has plotted a course that is dedicated to protecting the environment,” she said.\n\n“We are seeking visitors, tourists actually, people who will visit our island who love the environment and want to protect it and nature as it was given to us.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoats stand in front of electric pylons that have been serving Tilos (Iliana Mier/AP)\n\n\n\n\nTourism is the main source of revenue for the island.\n\nBut businesses have been plagued by lengthy blackouts, leaving hotels without air conditioning and restaurants without light or power, forcing them to discard food from warm refrigerators.\n\nWith long sunny days and average temperatures of 33C (91F) during the summer, tourists spend their mornings at the beach and afternoons napping.\n\nThe island comes alive in the evening, when businesses open and residents and tourists alike flock to bars and cafes.\n\nEva Lemaire has visited the island every year for more than two decades.\n\nComing from the Netherlands, which has one of the world’s highest environmental standards, she says Tilos’ green policies stand out in Greece.\n\n“I’m also a little bit proud of Tilos about what they are doing now, with the renewable energy,” she said.\n\n“I think it’s good for the island not to be dependent on other islands.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds local witches gather guildhall launch derrys week long halloween celebrations","story":"\nDerry’s ancient Walls became a sea of pointy hats this evening as a coven of hundreds of witches came together to launch the programme for this year’s world famous Halloween celebration in the city.\n\nThe 2018 event will run from 26th October – 3rd November 2018, with over 100 family friendly activities at more than 40 venues, stretching over eight jam-packed days.\n\nThe theme for this year’s Carnival Parade is Return of the Ancients, looking back to the Pagan origins of Hallowe’en which reach far back to the times of Cúchulainn and Fionn MacCool and beyond.\n\nLaunching the event, the Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor John Boyle, said the gathering of witches perfectly conjured up some of the magical atmosphere which has made Derry Halloween renowned across the world.\n\n“I was delighted to see so many people donning their pointy hats and hopping on their broomsticks to join in the launch this evening. It really captures the true spirit of the event which has always belonged to the people of this city who go to such great lengths to put on a show every year.\n\n“This year we also celebrate 400 years of the City’s magnificent Walls which play such a key part in our celebrations and we can look forward to another spellbinding celebration and an extended festival with plenty for everyone, young and old, to enjoy.\n\n“Be warned, accommodation always gets booked up fast, so anyone travelling should plan their trip now.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027243184\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\nAmong the regular highlights which draw thousands to the city each year, is the Awakening of the Walls, which makes a welcome return for 2018.\nAs we celebrate four centuries since the building of the city’s stunning ramparts, watch as they come alive with an illuminated animation trail on and around the City Walls from October 28-30.\n\nThe Guildhall will once again be at the centre of the celebrations with the magical Museum of the Moon bathing the Main Hall in its ethereal light for seven days, and where the Samhain Sessions will showcase some fantastic musical talent under its ghostly glow.\n\nUp to 1000 people will be taking part in the carnival parade which is always the main highlight of the programme and a mass community celebration for all. Following the spectacular carnival celebrations and fireworks finale on October 31st, just when you thought it was all over, on November 1st the Walls will once again become the setting for First Light, which will bring the community together for a special celebration of light, remembrance and renewal.\n\nAdd to this story-telling, ghost tours, the Jack-O-Lantern Festival, the Monster Funfair, Little Horrors, Shape Shifter costume and make up workshops and the haunted Harvest Market, and you have the secret formula for the best Halloween celebration in the world.\n\nLooking ahead to the event, Festivals and Events officer with Council, Liz Cunningham, said: “Tonight’s gathering of witches gives just a hint of what’s to come, and really shows how much the people of the city have made this celebration their own. We are thrilled that so many wicked witches turned up for some fun this evening. This year we’ve extended our programme, making it our biggest celebration to date, and we just look forward now to showing the world how it’s done.”\n\nYou can find out more about all the spooktacular celebrations on derryhalloween or follow @DerryHalloween on social media #DerryHalloween\n\nEnds\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new mission centre run franciscan friars replace community hall derry closed","story":"\nA Derry community centre which closed down is now set to be brought back into use after ambitious plans were lodged for its redevelopment.\n\nSt Joseph’s Parish Centre in the Galliagh area is now to be redeveloped as a ‘Mission Centre’ after an application was lodged with Derry City and Strabane District Council for the redevelopment of the building.\n\nThe application, which was lodged by the Franciscan Friars, will see the demolition of part of the building to be replaced by a new build.\n\nThe proposal states that the new development will be used as Friars Mission Centre, ‘providing for running of courses, activities for school groups, youth clubs, together with provision of support for people in need of same’.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027243295\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\nSpeaking to the Derry News yesterday, the SDLP councillor for the area welcomed the progress on the proposal.\n\n“It’s good to see these plans progress, as this building has been closed for some time now, and it will be a positive move for the local community to see it brought back into use,” Cllr Tierney said.\n\n“The new centre will also benefit the young people living in the Galliagh area, and also help to bring new investment in youth services and schemes for young people.”\n\nThe plans will be considered by the local council’s Planning Committee in the autumn.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein derry call meenan square site bosgide cleaned secured soon possible","story":"\nSinn Féin Foyle MLA Karen Mullan has called for the derelict Meenan Square complex which has been the site of much anti-community activity to be cleaned up and secured as soon as possible.\n\nThe site was used to light a controversial bonfire in the city on Wednesday night.\n\nKaren Mullan said: “Councillor Patricia Logue and I are calling for Meenan Square site to be cleaned up and secured as soon as possible.\n\n“We will be meeting with all stakeholders to move the project along, funding is in place for this site and is an Urban Villages Key Project and we request that all efforts are put in place to move this forward.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027243236\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\n“We are also calling on the owner of the site to step up to his responsibility and work closely with the community.\n\n“The well-publicized issues with this site have have been ongoing now for a number of years, the local community cannot go through another of summer this.
