The, I guess, liaison with the royal family never answers back, and there\u0027s no address I can write to, so I have no way of contacting my daughter,\u0027 the ex-Hollywood lighting director said.\u0027My message (to her) would be, I love you, I miss you, I\u0027m sorry for anything that went wrong.

Perhaps she did not want to.\u0027I felt I needed stay with her and that she needed me. I asked her if she wanted me to stay and she said \u0027yes\u0027.\u0027I am glad I did - even if it was only to offer her a little support.\u0027The fact that she did not hand the phone to anyone else showed to me that she needed it.\u0027Ms Russell advised the \u0027very scared\u0027 12-year-old to go to the room least affected by smoke, shut the windows, stay low and cover her mouth.She went on: \u0027After about an hour I could not get anymore response from her - only rasping sounds, then nothing.\u0027I stayed on the line a little while longer with my hand hovered over the call termination button.          Heartache: Jessica\u0027s family, pictured, handed out posters of her in the days after the fire as they initially believed she was missing\u0027I was torn as what best to do. I eventually ended the call when the line fell silent.\u0027Reflecting on that call, I felt completely helpless.\u0027When people are pleading with you, saying do not want to die and I cannot physically do anything to help them it is very hard.\u0027I can pass on all the information but I cannot actually do anything - that is very tough.\u0027The information that Jessica had fled to a higher floor was not passed on to fire crews on the ground, who searched her flat but found no trace of the youngster. Ms Russell revealed that, not long after the call ended, she became aware that the advice to callers had been changed from \u0027stay-put\u0027 to attempt to evacuate.She said she did not recall ringing previous callers back with the changed advice, just answering the \u0027relentless\u0027 calls and updating new callers.

I remember someone saying, \u0027I wish they\u0027d call again\u0027                        There was a lull in the calls at around 5am, Ms Russell said, recalling the words of a fellow operator.She said: \u0027It went eerily quiet and a little creepy. I remember someone saying, \u0027I wish they\u0027d call again\u0027.\u0027That way we would have known that they were still alive.\u0027Jessica was one of 72 people who died following the blaze on June 14 last year.Her remains were found on the 23rd floor of the 24-storey block, an inquest heard last year. She was identified by dental records and the preliminary cause of death was given as \u0027consistent with the effects of fire\u0027.The 12-year-old became one of the best-known faces of the disaster after relatives plastered missing posters bearing her photograph around North Kensington in the days after the fire. Initially it was not known whether or not Jessica was still alive, due to confusion about the fact she wasn\u0027t in her flat on the 20th floor.  Family and friends, many wearing T-shirts saying \u0027Happy birthday Jessie\u0027, released balloons to mark what would have been her 13th birthday on 4 July.  Call operators managed to save 60 Grenfell residents  More than 60 residents trapped in Grenfell Tower were saved as a result of 999 call information passed from the control room to fire crews, an assistant manager said.Alexandra Norman spent a \u0027traumatic\u0027 shift in the London Fire Brigade\u0027s control room, where she said operators abandoned normal policy in order to take as many calls as possible.The assistant operations manager said she was told that more than 60 people were rescued due to crucial information passed to the command unit on the ground.She only found this out after the fire, describing the lack of updates from the scene as \u0027frustrating\u0027.The control room received 344 emergency calls relating to Grenfell Tower, the public inquiry into the disaster previously heard.    Inferno: An inquiry is currently underway after the Grenfell Tower fire caused devastation last yearBetween 1.20am and 2am the volume of calls became \u0027overwhelming\u0027 and \u0027all hell broke loose\u0027, Ms Norman said in a written statement to the inquiry.She said: \u0027I was still thinking to myself \u0027What the hell is going on\u0027 and the information was coming through so quickly that we were unable to process it.\u0027I had never known a fire to spread so quickly. There was no information from the crews on the ground.\u0027She added: \u0027Control room officers normally stay on the phone for FSG (fire survival guidance) calls but my staff just couldn\u0027t stay on the phone for that long, so we had to be efficient in giving advice, then move onto the next call as we had people waiting.\u0027We couldn\u0027t follow the policy in these circumstances and there is no amount of training that would have prepared anybody for that.\u0027At just after 2.45am, she was told by a senior manager that advice had changed and callers should now be told to get out of the building.She wrote this on a piece of paper which she showed to phone operators who were busy taking calls.\u0027My feeling about this decision was that it should have been made sooner,\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/19/00/4E616E9000000578-5966725-image-a-73_1531957856044.jpg","title":"Californias iconic Highway 1 near Big Sur ready reopen","story":"    The newly built, two-lane stretch of road in Big Sur, California opened on Wednesday - two days ahead of schedule The transportation department posted a photogram on Twitter on Wednesday that showed the new road and said it\u0027s now \u0027OPEN for business\u0027.Construction workers made good progress and officials decided to reopen it ahead of a ribbon-cutting ceremony scheduled for Friday. Big Sur, with miles of rugged coast, cliffs and wilderness about 150 miles south of San Francisco, features spectacular views of the ocean and accommodations at high-end resorts. The slide along the highway linking Northern and Southern California has stymied visitors and hurt businesses, including Ragged Point Inn and Resort, which saw business cut in half.The scenic stretch of Highway 1 in the popular tourist area reopened (left) to traffic more than a year after it was blocked off by a massive landslide (right)    The stretch of scenic highway was buried in up to 40 feet of stone and dirt after the mammoth landslide in May last year (pictured above)          Construction workers made good progress and officials decided to reopen it ahead of a ribbon-cutting ceremony scheduled for Friday          Josh Collins, of Associated Traffic Safety, removes a Road Closed sign from the roadway as Highway 1 is reopened\u0027We are beside ourselves,\u0027 resort spokesman Rori Cosma said about the highway reopening. \u0027We\u0027re extremely happy and desperate to hire people.\u0027Cosma said the parking lot was packed Wednesday with drivers circling for a spot.

The singer was having lunch at his Algarve retreat in August 2014 when the police raided his luxury apartmentThe ramifications of that dramatic raid on August 14, 2014, are still being felt today. But the sorry saga started two months earlier when BBC reporter Dan Johnson received a tip-off from a confidential source.It was at the height of Operation Yewtree, the extraordinary Metropolitan Police investigation into a string of celebrities following the Jimmy Savile scandal.A junior but ambitious reporter, Mr Johnson said his tipster had revealed there was ‘one more high profile person being investigated’. The reference was oblique, but the journalist guessed correctly it was Sir Cliff. And when the source told Mr Johnson, whose BBC patch is the north of England, that the investigation was ‘closer to home’, he also worked out it involved South Yorkshire Police.Although Mr Johnson never named his source, the court ruled yesterday it was most probably either a police officer from the Yewtree inquiry or someone associated with the police.The reporter was on the trail of what his boss called a ‘bloody cracking’ scoop – but he was described by the judge as ‘capable of letting his enthusiasm for his story get the better of his complete regard for truth’.‘BLACKMAILING’ THE POLICEOn July 9, armed with his sensational tip, Mr Johnson spoke on the phone to South Yorkshire Police’s head of communications, Carrie Goodwin. When he casually asked whether Sir Cliff was ‘on their radar’, she gave ‘an audible gasp’, he told the court.          Police officers search the property of pop star Sir Cliff Richards in Sunningdale, Berkshire in August 2014. Sir Cliff watched the breaking news Miss Goodwin, who had been privately briefed about the highly sensitive investigation by police chiefs, remarked that he had good sources, claimed Mr Johnson.Miss Goodwin told Matthew Fenwick, the detective superintendent leading the investigation, and chief constable David Crompton. The police say they decided to co-operate with the BBC to avoid the story being broadcast and tipping off their suspect before they were ready to swoop on his home.They invited Mr Johnson in for a meeting. At 1pm on July 15, he met Miss Goodwin and Mr Fenwick – and their discussion is hotly contested.The reporter claimed police voluntarily gave him information about their investigation, confirming it involved a 13-year-old boy allegedly sexually assaulted in a dressing room after a Billy Graham event in Sheffield in the 1980s.But the force said Mr Johnson already knew these details and used them to ‘blackmail’ police into giving the BBC advance notice of their raid on Sir Cliff’s apartment.Either way, a deal was struck. Miss Goodwin said the police would give Mr Johnson the date and location of the search if he agreed not to broadcast the information in advance.EXCITEMENT AT THE BBCJubilant that his ‘tactics’ had worked, Mr Johnson told his BBC editor Declan Wilson, who passed it on to his own boss, Gary Smith, with an email entitled: ‘Sit down when you read this.’In reply, Mr Smith quoted from Sir Cliff’s 1968 Eurovision Song Contest entry by saying: ‘Congratulations. And jubilations. I want the world to know I’m happy as can be.’ Mr Wilson claimed police had even considered arresting tennis fan Sir Cliff at Wimbledon, adding: ‘Off record, they want the publicity as they believe there are others.’          A very emotional looking Sir Cliff Richard seen leaving the High Court after winning his battle with the BBC. The judge said: ‘Excitement was being created in the BBC over the prospect of the story.’ When Mr Johnson was asked by his boss how he had managed to persuade the police, he said he had got detectives ‘over a barrel because of the tip-off I had received’.On the evening of August 13, police stuck to their deal and gave the journalist the details he needed. They even emailed him an aerial photo of the apartment block.The BBC machine swung into action. Camera teams were dispatched to the apartment in Berkshire, police HQ in Sheffield, Sir Cliff’s home in the Algarve and his other home in Barbados. And that helicopter was fired up.Mr Smith, the BBC’s UK news editor, wrote in a gleeful email: ‘The money shots will be police going in and out of his flat and loading bags of hard drives or whatever into their vans. We can only get this from the helicopter.’BBC BEAT POLICE TO THE DOOROn the morning of August 14, Operation Kaddie was launched – and hapless police found the BBC were already there.Mr Johnson and two other reporters and their crews had set up camera angles well before 9am, ready to cover the drama live. As the helicopter hovered overhead, a police press officer updated Mr Johnson with text messages.Woman \u0027saw a black Mercedes like the one owned by Borce...Share this articleIn five cars, eight police officers entered the gated estate at 9.35am. They spoke to a building manager who phoned Sir Cliff in Portugal to tell him police had arrived with a warrant to search his home. Sir Cliff later told how, as a decent, law-abiding citizen, all he thought was that he must help the police and instructed the manager to ‘Please let them in’.Police entered the apartment at 10.40am, and three minutes later Mr Johnson was informed by text.From the camera in the helicopter, officers were filmed going through the singer’s possessions. And on the ground, an officer read a prepared statement to a BBC crew. By now, Sir Cliff’s lawyers had been alerted too and were racing to the scene.A ‘HUDDLE’ IN THE NEWSROOMIn the BBC newsroom at 12.15pm, managers held a ‘huddle’ to discuss their scoop and whether to name Sir Cliff, even though police had not. The go-ahead was given by deputy director of news Fran Unsworth, who considered it ‘strongly’ in the public interest.At 1pm the BBC unveiled its ‘top story this lunchtime’ along with dramatic footage of the police raid.          News helicopter images of police arriving to search the Berkshire property belonging to Sir Cliff Richard in relation to an alleged historical sex offence. The ‘vile’ allegations hung over him for almost two years until the police dropped the case without any charges The broadcast went live to Mr Johnson outside the property, and he continued his breathless reports on the BBC News Channel all afternoon. In total there were 44 BBC TV broadcasts that afternoon, with Sir Cliff’s strenuous denials added to the reports from 2pm.A BBC editor, Richard Clark, sent Mr Johnson a congratulatory email saying: ‘Good work, Dan. Well done.’ The reporter replied it was ‘old-fashioned journalism’.But by the evening, an explosive row was brewing.THE FALLOUTOn Radio 4’s Six O’Clock News, respected home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw suggested the BBC’s tip-off had been an ‘attempt by the police to ensure maximum coverage’ of the raid.South Yorkshire Police responded angrily, saying they had not tipped off Mr Johnson, who had ‘blackmailed’ them. Press chief Miss Goodwin complained to him: ‘This wasn’t the case and brings the force into disrepute.’She wrote to her chief constable: ‘It’s wildly inaccurate. The Met leaked it and we asked the BBC not to run it.’ As police prepared an explosive press release claiming the BBC had been fed the tip by Operation Yewtree, Mr Johnson, knowing his tip-off had come from someone outside South Yorkshire Police, begged his superiors to put out a correction to the Danny Shaw report.

My view has not changed.\u0027Wray spoke after a day of controversy in Washington over whether Trump accepts the intelligence agencies\u0027 assessment and whether he believes Moscow is continuing to try to influence American elections or threaten the nation\u0027s infrastructure.Wray also dismissed Putin\u0027s offer to allow the U.S. access to 12 Russian military intelligence officers who have been indicted on charges of interfering in the election in return for being able to interview Americans the Kremlin has accused of unspecified crimes.The White House said it was under consideration. Wray dismissed the offer.\u0027I never want to say never about anything,\u0027 Wray said, \u0027but it\u0027s certainly not high on our list of investigative techniques.\u0027Much of the conversation with Wray focused on Russia.\u0027Russia continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day,\u0027 Wray said.He said that while U.S. officials have not yet seen an effort by Russia to target specific election systems, it is aggressively engaged in influence operations to sow discord and isiveness in America. \u0027To me, it\u0027s a threat that we need to take very serious and respond to with fierce determination,\u0027 Wray said.

The girl went to Memorial Park in Herne Bay thinking this was where her friend was, but was unable to find her.          An inquest ruled that Ms Peebles died as a result of an accident          A toxicology report found Ms Peebles, 16, was twice the legal drink drive limit when she diedMs Peebles\u0027s boyfriend Adam Wilson, now 17, spoke through tears as he explained his final day with her.It was heard the two had an argument during the evening and each went off with their own group of friends on the train.Mr Wilson explained that after realising she was not with the group once they got off, he repeatedly tried calling his girlfriend but failed to reach her.          An inquest ruled that Ms Peebles\u0027s death was accidentalHe said: \u0027She wouldn\u0027t answer at all. That\u0027s when I really started to worry. I went back to my friend\u0027s house. I couldn\u0027t sleep so I left in the morning.\u0027I walked past the station and there were lots of ambulances outside.\u0027I was worried, so I went to her house and looked in her bedroom window on the ground floor. But she was not there.\u0027Mr Wilson received a call from one of his friends telling him it was his girlfriend\u0027s body that had been found near the railway station.Along with another of her friends, Mr Wilson went back to Ms Peebles\u0027 house and broke the news to her mother, Hayley Peebles.A friend Hannah Brooker said Ms Peebles had been emotional during the evening and at one point told her she \u0027felt like she had no one\u0027.Ms Brooker reassured her this was not true and said she put her mood down to alcohol and others noted she had seemed \u0027jolly\u0027.Her mother was adamant Ms Peebles would not have taken her own life.\u0027That would never even cross my mind,\u0027 she said.\u0027She used to get emotional when she got drunk but that\u0027s true of the majority of people.\u0027The post-mortem suggested Ms Peebles had been electrocuted after touching a live rail shortly after she got off the train and would have died instantly.Toxicology tests also found she had a blood alcohol level around twice that of the legal drink drive limit.While she had suffered some burns and other injuries to the head and body, there was nothing to suggest she had been assaulted.Assistant coroner Ian Goldup ruled the death to be accidental.He said: \u0027Her telephone calls to her friends indicate she was lost and unable to help herself.\u0027The coroner stated he will be writing to Network Rail suggesting action be taken to prevent others from dying as Taiyah did.Mrs Peebles said she wants to see railway stations made safer following her daughter\u0027s tragic death          Friends of Ms Peebles have painted a mural in tribute for the tragic teenagerSpeaking in tribute to her daughter, Mrs Peebles said: \u0027She was a law unto herself. She was very bubbly. She loved to be out with her friends. She loved spending time with her sisters and nieces.\u0027She lived every day of her life like it was the last.\u0027While barriers have since been put up at Herne Bay station, Mrs Peebles said this is not enough and she wants stations across the country to be made safer.She continued: \u0027I am just flabbergasted at the amount of deaths which have happened on the railway and nothing is done. \u0027It seems it does not matter how many lives they take nothing is done.\u0027They are just another statistic. I am not going to let Taiyah become just another statistic.\u0027Speaking after the inquest, she said: \u0027I am now on a mission to get all the train stations made safe so no one will have to go through what I have.\u0027We would like to make children and young adults aware of the dangers of railways.

Sir Cliff Richard won a landmark case against the BBC yesterday, but a judge\u0027s suggestions that naming someone under investigation is unlawful have led to fears over freedom of the pressMr Stephens added: \u0027I know Sir Cliff has said he would rather 10 guilty people go free than one ­innocent person suffer but it is in the public interest that 10 guilty people are caught, even if we have to inconvenience one innocent person.\u0027Weinstein pleaded not guilty to rape and sexual assault charges at New York Supreme Court last month.Allegations against him were first made in a New York Times report in 2017.A number of other women who had worked with him in the film industry then went public with their claims and the case prompted discussion about attitudes to sexual misconduct around the world.His is just one of the number of case being cited in arguments against inhibiting media reports about crime suspects.           Yesterday\u0027s legal ruling centred on a report the BBC broadcast from outside Sir Cliff\u0027s mansion as police raided it as part of an investigation into an alleged sexual assaultTV and radio personality Stuart Hall was jailed for indecently assaulting 13 girls aged between nine and 17 after reports of the investigation led to more victims coming forward.Similarly, the identification of Max Clifford led to more victims going to police before the PR guru was jailed for indecent assaults on girls and young women.Campaigners for transparency have also said that more victims of Jimmy Savile may have come forward had his questioning by Surrey Police been made public in 2009.  Fran Unsworth, Head of BBC News, wrote in an email to staff today that it is not in the public interest for suspects to stay secretConcerns over the impact of the Cliff Richard judgment were echoed in an email sent to BBC staff by the corporation\u0027s Head of News today.Fran Unsworth stated: \u0027Although the judge found against us, he was clear that what we broadcast was accurate and as I said outside the courtroom, I believe all our journalists acted in good faith.\u0027There\u0027s a significant principle at stake as well - one that affects all media organisations, not just the BBC.\u0027If this ruling stands, it changes the way in which all journalists will have to approach naming the subject of a criminal investigation.\u0027It effectively would make it unlawful that anyone under investigation can be named, unless the police do so. And I don\u0027t believe that\u0027s in the public interest.\u0027Within hours of the Cliff Richard ruling, the Prime Minister was asked in the Commons whether a \u0027Cliff\u0027s Law\u0027 should be introduced.This would ban the media from naming a person before they are charged, except in exceptional circumstances.Theresa May told MPs that she believed there were cases where naming the accused before they are charged \u0027enables other victims to come forward and therefore strengthens the case against an inidual\u0027.           Sir Cliff with his lawyer Gideon Benaim outside the High Court in London today\u0027He never expected after 60 years in the public eye that his privacy and reputation would be tarnished in this way, and that he would need to fight such a battle.\u0027Although he felt it necessary to pursue this case and the sum awarded in damages is one of the highest ever in this area of law, Sir Cliff\u0027s motivation was not for personal gain, as he knew all along that he would be substantially out of pocket no matter what.\u0027His aim has been to try to right a wrong, and, to ensure as best he could, that no other innocent person would have to endure what he went through.\u0027What Sir Cliff wanted was for the BBC to acknowledge that what it had done to him was unlawful. Before litigation commenced we asked the BBC to accept this and to apologise.\u0027Sir Cliff would have been reasonable in relation to damages had they agreed to do so. Not only did they refuse to apologise but they were defiant, repeatedly telling the world that this was public interest journalism, when it was not. They even submitted the story for an award, which the Judge found to be an aggravating factor.          Speaking  outside court, Sir Cliff said it would take time to get over \u0027the emotional factor\u0027\u0027The Judge came to the clear conclusion that Sir Cliff\u0027s privacy rights were not outweighed by the BBC\u0027s right to freedom of expression, and, that there did not exist a public interest in identifying him.\u0027Given the adverse findings of fact by the Judge, serious questions ought to be asked about the BBC\u0027s focus on preserving their exclusive story at the expense of Sir Cliff\u0027s rights, as well as how the BBC came to advance such a factual case, including to the Home Affairs Select Committee in 2014.\u0027Additionally, whether senior executives exercised sufficient scrutiny over the activities of their journalist, and in approving and signing the BBC\u0027s Defence.\u0027We welcome today\u0027s Judgment, and Sir Cliff would like to wholeheartedly thank everyone who has supported him throughout, his family, friends and of course his fans. It has meant a huge deal to him.

Sir Cliff Richard won a landmark case against the BBC yesterday, but a judge\u0027s suggestions that naming someone under investigation is unlawful have led to fears over freedom of the pressMr Stephens added: \u0027I know Sir Cliff has said he would rather 10 guilty people go free than one ­innocent person suffer but it is in the public interest that 10 guilty people are caught, even if we have to inconvenience one innocent person.\u0027Weinstein pleaded not guilty to rape and sexual assault charges at New York Supreme Court last month.Allegations against him were first made in a New York Times report in 2017.A number of other women who had worked with him in the film industry then went public with their claims and the case prompted discussion about attitudes to sexual misconduct around the world.His is just one of the number of case being cited in arguments against inhibiting media reports about crime suspects.           Yesterday\u0027s legal ruling centred on a report the BBC broadcast from outside Sir Cliff\u0027s mansion as police raided it as part of an investigation into an alleged sexual assaultTV and radio personality Stuart Hall was jailed for indecently assaulting 13 girls aged between nine and 17 after reports of the investigation led to more victims coming forward.Similarly, the identification of Max Clifford led to more victims going to police before the PR guru was jailed for indecent assaults on girls and young women.Campaigners for transparency have also said that more victims of Jimmy Savile may have come forward had his questioning by Surrey Police been made public in 2009.  Fran Unsworth, Head of BBC News, wrote in an email to staff today that it is not in the public interest for suspects to stay secretConcerns over the impact of the Cliff Richard judgment were echoed in an email sent to BBC staff by the corporation\u0027s Head of News today.Fran Unsworth stated: \u0027Although the judge found against us, he was clear that what we broadcast was accurate and as I said outside the courtroom, I believe all our journalists acted in good faith.\u0027There\u0027s a significant principle at stake as well - one that affects all media organisations, not just the BBC.\u0027If this ruling stands, it changes the way in which all journalists will have to approach naming the subject of a criminal investigation.\u0027It effectively would make it unlawful that anyone under investigation can be named, unless the police do so. And I don\u0027t believe that\u0027s in the public interest.\u0027Within hours of the Cliff Richard ruling, the Prime Minister was asked in the Commons whether a \u0027Cliff\u0027s Law\u0027 should be introduced.This would ban the media from naming a person before they are charged, except in exceptional circumstances.Theresa May told MPs that she believed there were cases where naming the accused before they are charged \u0027enables other victims to come forward and therefore strengthens the case against an inidual\u0027.           Sir Cliff with his lawyer Gideon Benaim outside the High Court in London today\u0027He never expected after 60 years in the public eye that his privacy and reputation would be tarnished in this way, and that he would need to fight such a battle.\u0027Although he felt it necessary to pursue this case and the sum awarded in damages is one of the highest ever in this area of law, Sir Cliff\u0027s motivation was not for personal gain, as he knew all along that he would be substantially out of pocket no matter what.\u0027His aim has been to try to right a wrong, and, to ensure as best he could, that no other innocent person would have to endure what he went through.\u0027What Sir Cliff wanted was for the BBC to acknowledge that what it had done to him was unlawful. Before litigation commenced we asked the BBC to accept this and to apologise.\u0027Sir Cliff would have been reasonable in relation to damages had they agreed to do so. Not only did they refuse to apologise but they were defiant, repeatedly telling the world that this was public interest journalism, when it was not. They even submitted the story for an award, which the Judge found to be an aggravating factor.          Speaking  outside court, Sir Cliff said it would take time to get over \u0027the emotional factor\u0027\u0027The Judge came to the clear conclusion that Sir Cliff\u0027s privacy rights were not outweighed by the BBC\u0027s right to freedom of expression, and, that there did not exist a public interest in identifying him.\u0027Given the adverse findings of fact by the Judge, serious questions ought to be asked about the BBC\u0027s focus on preserving their exclusive story at the expense of Sir Cliff\u0027s rights, as well as how the BBC came to advance such a factual case, including to the Home Affairs Select Committee in 2014.\u0027Additionally, whether senior executives exercised sufficient scrutiny over the activities of their journalist, and in approving and signing the BBC\u0027s Defence.\u0027We welcome today\u0027s Judgment, and Sir Cliff would like to wholeheartedly thank everyone who has supported him throughout, his family, friends and of course his fans.

Then they’d take the muzzles off the hyenas and put their heads between their jaws’I first learned about Nigeria’s “hyena men” in 2005, thanks to a picture that had gone viral. The caption said they were debt collectors in Lagos. I knew I had to find them. The country has a population of 186 million people, though, so the odds were pretty low. But then in 2017 a journalist friend told me they come from his home town, Kano, in the north. Two weeks later, I was on my way.The hyena men are itinerants: they never spend more than two days anywhere. I found them in a shanty town near Abuja, the capital. Despite the language barrier we got to know each other pretty quickly. Outside of Lagos and Port Harcourt, I didn’t see a single white person in Nigeria. So I probably seemed as odd to them as a guy walking a hyena in the street seemed to me.We smoked some weed to break the ice. It turned out they weren’t debt collectors – they were more like town criers, traditional storytellers who performed in the streets and sold potions after their shows. It reminded me of stories I’d read about eastern European circus troupes in the 1930s – except instead of bears, these guys had hyenas, baboons and pythons.Seeing them perform was unforgettable. It was a huge spectacle. They would beat drums to draw in the crowds, then take the muzzles off the hyenas. Next they’d put their arms and even their heads between the animals’ jaws. The aim was to convince the audience they had special powers, and that the audience could acquire them too, if they bought their potions.At first I tried photographing the street shows, but there was just too much going on. Then I realised that the relationship between man and beast was more interesting than all the fireworks of the performance. There was something very strange going on between the guys and the hyenas, bordering on sadomasochism. These animals had been taken out of the wild as pups. They couldn’t return. They were entirely dependent on these guys for food. And these men were dependent on the animals for their livelihoods. They needed each other, but it wasn’t an easy symbiosis.I didn’t have too much trouble with the hyenas. If you feed and water them, they’re cool, they’re happy. But the baboons were a lot more problematic. Baboons are just so close to humans. They have much more emotionally complex needs, I think. The guys had scratch marks everywhere from the baboons – they were always getting into fights. I don’t think the baboons were happy. I love how confrontational this shot is. At no point did I tell him how to pose. It’s all him. He flexed his bicep, stared straight at me, while his hyena jumped all over him. Then in the background, there’s this kind of Mad Max landscape strewn with broken-down trucks, though you can hardly see them because of the light. It was harmattan season, a time between November and March when the sands of the Sahara blow over western Africa creating this murky, diffused lighting, which I love. It’s a simple shot with an incredible economy.

The company said the fee was based on the “value created” by Murray and covered his work over the three years to March. Kempster said it was too early to say if Murray would continue to be paid a similar amount as his pay was set each year by the board: “The group has always had a performance-related pay culture and this is very much in the same box.”Toys R Us: 180 stores employing 3,000 staff, collapsed 28 February.

It has warned that profits have been hit by lower than expected sales, with profit margins also down as a result of having to cut prices to match rivals.The independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said: “Anybody who still believes in Mike Ashley’s punting powers will be disappointed to hear that the company has had to write a net £85m off the value of its ‘strategic stake’ in Debenhams.”Kempster said the firm was “very happy with the results” and had delivered underlying profit growth at the upper end of expectations. “In a tough market maintaining sales is OK,” he said. He said Sports Direct’s strategy of investing in the appearance of its stores was paying off, giving it better access to key sports brands’ top products. He added that strategic investments such as Debenhams were “part of our DNA”. The group is in dialogue with the ailing department store about initiatives that might help both retailers, moving on from the set-up of a number of Sports Direct outlets in Debenhams stores.After a review of staff wages in the UK, the company said it was continuing to pay all staff, including casual workers, hourly rates above the national minimum wage, as well as commission and other rewards worth £20m a year. Eligible employees participating in the firm’s share bonus scheme received shares worth £45.5m during the year. It stressed that all staff in the UK receive holiday pay and statutory sick pay.It follows a  investigation in 2015 that found that temporary workers at Sports Direct were effectively receiving hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage because they were required to go through security searches at the end of each shift, for which their time was unpaid, and also suffered deductions from their wage packets for being late.“There aren’t many companies that feel the need to state compliance with the national living wage in their annual results – but then Sports Direct isn’t renowned for diligently following corporate etiquette,” Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.Sports Direct said it would not pay a idend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e1d5a49d538d5d2b7d513e9243c04d50ee80469/0_0_2138_1283/master/2138.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d1ab68341ec3523c6a33d60b2ce3590","title":"cashless society con big finance banks closing atms","story":"Banks are closing ATMs and branches in an attempt to ‘nudge’ users towards digital services – and it’s all for their own benefitAll over the western world banks are shutting down cash machines and branches. They are trying to push you into using their digital payments and digital banking infrastructure. Just like Google wants everyone to access and navigate the broader internet via its privately controlled search portal, so financial institutions want everyone to access and navigate the broader economy through their systems.Another aim is to cut costs in order to boost profits. Branches require staff. Replacing them with standardised self-service apps allows the senior managers of financial institutions to directly control and monitor interactions with customers.Banks, of course, tell us a different story about why they do this. I recently got a letter from my bank telling me that they are shutting down local branches because “customers are turning to digital”, and they are thus “responding to changing customer preferences”. I am one of the customers they are referring to, but I never asked them to shut down the branches.There is a feedback loop going on here. In closing down their branches, or withdrawing their cash machines, they make it harder for me to use those services. I am much more likely to “choose” a digital option if the banks deliberately make it harder for me to\u0026nbspchoose a non-digital option.In behavioural economics this is referred to as “nudging”. If a powerful institution wants to make people choose a certain thing, the best strategy is to make it difficult to choose the alternative.We can illustrate this with the example of self-checkout tills at supermarkets. The underlying agenda is to replace checkout staff with self-service machines to cut costs. But supermarkets have to convince their customers. They thus initially present self-checkout as a\u0026nbspconvenient alternative. When some people then use that alternative, the supermarket can cite that as evidence of a change in customer behaviour, which they\u0026nbspthen use to justify a reduction in checkout employees. This in turn makes it more inconvenient to\u0026nbspuse the checkout staff, which in turn makes customers\u0026nbspmore likely to use the machines. They slowly wean you off staff, and “nudge” you towards self-service.Financial institutions, likewise, are trying to nudge us\u0026nbsptowards a cashless society and digital banking. The true motive is corporate profit. Payments companies such as Visa and Mastercard want to increase the volume\u0026nbspof digital payments services they sell, while banks want to cut costs. The nudge requires two parts. First, they must increase the inconvenience of cash, ATMs and branches. Second, they must vigorously promote the alternative. They seek to make people “learn” that they want digital, and then “choose” it.We can learn from the Marxist philosopher Antonio\u0026nbspGramsci in this regard. His concept of hegemony referred to the way in which powerful parties condition the cultural and economic environment in such a way that their interests begin to be perceived as natural and inevitable by the general public. Nobody was on the streets shouting for digital payment 20 years ago, but increasingly it seems obvious and “natural” that it should take over. That belief does not come from nowhere. It is the direct result of a hegemonic project on\u0026nbspthe part of financial institutions.We can also learn from Louis Althusser’s concept of interpellation. The basic idea is that you can get people to internalise beliefs by addressing them as if they already had those beliefs. Twenty years ago nobody believed that cash was “inconvenient”, but every time I walk into London Underground I see adverts that address me as if I was a person who finds cash inconvenient. The objective is to reverse-engineer a belief within me that it is inconvenient, and that cashlessness is in my interests. But a cashless society is not in your interest. It is in the\u0026nbspinterest of banks and payments companies. Their job\u0026nbspis to make you believe that it is in your interest too, and they are succeeding in doing that.The recent Visa chaos, during which millions of\u0026nbsppeople who have become dependent on digital payment suddenly\u0026nbspfound themselves stranded when the monopolistic payment network crashed, was a temporary setback. Digital systems may be “convenient”, but they often come with central points of failure. Cash, on the other hand, does not crash. It does not rely on external data centres, and is not subject to remote control or remote monitoring. The cash system allows for an unmonitored “off the grid” space. This is also the reason why financial institutions and financial technology companies want to get rid of it. Cash transactions are outside the net that such institutions cast to harvest fees and data.A cashless society brings dangers. People without bank accounts will find themselves further marginalised, disenfranchised from the cash infrastructure that previously supported them. There are also poorly understood psychological implications about cash encouraging self-control while paying by card or a mobile phone can encourage spending. And a cashless society has major surveillance implications.Despite this, we see an alignment between government and financial institutions. The Treasury recently held a public consultation on cash and digital payments in the new economy. It presented itself as attempting to strike a balance, noting that cash was still important. But years of subtle lobbying by the financial industry have clearly paid off. The call for evidence repeatedly notes the negative elements of cash – associating it with crime and tax evasion – but barely mentions the negative\u0026nbspimplications of digital payments.The UK government has chosen to champion the digital financial services industry. This is irresponsible and disingenuous. We need to stop accepting stories about the cashless society and hyper-digital banking being “natural progress”. We\u0026nbspmust recognise every cash machine that is shut down\u0026nbspas another step in financial institutions’ campaign\u0026nbspto nudge you into their digital enclosures.• Brett Scott is a campaigner, former broker and the author of The Heretic’s Guide to Global Finance: Hacking the Future of Money"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b9dd09ae28704f043d1d541b44938c8d0a1c7f0/0_184_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73bec3507fec993abf047609575639d0","title":"sharp rise in pupil exclusions from english state schools","story":"Unions point to funding cuts after exclusions rise by about 1,000 from 2016 to 2017The rate of pupil exclusions from state schools in England saw another sharp increase last year, according to official figures, with teaching unions laying some of the blame for the rise on austerity and funding cuts.The number of children permanently excluded from state primary, secondary and special schools in England increased by about 1,000 between 2016 and 2017, according to the Department for Education (DfE) figures.The total of 7,700 equates to more than 40 permanent exclusions a day during the 2016-17 school year, compared with a little over 35 a day the previous year.Fixed-term or temporary exclusions also increased, by around 40,000 compared with the previous year, up to a total of 382,000 – meaning that nearly one in 20 pupils were given a fixed-period exclusion.Geoff Barton, a former secondary school head and the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said cuts in council services meant schools were having to fall back on the use of exclusions.“We are extremely concerned that this increase in exclusions is a result of the school funding crisis and cuts to local children’s services,” Barton said.“Schools have had to cut back on the inidual support they are able to give students, making it more difficult to provide early intervention and prevent behavioural problems from escalating.“At the same time council support services for vulnerable families have been cut back meaning that schools are having to pick up the pieces. Schools only exclude pupils as a last resort and when all other avenues have been exhausted.”Secondary schools accounted for more than four out of every five permanent or temporary exclusions, according to the figures, with “permanent disruptive behaviour” accounting for the bulk of the increase in both types of exclusions.Among those permanently excluded, there was also a sharp rise in those expelled because of physical assault against another pupil, which rose from 825 cases in 2015-16 to 1,025 in 2016-17.The rise in permanent exclusions for the last three years follows a period of a generally downward trend from 2006-07 until 2012-13, and has been rising again since then, although rates are still lower now than in 2006-07.

Their son Mick has followed them into the farming business and has his own property, and their daughter Emily, a town planner, returned home this year to work on the family farm. “What a year to do it,” Doolan says. “My dad didn’t want me to be a farmer and I think this is why. We were a bit the same with our son, we didn’t want him to be a farmer. But you are what you are.” Last year the Doolans recorded their fourth-lowest average rainfall and it has been followed by even drier conditions. They have sold whatever stock they can and spend their entire days at the moment feeding the cattle that remains because the pastures have dried up.Farmers in this part of NSW are importing almost all food for their livestock from as far away as South Australia as prices rise with demand. The continued cost of buying feed is causing many to question their future on the land. The NSW government recently approved an emergency drought relief package of $600m, at least $250m of which will cover low-interest loans to assist eligible farm businesses to recover. The package has been welcomed but, in the words of a local farmer, “it barely touches the sides”. With the prospect of a dry El Niño weather pattern hitting the state in spring, the longer-term outlook is dire.Jess Taylor and her husband, Robert, are fourth-generation farmers, running a mixed sheep and cattle farm 25km north-west of Coonabarabran. They are raising four children, two not yet in school, while dealing with the stress of nearly two years without substantial rain. Bills from trucking in food for their sheep and cattle are running as high as $20,000 a month. Robert left the property recently to take up shearing work to bring in much-needed cash, leaving Jess to manage the farm and care for their children on her own. “There’s just no income. Whatever the farm is making is going back into feed for whatever we have left,” she says. “It’s hard, it’s hard to know what to do.”The family sold their healthier stock last year before the market “took a huge e”, Jess says. The ewes on the property are abandoning their lambs because the dry pastures and lack of food have reduced their ability to produce enough milk. “We’ve got close to 30 orphan lambs that we’re hand-feeding,” Jess says. “We lost quite a few of them in the cold snap that just came through despite doing the best we could for them.” Charities such as Buy a Bale, where people can purchase hay bales for local farmers, have been some assistance. The Taylors’ oldest son, Harry, asked for rain for his sixth birthday. While much of NSW experienced a wet start to winter, the dark skies over Coonabarabran have yet to deliver relief. The Taylors say they will not be taking up the government’s loan, as they are already struggling with considerable debt.The Jerry family, also fourth-generation farmers, run sheep and cattle on their property Maryborough, 40km north-east of Coonabarabran. At the head of the family is Coral Jerry, 80, who lives on the farm alone after her husband of 55 years died in 2015. She is hand-feeding 40 orphaned lambs four to five times a day while her son Greg, his wife, Tanya, and their son Brett manage the farm. Things have become so desperate the Jerrys are mixing expired baby formula with their imported cotton seed to add nutrition for their struggling animals. “It’s a never-ending story at the moment,” Greg says. “Every week there’s a chance of some sort of rain but when it happens it’s usually one or two mils, which does nothing ... We actually got 19 mils the other day, which was beautiful.” He says it would take 100mm of rain to deliver long-term improvement to a property that currently “looks a bit like the surface of the moon”. “Financially, we’re on our borderline now,” he says. “We destocked as much as possible early on as it got worse and worse. But what we’re left with now is pretty much unsaleable in the condition they’re in.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb42a056fca94a004d5dd53b86fe6a0f6cf9e0b0/432_349_3201_1921/master/3201.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7c4c626d276618e71b818eee279d07c","title":"brad pitt matt damon leonardo dicaprio turned down brokeback mountain gus van sant","story":"Original director Gus Van Sant has revealed that multiple A-listers turned down the chance to star in the gay romanceLeonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Ryan Phillippe were among the actors who turned down roles in Brokeback Mountain, the gay romance that catapulted Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal to stardom. Gus Van Sant, the director who has frequently collaborated with Damon, revealed in an interview with IndieWire that the film – about two two men hired to herd sheep in Wyoming – proved strikingly challenging to cast. “Nobody wanted to do it,” said Van Sant. “I was working on it, and I felt like we needed a really strong cast, like a famous cast. That wasn’t working out. I asked the usual suspects: Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Ryan Phillippe. They all said no.”Ledger eventually played Ennis, an introverted farmhand, opposite Gyllenhaal’s Twist, the more open of the pair, who continue their affair sporadically over 20 years. It was based on a short story by the writer Annie Proulx.Van Sant worked on the film before Ang Lee took over. It won the best director Oscar, one of three Academy awards the film took home in 2006, although it was controversially beaten to best picture by Paul Haggis’s Crash. Both Ledger, who died in 2008, and Gyllenhaal were nominated for best actor, and their work on the film earned them enduring respect and acclaim. The career of neither actor was felt to be remotely impaired by taking on gay roles. Van Sant was speaking to promote Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot, which stars Joaquin Phoenix and is widely perceived to be a return to form, following the disappointing Sea of Trees.

Henderson and Dejan Lovren, a World Cup finalist with Croatia, are likely to miss the Premier League opener against West Ham United on 12 August due to their late returns.Klopp has no issues with the World Cup – although believes it could have a serious impact on Tottenham Hotspur’s start to the new campaign – but the introduction of the Uefa Nations League in place of international friendlies is a concern. The new competition commences on 6 September, with the finals taking place next June, and the Liverpool manager believes the constant demand on international players will have serious consequences.Henderson and Alexander-Arnold both asked to resume pre-season training shortly after their World Cup commitments with England but their requests were rejected by the Liverpool manager.Klopp explained: “It was a hard fight to convince Jordan that he needed a holiday. I knew that would happen. He feels like he needs training every day, a bit like Millie (James Milner). On the phone I said: ‘That’s crazy’. Jordan needs a holiday so that means August 5 he will be back. Dejan played a day later and had a party in Croatia so he will be back on August 6. That would mean five days training after three weeks holiday. I hope we are in a situation where we don’t need to think about using these two against West Ham.“With Trent I have a special agreement. He wanted to be in earlier as well. As he’s very young I said: ‘Okay, have two weeks holiday and then we’ll speak and see’. If you asked Trent he would be good to join us in Evian (where Liverpool have a training camp at the end of July) but I’m not sure I will do that. I want to have them desperately but the season is really long. We have three games before the first international break. Then it will be the Nations League. So it’s getting more important.

Opening the box is a ritualistic moment, one punctuated by moments of violence. “Crayfish are vicious and angry,” says the chef, Will Emberson. “They cling to the edge. They fight one another. And they fight us.” He holds up his gloved hand, as if to display a war wound, before placing a large crayfish on to a platter of shaved ice. “I feel bad about eating them, but then again ... I\u0026nbspdon’t.” When pressed, he shrugs. “They’re considered pests. The signal crayfish have affected the native white-clawed ones.” So we have a grey and red squirrel situation? “In\u0026nbspsome ways, yes. In some ways ... they’re the squirrels\u0026nbspof the river.” He\u0026nbspsmiles, before pretending to\u0026nbsprip off the crayfish’s head.In the UK, crayfish season runs from May to October, depending on the weather. But business is up this year. Instagram has helped with demand – crayfish’s Giger-esque physique is designed for the socials – and the crustaceans have appeared on Netflix’s Ugly Delicious. It\u0026nbspcould be the Nordic effect (crayfish parties are culturally integral to the region). Then there is the World Cup. China, which produces most of the world’s crayfish, sent a cargo train of 100,000 of the crustaceans to Moscow for this year’s tournament.I would also posit the death of Anthony Bourdain, a champion of crayfish, as a sentimental boost – but with the dog days of summer warming our rivers, it may be that there are just a lot about.Behind the restaurant’s oyster bar – an ice mound of crabs and oysters, backed by a thick skyline of succulents – Emberson poaches crayfish the size of his hand for 10\u0026nbspminutes in a broth of dill, salt and unfiltered lager. To eat, you must split the crayfish in two (once cool), cracking the tail like you would pop a pill from a blister pack, and suck out the head.The meat is released in small, tender strips, densely flavoured with salted broth. It is labour-intensive and frenzied but communal and anti-social-media. Finger bowls aside, you can’t text while eating this crayfish. We\u0026nbsphave it with marie rose sauce (and soda bread) while sitting in a pale-pink room – both roughly the colour of a crayfish seconds after death. It is a poignant, if accidental, touch.Signal crayfish arrived in the UK in the 1970s as food. Some escaped their cages and proliferated. They are larger than our native crayfish and they eat fish – and occasionally one another. They also spread a plague to which they are immune and are thus decimating the native population. As living creatures, there is very little to like. Dead, however, there is plenty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2536fb7506308ffd8fbd10fd54515561fb52d79d/148_0_5852_4000/master/5852.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c742f438a3ace084320943b37a320051 700w","title":"does more prize money make athletes run faster","story":"Ultramarathons have never had big financial rewards. A trophy, a T-shirt and maybe some free trainers is considered a good haul – but is that about to change?Would you be more likely to set a personal best in your next race if someone offered you £100? How about £1,000? Or even £5,000? The people behind the Ultra Gobi, a 400km single-stage desert race in China, are hoping to find out whether money can make a difference by announcing a $10,000 prize for anyone who breaks the 71-hour course record.“In 2017, Dan Lawson laid down an incredible gauntlet in the Gobi” says Pavel Toropov, the race director. “This unparalleled prize is a tribute to that performance and an incentive for the best endurance athletes in the world to challenge it.”Prize money in distance running is nothing new. Elite marathon runners receive significant appearance fees just to turn up and get six-figure sums for winning big races and setting records. Last year, Eliud Kipchoge was reportedly paid $1m to take part in Nike’s Breaking2 project and would have received a bonus had he broken two hours.But barring a few isolated examples, ultramarathons have traditionally been lacking in major financial rewards. A trophy, a T-shirt and maybe some free trainers is considered a good haul. I once won some money for finishing on the podium in a trail run in Hong Kong – it worked out as just under £3 for each hour raced. But, given the rising global popularity of the sport, this is may change, with other races and sponsors choosing to follow Ultra Gobi’s example.There are two clear ways in which increased prize money is likely to improve results: the depth of the field and the intensity of preparation.Undoubtedly, prize money draws more competitors. Although ultra-running has become more popular, only a tiny proportion of the population ever test themselves over such long distances. If a greater pool of talented athletes were running ultramarathons then winning times should be faster.The East African Rift valley, home to many of the world’s greatest distance runners, offers a powerful illustration. Winning marathons has become the best route out of rural poverty. Competitive running is a central part of life in many communities, with almost every ambitious youngster trying their hand. But the absence of prize money has been cited a reason for the lack of Kenyan athletes in ultra-running. Were this to change, it’s easy to see how standards could be raised.Super-ultra-distance races such as the Ultra Gobi suffer from specific challenges in attracting the best athletes. I can personally attest to the fact that running across the desert for three or four days with little or no sleep takes an enormous toll on runners’ bodies and can require significant recovery time. The money is thus a way to compensate athletes who might otherwise have chosen to compete in several shorter races.The second area in which prize money can be transformative is training. Sponsorship opportunities, primarily from shoe companies such as Altra, Hoka and Salamon have enabled a few elite ultra-runners to turn professional. However, many of the best endurance runners still combine training and racing with part-time jobs. Dan Lawson juggles running for Great Britain’s 24-hour team with cycle deliveries and running a service for recycling running kit.Prize money in ultra-running would enable more full-time professionals. Their preparation would also be enhanced by better access to facilities, be that high-altitude training, teams of support professional or simply more comfortable prerace transport and accommodation. (I have known some of the best runners sleep in airport lounges before competing in high profile events.)There is of course the risk that the incentive of prize money leads to less welcome training innovations. Ultra-running is in many ways ideally suited to illegal doping. Although there have been a few isolated cases, it is generally considered to be a clean sport, unlike marathon running or cycling. Big money could provide the motivation and the means for this to change.But what about the impact of money on a runner during a race? All endurance sports involve a tussle between mind and body. In his excellent new book, Endure, Alex Hutchinson carefully analyses the physical limits and, more importantly, the mental limits our brains impose to keep us safe. Hence the burst of energy upon seeing the finish line that, a few minutes previously, would have seemed impossible.The late stages of an ultramarathon are often as much about determination and desire as anything else. In a life-or-death situation most of us could push a little harder. And money can be a good motivator. A 1986 study found that people could sustain a wall-sit for longer if they were paid. As Hutchinson says: “It’s sort of like being chased by a lion without the danger of getting eaten.”Endurance athletes may just be different. Underfed students with no other reason may sustain meaningless pain for a few minutes longer in return for some cash. Competitive ultramarathon runners have already chosen an extremely painful hobby and are likely to be driven by intrinsic motivation. In Hutchinson’s words, for “well-trained athletes, motivation may well be pretty close to maximal already”. Based on my own experience at the end of the Ultra Gobi, nothing short of an actual lion could have made me go any faster.There are some who are resistant to the introduction of big money into ultramarathon running. Fears around camaraderie, honesty and sportsmanship are valid, but I believe it can be transformative for the sport. Those nostalgic for the days of amateur athletics often overlook the fact that it was largely the preserve of the wealthy. Only people with private means can afford to dedicate themselves fully to an unpaid hobby. Consequently, many talented athletes lost the opportunity to realise their potential, and fans were prevented from seeing the best performances, as the sad case of John Tarrant (AKA the Ghost Runner) so starkly shows.Bigger prize money in ultramarathons can enable a wider pool of athletes to dedicate more time and be better prepared. This will improve competition and standards. As a follower of the sport, the prospect of watching incredible runners break records and push boundaries is exciting, providing it is accompanied by appropriate safeguards to keep the sport clean and fair.Whether or not this money will drive inidual runners to dig deeper is a more debatable point. Having seen the grit and determination shown by elite ultra-runners I am sceptical. Even the facial expressions of a runner such as Zach Miller show that he is operating close to his mental limits. It will take a very well-funded randomised control trial to find out for sure. I also suspect that some records, like Yiannis Kouris’s 303.5km 24-hour run, could withstand almost any amount of funding."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee142a25de075d3dda4e1dffc46bb3dbb53a3a51/579_777_3149_1890/master/3149.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29b8d07ee6995ffec3a798497e2dd4d6","title":"radical plans to end huge costs of buying a freehold unveiled","story":"Law Commission draws up options enabling leaseholders to extend or buy more cheaply Millions of homeowners caught in the so-called “leasehold trap” may be able to buy their freeholds at a fraction of the price currently demanded by ground rent companies, under radical proposals from the Law Commission.One proposal is for a simple formula where leaseholders will pay just 10 times their current ground rent to convert their property from leasehold to freehold. There are 4.2m leasehold properties in England, and around half are on leases of under 80 years, leaving residents vulnerable to what critics say are rapacious demands from freeholders for lease extensions. With ground rents averaging around £370 a year, that suggests a cost of £3,700 – far less than the £10,000 to £40,000 typically sought from a leaseholder for a flat valued at £200,000 with fewer than 80 years left on the lease.Its second option is to standardise the existing regime for leasehold valuations, removing a complicated element called “marriage value” that it said currently increases the cost paid by leaseholders. The Law Commission also proposed new formulas for leaseholders who extend their lease rather than buying the freehold. It suggested that they could have a right to extend the lease for up to 250 years, and no longer have to pay ground rents. The Law Commission said proposals were only at an outline stage, and that a full consultation document would not be published until the autumn, with new rules unlikely until summer 2019.Any changes to the calculation of leasehold extensions is likely to meet fierce resistance from freeholders, with the fortunes of Britain’s wealthiest aristocrats, such as the Duke of Westminster, rooted in lucrative leasehold property estates in central London.A legal challenge to existing leasehold valuations – which estimated that leaseholders were overpaying by hundreds of millions of pounds every year – was rejected by the Court of Appeal earlier this year. The Law Commission said it would have to ensure that “sufficient compensation” was paid to landlords. “Any changes to the law that government takes forward will have to comply with human rights legislation and take account of the impact of reform.“And while some changes – in particular the options that we have been asked to present to reduce the premium payable by leaseholders – will inevitably benefit leaseholders at the expense of landlords, that is not the case across the board.”Campaigners for leasehold reform, who demonstrated outside parliament on Wednesday, welcomed the proposals. Sebastian O’Kelly of the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership said: “Lease extension and enfranchisement – the buying of the freehold – are two highly lucrative rackets.“The mathematical formulae agreed by the courts were obligingly provided by estate agents for the richest freehold owners in the country. The only way to end this racket is a fixed formula of annual multiples of ground rent, as exists in Northern Ireland and Scotland, then your home is truly yours.”Around one in five new-build houses in recent years – and almost every flat – have been sold as leasehold, some with spiralling ground rents that have made selling them near impossible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7703772a135a052d6c48e76d27a957207816874/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72ee47737c830d15c4dec4a0e09c253a","title":"how to spend it the shopping list for the 1 percent","story":"In an age of astonishing wealth, nothing reveals the lives of the ultra-rich like the FT’s unashamedly ostentatious luxury magazine. On 7 October 1967, the Financial Times, then the most buttoned-up newspaper in Britain and quite possibly the world, discreetly added a regular new page to its Saturday edition. Buried deep inside the paper, behind the usual thicket of articles about share prices and companies and pensions, the page was introduced to readers a little euphemistically, as “a guide to good living”. In small letters across the top of the page, the FT spelled out what “good living” meant. The page was called How to Spend It.In the still slightly austere postwar Britain of 1967, where the great majority of the FT’s prosperous readership of 150,000 lived, spending opportunities were limited. The new, monochrome page had an article about installing home central heating, then a relative luxury about a new electric coffee maker and about how to select and cook a pheasant: “Choose carefully. Hens are always best.” The most expansive piece was on an old-fashioned Scottish hotel owned by state-run British Rail. “The visitor is received with all the ceremony of an arrival at a country house,” wrote the reviewer. “You go into the immense hall and no one takes any notice.”The original one-page section has swelled into a thick, lustrous, large-format magazine, almost the size of a tabloid newspaper, which now appears 34 times a year, distributed with the FT across the world on Fridays and weekends. There is also an elaborate website, updated daily – and, unlike the FT’s main website, presented without a paywall. Under consumer capitalism, you are what you buy – or would like to buy. But the rich are different from everyone else in their consumption, because they can afford almost anything. Their challenge is choosing. The key role in this process played over decades by How to Spend It has made it an almost unique social lens, through which we can see how much the world has polarised since the egalitarian 1960s and 70s.Together, the magazine and website form “an elegant luxury environment for readers and advertisers”, as the FT’s promotional material puts it. At How to Spend It, “the world’s most desirable audience, with the largest purchasing power and highest net worth” is – in theory at least – judiciously steered by expert FT journalists towards the correct purchasing decisions. The magazine usually has between 80 and 100 pages. About half of them are advertisements, for the biggest global luxury brands and for more singular commodities, such as art and property. The other pages are a gleaming parade of articles – not always easy to tell from the ads – about the most expensive fashion, travel, food, interior design and other consumer goods imaginable.A long recent feature suggests “a sumptuous gastronomic tour of Spain by private jet”, three days long “from £6,995 per person”. An artfully casual page of recommended “knick-knackery” includes a “Chaumet Liens Lumière Watch in gold with diamonds and mother-of-pearl on alligator strap”, costing £12,870. A 2012 article on home furnishings with an aeronautical theme included a decommissioned Sky Flash air-to-air missile, polished to a perfect sheen and mounted on a pedestal: “This could be sitting in your drawing room for a mere £29,500.” To read How to Spend It, depending on your income level and attitude to extravagance, is to enter a world that is seductive or ridiculous, escapist or intimidating, a voyeuristic thrill or utterly enraging – and possibly all at the same time.Most consumer journalism draws readers to products within, or just beyond, their financial reach. But How to Spend It “is not aspirational”, says Qing Wang, a professor at Warwick Business School and an authority on the consumption habits of the very wealthy. “It’s for those who’ve made it, for the exclusive enjoyment of them and their kind.” Not all How to Spend It readers are rich, but a lot of them are. According to the FT, “Half have or would consider paying $14,000+ on a high-end watch” and “1 in 5 have or would consider using the service of a private jet”.Wang says: “How to Spend It can be sophisticated, but in the end, it’s all about status. Many of its readers are bankers, or businessmen from China and India – quite blunt people. They like the magazine’s directness. They pick it up thinking: ‘Just tell me what I need.’”“The magazine has a great conversion rate for advertisers,” or turning ads into sales, says Alice Pickthall of the media research firm Enders Analysis. A former FT journalist says: “Some readers take How to Spend It into a shop, point at a picture in it, and say: ‘I want that watch.’ It’s the Argos catalogue for rich people.”The consumption habits of this elite matter increasingly to all of us the spending decisions of the rich are now economic and social forces of enormous power. “As the rich have been getting progressively richer,” an analysis by the US investment bank Citigroup found in 2005, they have been “saving less and spending more”. Unlike other consumers, the report went on, the rich find many products, such as designer clothes, more desirable the more expensive they become. The countries where the rich congregate, such as Britain, Canada and the US, have been changed radically by this frenzy of spending: they have become “Plutonomies – economies powered by the wealthy”.Another sign of a plutonomy is that more and more high-profile institutions – universities, museums, media organisations – are dependent on the wealthy for funding or subsidy. Today’s FT is more cosmopolitan and influential than when it produced its first How to Spend It page in 1967. It is one of the most prestigious and important newspapers in the world. Less than a third of its 900,000 subscribers now live in the UK and as well as authoritative business reporting, it is increasingly known for its urbane tone and its investigations – notably in recent months about sexual harassment at the Houses of Parliament and the (now disbanded) Presidents Club in London, and about alleged bullying at the British advertising giant WPP.Yet the FT is also a less secure paper than it was half a century ago, with print media in decline and the advertising revenues from online journalism uncertain. In 2015, the paper was sold for £844m by its owners since 1957, Pearson, to the Japanese media company Nikkei. In 2016, the latest year for which accounts are available, the FT as a whole made a pre-tax profit of £6.2m on revenues of £311m: a substantial success for a traditional media brand, but a thin profit margin by corporate standards.Nobody outside the FT knows exactly how much of that revenue comes from the advertisements in How to Spend It. Like other papers, the FT does not release financial results for inidual supplements. But periodically there are proud hints from the FT’s management. In 2001, the then editor Andrew Gowers said the magazine had been “profitable from the first issue”. In 2007, the FT’s current chief executive John Ridding described How to Spend It as “a fantastic franchise”. Julia Carrick, who conceived the How to Spend It magazine and was its publisher until 2015, told me: “Some of the issues were way over £1m in profit.” At its current publication rate, a conservative estimate of How to Spend It’s annual profits would be above £10m.At a recent meeting of FT executives, convened to discuss the long-term future of the paper, the current editor, Lionel Barber, reportedly declared: “What we need is another How to Spend It.” Among senior FT management, a piece of melodramatic business jargon is sometimes used to describe the importance of How to Spend It and its editor since 1998, Gillian de Bono, to the FT’s continued existence. They are said to be “mission-critical”.How to Spend It and its readers usually radiate confidence. But its pages also inadvertently reveal that the rich have anxieties. Unlike in many other luxury magazines, almost everything covered is extremely expensive. Most products have the same kind of satiny, unblemished finish, both showy and perfectionist. Interiors are invariably neat. Interviewees are immaculate in their dress and speech. Everything is under control. Only rarely and awkwardly are references made to relevant but unsettling events outside this carefully curated world. “Post-protracted recession, repression and years of general national malaise, Zimbabwe,” an article announced in May, “is now one of the most exciting places to safari on the African continent.” As one of the magazine’s staff puts it, “Gillian gives readers permission to be rich and not feel guilty.” (This escapist approach may have attracted at least one infamous reader: in 2011, a reportedly “well-thumbed” copy of How to Spend It was found in a compound belonging to the besieged Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.)Yet while it reinforces the rich’s sense of entitlement – their sense that the world is their playground – How to Spend It also serves to remind them that they frequently lack taste. With striking bluntness, the magazine’s name says as much. “Compared with the truly fashionable, who are often less well-off, and have acquired their edge by having to choose between products,” says a prominent British writer on class and style, “seriously rich people are often ever so slightly behind the beat.”In an age of mass luxury – of mobbed designer concessions in department stores, of designer shops proliferating in seemingly every major city – how can the rich stand out? How to Spend It often advises its readers to buy limited-edition or hand-made goods. But sometimes the discernment required seems never-ending. In an issue in May, the British designer of upper-class menswear Jeremy Hackett recommended a London shoemaker, George Cleverley, whose bespoke products cost “from £3,600”. “My current order,” said Hackett, “is for some tan and white Oxfords … made from a batch of reindeer leather salvaged from the Metta Catharina – a 53-ton brigantine that sank off the southern coast of England during a voyage from St Petersburg to Genoa in 1786. The leather was tanned in St Petersburg by artisans whose techniques were secret for centuries … ” Hackett might have been joking – except that How to Spend It doesn’t do jokes.There are rarely any people in its formal, crystalline photos of palatial hotels and homes, as if readers need to have these places to themselves, as sanctuaries from the rest of the world. “How to Spend It sells a kind of tranquility – a promise that luxurious products and experiences will have a restorative effect,” Qing Wang says. “That’s what many of its readers need.”Unlike the wealthy of previous gilded ages, most of today’s rich have made their own money. Many are workaholics. “They are time-poor. They want instant satisfaction – and they also want relaxation,” adds Wang. It has been the lucrative but strenuous task of How to Spend It to fulfil these contradictory needs.How to Spend It began as a more carefree enterprise: the product of a reader’s letter and an extramarital affair. In 1958, Sheila Black, a clever former actor who was married to a tabloid editor, wrote to the then editor of the FT, the famously staid Sir Gordon Newton, to complain that his business newspaper rarely actually wrote about consumer goods. Newton responded by hiring her. She became the FT’s first female journalist, first consumer reporter, and Newton’s lover.The FT can be a conservative place, and it took nine years for Black’s work to be formalised as the How to Spend It page. She and a tiny staff were given their own office, to which Newton “would go in the evening to share a gin and tonic with Black,” her FT obituary recorded after she died in 2007. “Other staff usually took the hint and left.”Newton retired in 1972, and Black left the paper with him. For the next decade and a half, How to Spend It remained a minor part of the FT, a double-page spread at best, with breezy articles about women’s sandals, or collecting carved wooden birds sometimes it was part of a section in the paper a little patronisingly called Diversions. A puritanism lingered among the paper’s readers, and some of them objected to the name How to Spend It. In 1982, with Britain emerging unsteadily from a deep recession, one wrote to complain that the name was “inapposite to our time, vulgar and an affront”.“I sat there shaking in my shoes at the criticism,” recalled Black’s successor as How to Spend It editor, Lucia van der Post. “But I decided to publish the letter on my pages, and let the readers decide about the name, with the best response winning a case of champagne.”The section kept its name. During the mid-80s, it began to cover more luxurious products. But it did so with a degree of irony and caution. A 1985 piece about designer sunglasses reassured readers that they were “no longer just for Mafia bosses” but “an acceptable accoutrement for gentlemen”. A 1990 piece described vintage grand pianos as “a reasonable investment”. Van der Post was the daughter of the explorer and conservationist Laurens van der Post, best known for celebrating the ascetic lives of African Bushmen. The contrast between his and her attitudes to possessions seemed striking – the shift to a more materialistic world in a single family. But she wrote with infectious enthusiasm about “whatever interested me”, she told me, and she acquired a cult readership.Demand for prestige goods grew, and their prices rose sharply. Since 1982, the American business magazine Forbes has been tracking the cost of the same 40 “ultraluxe items”, such as caviar and tennis courts, to create what it calls a “Cost of Living Extremely Well Index”. This index has risen almost twice as fast as the cost of consumer goods overall.The person who has made it so since, more than anyone else, is Gillian de Bono. She joined the FT in 1994, to help Van der Post, who was not an experienced editor, run How to Spend It. De Bono was in her early 40s, and had already edited women’s magazines and the consumer journal Which? It was a populist rather than elite CV, but she had a reputation for limitless energy and fastidiousness. In 1998, Van der Post returned to full-time writing, and De Bono succeeded her as editor.One of its most fascinating but brazen regular items is a close look at the consumer desires of an inidual, titled “the Aesthete”. As its name suggests, the page is meant to be more about taste than price – a chance to show connoisseurship. But rich people and costly products predominate. In 2012, with Britain enduring the austerity policies of George Osborne, the page featured the Conservative chancellor’s father, Sir Peter Osborne. He revealed that he had his eye on a “wonderful” desk costing £19,000, and had recently been “lent a villa by an Italian friend” on the exclusive Caribbean island of Mustique.Like many of the rich themselves, the pages of How to Spend It have spent the turbulent decade since the financial crisis in a state of comfortable equilibrium, at the very least. “The design hasn’t changed for 10 years,” says a former staff member. The articles still unfurl in wide, stately columns the enormous photos of products are still precisely arranged and white-bordered, as if for an unusually elegant catalogue. The few pictures of people are usually of artisan producers, characterfully lined and smiling, like trusty retainers on an idealised country estate.In some ways, this conservatism is precisely what makes How to Spend It appealing to an itinerant international readership whose working lives are often in flux. The same goes for its association with the steady, respectable FT, and with a certain version of England – as a place to buy a handmade shotgun or a well-cut suit. London in particular has presented itself very effectively since the 90s as a civilised, slightly retro pleasure ground for the global rich, and How to Spend It has helped burnish that myth.If there is a How to Spend It ethos, De Bono has come to see herself as its  during her 20-year editorship. If she is presented with work she considers inadequate or unsuitable, she will say: “This is not How to Spend It. It’s not how we do it.”A small, formal woman in her mid-60s with a perfect bobbed haircut, De Bono rarely stops working. In 2014, she told the website Politico that organising the 20th anniversary issue, in which every product mentioned was eventually auctioned for charity, “consumed me day and night for nine months”. Carrick said: “She’s incredibly hard-working.” A staff member said: “When Gillian goes on holiday, she looks at every single page proof on her sun lounger, on a laptop, and then phones in changes.”The How to Spend It offices feel a little separate from the rest of the FT building in central London. The rest of the floor is open-plan, but How to Spend It’s space – a couple of dozen desks, and a corner office for De Bono – is behind a glass wall. The atmosphere is quiet and reverent: trophies won by the magazine and website stand prominently on a cabinet. The staff are mostly experienced journalists, men and women of varying ages, who work long days according to a weekly production rhythm that has been strictly maintained for years. A few are embarrassed by some of the material they process. “A 3,000-word piece on perfume – who’s reading that?” one asks rhetorically. But in the office they keep such thoughts to themselves. “Mind your own business, and do what you’re told – that’s the culture,” says another.Serving the rich is usually not for the faint-hearted. The industries that cater to their elaborate tastes are often very exacting and top-down: the rich expect the best, and are not squeamish about hierarchies. Luxury magazines are no exception, and staff at How to Spend It have often worked for others. But complaints about How to Spend It’s working culture have recently provoked a crisis at one of the FT’s most profitable assets.Last November, 18 of How to Spend It’s current and former staff filed a formal complaint under the FT’s whistleblower procedure, which permits serious allegations against managers to be submitted anonymously. As a result, the paper launched an internal inquiry into allegations of bullying against De Bono, going back more than a decade. The FT’s human resources department collected testimony from employees (some of whom now work on other sections of the FT), and compiled a dossier more than 40 pages long.Seven months later, on 7 June, the inquiry finally reported. Its findings were not made public. According to a summary of the report written by the FT’s director of HR, the inquiry described De Bono’s “management style” as sometimes “erratic and, at its worst, didactic, high-handed and … (by her own admission) impatient”. It said there was “a perception within the team that certain iniduals are being ‘targeted’” by De Bono. But it found that there was “not sufficient evidence of a history of harassment and bullying,” and cited “examples of Gillian evincing great thoughtfulness, understanding and empathy with iniduals in her team, even among those who accuse her.” The “inidual complaints” against her, the summary concluded, “have not been upheld.”This verdict has not satisfied many of those who took part in the inquiry. They feel that it was not sufficiently independent or thorough, and that the paper is protecting one of its editorial stars. “People at How to Spend It are angry,” says one. The National Union of Journalists is backing the complainants. On 20 June, its large chapel at the FT passed a motion criticising the inquiry and promising “to support the whistleblowers should they decide to take further action”.Over recent months, I have spoken at length to current and former How to Spend It staff. None of them have wanted to be named, or to have their complaints reported in any detail, for fear of being identified – luxury journalism is a small world. But their complaints are raw. One of them told me: “With Gillian, It’s always verbal. Sometimes, she does it one-on-one in her office, with the door shut. Sometimes, she explodes at you in front of everyone.”De Bono and Barber declined to be interviewed for this article. But an FT spokesperson said: “We can confirm that complaints about the management of How to Spend It were lodged last year. These were fully investigated in a rigorous, professional internal process. The complaints were not upheld. We are, however, actively looking at ways to better support the magazine’s continued rapid growth.”A senior FT source was franker: “We’re trying to bring the culture of How to Spend It closer to the rest of the paper … to improve its employee relations. Gillian is a tough cookie the damn thing wouldn’t work unless she was. But she is not the easiest person.”The magazine and its editor are still “mission-critical” to the FT. On 7 June, it was Barber who presented the inquiry’s conclusions to the How to Spend It staff. “Lionel marched into the How to Spend It offices,” says an FT staff member, “stood right beside Gillian, and said: ‘You work for a great magazine. Gillian is a world-class editor. But it has been a difficult time for everyone. We’re going to implement changes. And then we want to draw a line.’ He then asked for questions, but there was a stony silence.”In an age of fragmenting media, there is something old-fashioned about a single publication telling the rich how to live. Over the past dozen years, other newspapers have tried to copy the How to Spend It formula. Rival magazines and websites such as the Times’s Luxx and the Daily ’s Luxury have less clever names, but in content and format are not always easy to tell apart from the original. For now, there is enough advertising to go round: luxury magazines, being highly tactile, useful badges of status, and free of online clutter, are one of the few remaining boom areas in print media. But gauche millionaires seeking advice on shirtmakers can now shop around.In 2017, a regular survey of the luxury goods market by the management consultants Bain concluded that a “millennial state of mind” was “changing purchasing habits”, forcing companies to focus more on products that were simultaneously upmarket and downmarket, such as deliberately trashy-looking designer trainers. How to Spend It does have articles about trainers, but it prefers to write about shoes that send more reliable signals about wealth, like brogues.How to Spend It also occasionally features affordable, seemingly everyday products. In the latest issue, the Danish designer Øivind Slaatto recommends a Copenhagen restaurant for its porridge. But the need to impress is always lurking in the background. The restaurant owner, Slaatto points out, “has become a kind of rock star – he does porridge demonstrations at music festivals”. How to Spend It never stops being aware of status and nor, it implies, should its readers. For all the leisure it depicts, How to Spend It makes being rich seem hard work.In recent years, one of the places it has recommended repeatedly as a shopping destination is Mount Street in Mayfair. Once a backwater of offices and antique shops, the street has been transformed since the mid-2000s into a canyon of forbiddingly exclusive boutiques, selling designer clothes and leather goods. Staff unlock doors to let you in, then follow you solicitously but watchfully round the creamy interiors, which are a little like bank vaults, often partly subterranean and much bigger than they appear from the street.Inside the boutiques, the rest of the world recedes. There are rarely many other customers just staff waiting patiently to serve you, and walls of soft, flawless products. Mount Street is a perfect microcosm of the exquisite, sometimes airless, increasingly separate world that How to Spend It has helped construct for the rich since the 60s.But this sort of experience may no longer be what the rich desire most. An even more significant indicator of what separates them from the rest of us can be found in The Sum of Small Things, a rare clear-eyed book about the rich, published last year by Elizabeth Currid-Halkett, an American academic who studies the west’s wealthiest cities. In recent years, she argues, the rich have begun to “spend significantly less on conspicuous consumption and more on inconspicuous consumption”, such as “education, healthcare, pensions, and personal insurance”. They are buying the security and long-term elite status that are more valuable, in perilous times, than escape or pleasure.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21d61c2b8257ff9b9f66894540d0e5a63afd0038/470_0_2055_1233/master/2055.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95149e3db603bfef5dbb35d482045b2b","title":"labour draws up plans for government in case of snap election","story":"Party preparing about 35 pieces of legislation to be ready to go should it win powerLabour is privately ramping up preparations for government, holding an away day on Monday where shadow cabinet members will present plans for a leftwing populist legislative programme so the party is ready for a snap general election.The event in London will lay out plans for draft Queen’s speech of up to 35 bills and a budget intended to focus on living standards and workers’ rights.Senior figures in the party such as the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have been consulting regularly with Gordon Brown to hone their plans and ensure Labour can act quickly in government.They believe they can learn from the former prime minister. “We don’t want to repeat the mistake Brown made where he was only prepared for the first 100 days and then was faced with calls for an election,” a senior Labour source said.Senior shadow ministers have been told they must turn up with six priority proposals, as well as having firm plans for legislation over the entire parliament. “We have to think much longer-term. But also we know we would be a new government that would come under attack like no other,” the source said.The party is understood to be preparing for about 35 pieces of legislation to be ready to go should it win an election. Shadow ministers have been told the plans must be popular and radical. Proposals under consideration include abolishing zero-hours contracts, a mass housebuilding programme, nationalisation of key industries, consultations on possible rent control and lifting the public sector pay cap.Sir Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, has been meeting almost fortnightly with party advisers who have started preparing legislation and briefing party staff on how Whitehall operates. The party wants shadow cabinet members to know whom they would have the power to appoint on their first day in office and how civil service aides would be assigned. Labour has taken the lead in the polls as voters digest Theresa May’s new Brexit policy, outlined at Chequers, in which she has proposed following EU rules for food and goods. This week a YouGov poll put Labour five points ahead of the Tories.No general election is scheduled until 2022, but the febrile atmosphere in Westminster and the deep isions in the Conservative party have fuelled speculation that May could be left with no choice but to call an early poll. Tory remainer rebels reported on Tuesday night that whips had threatened them with the spectre of a no-confidence vote in May and an early election should they vote in favour of a customs union amendment.Most of the Labour candidates in marginal seats have been selected in preparation for any snap election, including Faiza Shaheen, the director of the Class thinktank, who will take on Iain Duncan Smith in Chingford and Woodford Green. Some have already had to step aside either because of the demands of the role or an embarrassing revelation. Mandy Richards, selected in Worcester, was dropped after it was revealed she had made “false and vexatious claims” against MI5 and MI6 and a long list of others, including her GP and Thames Water. Another candidate, Tara-Mary Lyons, was dropped after it emerged she had huge business debts that had not been disclosed to the party. Privately, party sources acknowledge that a populist policy programme in the first Queen’s speech would be essential if the party found itself as a minority government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05dea2b553adc58b4d41dbb0e644d9e0e17fbae8/0_162_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee02ed10abe65704f6355acc7ef9f0f9","title":"no plan in place for brexit driving permits surge say auditors","story":"Post offices could need to issue up to 7m international driving permits in first yearThe government has no business plan if post offices are forced to issue up to 7m international driving permits in a single year in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Whitehall’s spending watchdog has disclosed.A National Audit Office report examining the Department for Transport’s readiness for leaving the EU also expresses concern that plans to manage traffic flow at Dover without a deal are behind schedule. All government departments are expected to have full contingency plans in place in case the UK withdraws from the EU in March 2019 without an agreement. The NAO found that the DfT “still has much to do” and there was an increasing risk that projects would not be delivered on time. Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said: “These are extraordinary times for the civil service and the government. The department has achieved a great deal in its preparations but over the coming months it will, like many other departments, need to scramble to prepare for the UK’s EU exit, particularly if we are faced with a no-deal scenario.”Auditors expressed concern that there was no detailed plan or business case for issuing international driving permits en masse to UK motorists. These permits may be needed for Britons to drive legally in the EU if no agreement is reached on mutual recognition of existing driving licences.Whitehall has decided to switch the new driving permits system from a digital to a paper-based “solution”, according to the report. Civil servants believe that up to 7m permits could be requested in the first 12 months after Brexit. At present, 89 post offices issue 100,000 international driving permits a year. Auditors also noted that plans were still being finalised for Project Brock, a Highways England scheme to deal with lorry queues on roads to Dover for cross-Channel journeys. A government spokesman said: “We have prioritised preparation for EU exit and royal assent of the haulage permits and trailer registration bill will be a significant step in this process. “Our work is part of wider government preparations to ensure the UK can deliver a smooth and orderly Brexit, as we move from our current membership of the EU to our future partnership.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3162a94d2ce2f5f75c537a803e7be482a92b55e5/0_447_7500_4499/master/7500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38a040323be4dc1bb828d6c9cd73e5fb","title":"astronomy photographer of the year 2018 shortlist in pictures","story":"The Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy and the Running Man nebula feature in the shortlist for the Insight Investment Astronomy Photographer of the Year award.

I’m very confident that Mercedes is the right place to be over the coming years. Although we have enjoyed so much success together since 2013, Mercedes is hungrier than ever.“The competitive passion that burns bright inside me is shared by every single member of this group - always chasing the next improvement and digging even deeper to make sure we come out on top. I can’t wait to see what we can achieve together in the next two-and-a-half seasons.”Despite the long-running saga over whether Hamilton would sign on again with the team, Mercedes were confident the deal would be done and said they were waiting for the “right time” to announce it. In the end they have chosen their home grand prix at Hockenheim after teasing the news on Twitter on Thursday morning. “We signed the final documents this week and didn’t want to keep people waiting any longer,” said the Mercedes executive director Toto Wolff. “There is not much about Lewis as a Formula One driver that hasn’t been said already - he is one of the all-time greats and his track record speaks for itself.“But what I enjoy most about working with him is getting to know the man inside the racing helmet: his relentless drive for self-improvement, his emotional intelligence as a team member and his loyalty to those around him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fad7a8a62bdafc17fc95ba5e69a5e7ea5b849ac/0_57_3240_1944/master/3240.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21a4c145c6f9bf6aed9b83dd59d1f2f7","title":"talking horses why its mad to let anabolic steroid sinners return","story":"How will you feel the next time Philip Fenton has a big winner, knowing he was caught in possession of anabolic steroids?How will you feel the next time Philip Fenton trains the winner of a major race, perhaps at the Cheltenham Festival, perhaps even in the Gold Cup itself? That, for me, is a key question in considering whether it’s a good idea to let him have his trainer’s licence back. My answers are that I’ll feel heartily sick and that it’s a terrible idea. For those of you who don’t recall, Fenton was found to have two kinds of anabolic steroid at his stable when it was raided by government vets in 2012, leading to him being fined by a court and banned from racing for three years, but he’s a trainer once more and will have a runner today. Has Fenton uttered one word of contrition? If so, I haven’t seen it reported. Apparently, he told Ireland’s licensing committee that he had “learned his lesson” but we are left to guess what lesson that might be. Don’t leave banned substances kicking around the yard, perhaps. Racing has stepped up its fight against steroid use in recent years but it would be naive to imagine that every sinner gets caught. Anabolics flush quickly through a horse’s system and, although they would still show up in a hair test a long time later, that form of testing remains in its infancy. In those circumstances, it is utterly mad to allow someone with Fenton’s history to come back as a trainer. Ruling bodies on both sides of the Irish Sea should be making it clear that anyone caught in possession of anabolic steroids will never again be seen as a fit and proper person to hold a licence. I’m thoroughly disappointed that racing hasn’t yet taken that approach. We are allowing cheats to think that it wouldn’t be the end of the world, even if they were caught. Setting such hideous thoughts to one side, I turn to today’s racing. The one that catches my eye this afternoon is Vera Drake (3.30) at Hamilton, where she is the only three-year-old in a staying handicap and is therefore given every chance by the way the weight-for-age scale works half of the last 10 runnings of this race have been won by three-year-olds. This chestnut is still a maiden and has a row of ‘2’s next to her name but she’s been steadily progressive against her own age-group and was only beaten a head last time. This extra furlong and the addition of Paul Hanagan seem like positives and 9-2 is available. Highland Acclaim (7.05) is the 3-1 nap at Epsom tonight. His course figures are 171131 and, although he was beaten on his only attempt at today’s seven furlongs there, I think that had a lot to do with forcing tactics. He remains on a very reasonable mark and Handytalk, the rival I was most worried about, has been withdrawn. There seems to be plenty of support around for Player’s Luck (9.05) at Doncaster. A Roger Varian three-year-old, he went close on his handicap debut just five days ago and now has Andrea Atzeni aboard for the first time, with the extra distance likely to suit.

He stays at two under. Meanwhile, up at 18, Kisner has chipped out of the bunker and has a tiddler for par and a round of 66.Birdie for Brandon Stone on 14! The 25-year-old South African moves to four under. Sung Kang has dropped a shot on 13, so all of a sudden Yusaku Miyazato is all alone at three under.Jon Rahm, fourth in the Masters this year, has made a solid start with birdies at 3, 5 and 6 sandwiching a bogey at 4. He’s in the bunch at -2, but Patrick Cantlay isn’t – a double bogey on the last sends him rattling past Rahm and co and back to -1 in the clubhouse.Cantlay, somehow, was rescued by a bridge. The ball pinged away from the wet stuff but it was out of the frying pan and into the fire – he has to lay up out of a bunker.Patrick Cantlay, three under, goes right on 18 and he’s in the burn by the looks of it. Kisner, meanwhile, maintains his lead by fizzing his putt in on 17.In fact Kisner’s ball has rolled into the bunker at the front of the green – he splashes out but faces a 20-odd footer to save par.Kisner slices his drive on 17 right and sends it deep into the rough stuff but a solid second shot has the ball rolling up to the front edge of the green. Also off-roading is Justin Rose back at 9 … but he manages to send his second shot into the heart of the green.Hello all. Spieth has just rolled in his put for a remarkable par, while Kisner has also holed a par putt on 16.With that, I’m going to hand over to John Ashdown ... and I’ll see you again later!Pat Perez tied for 20th the last time the Open was contested at Carnoustie. The 42-year-old from Phoenix, Arizona obviously likes the place, and he’s just joined the group at -3 with birdie at 10. Thomas Pieters is going along nicely, too: birdies at 10, 14 and 15 have taken him up the leaderboard to -2. Chesson Hadley drops his first stroke of the day at 11 he’s -2. And Kevin Chappell followed up that eagle on 14 with dropped shots at 15 and 16. He ends up with an acceptable but ultimately disappointing 70.What a shot by Jordan Spieth! He’s sent his tee shot at 7 into a bunker with a large, looming face. He doesn’t have much room for his backswing, either, the ball having only just toppled into the sand. There’s a fair chance he’ll wheech that straight into the face. If your average punter tries to reach the green, instead of taking their medicine and chipping out, the ball would almost certainly come flying back towards the teeth soon to be uprooted from their startled face. But he manages to lift the ball up quickly, out and over the bunker, and into the heart of the putting surface! That’s quite astonishing from where he was. Nerves of steel. He really is quite the showman. His clean-cut apple-pie image tends to obscure his swashbuckling brilliance. You can bet Seve would have approved. He can’t quite make the 20-footer he’s left with, the birdie putt stopping just short of the cup, but you get the general point.Kevin Kisner has already tasted a little success in 2018, reaching the final of the WGC Match Play. He eventually lost that one to Bubba Watson. He’s never done a great deal at the Open ... until now! Three birdies in a row, at 13, 14 and 15, and he’s the new leader of the 147th Open Championship!Jordan Spieth leaves his chip well short of the flag, and the ball comes toppling back down a slope. He’s left with a 12-footer for his par ... but no worries, in it goes. That’s a highly decent save in the end, because that was a real battle. Justin Rose yips a tiddler for birdie, and responds by bollocking someone in the gallery. But really there’s no excuse for that, even if the crowd had broken out into an impromptu ceilidh. Meanwhile there’s back-to-back birdies for Patrick Cantlay, at 13 and 14. And the Japanese veteran Yusaku Miyazato, who has never made the cut in his previous three appearances at the Open, has followed up his opening-hole bogey with birdies at 2, 6, 8 and now 10. Willett can’t make his par saver. It’s a bogey-bogey finish, and in that context he’ll be disappointed with his 69. But given his troubles since winning the Masters, this is a most acceptable return to major-championship form. Jordan Spieth meanwhile is struggling his way up Hogan’s Alley. His drive at the par-five 6th finds a bunker on the right. He can only splash out. Then he slices his third into rough to the right of the green. He’ll have to work hard if he wants to get up and down from there.Danny Willett’s fine round is in danger of ending in anticlimactic fashion. He’s whistled his tee shot at 18 into thick cabbage down the left, and dumped his second into the bunker guarding the front left of the green. A splash out to ten feet he’ll at least have a chance to save his par. Back on 5, Jon Rahm’s up-and-down start continues, rolling in a 30-footer for a birdie that brings him back to -1.Van Rooyen sends his third at 18 down a small bank to the left of the green. He elects to putt up, but leaves his par effort a good five feet short. That’s left a nerve-tickler. He knocks it in, and that’s a decent bogey given where his drive ended up. He’s the early clubhouse leader with a 67. And his partner Matthew Southgate scribbles his name at the bottom of a 69. Meanwhile after a steady start by Justin Rose, Hartley Wintney’s finest guides in a 12-foot left-to-right curler for birdie on 5. He’s -1. Jordan Spieth was inside him, and had a read, but doesn’t hit his birdie chance and the ball dies to the right. He remains at -2.Jordan Spieth is beginning to purr: a birdie at 4, and this is a fast start by the defending champion and three-time major winner. He’s -2. Tony Finau has sprung out of the blocks too: birdies at 1 and 2, for a player who finished in the top ten at the Masters, then the top five at the US Open. Jon Rahm hands back his birdie immediately with bogey at 4, the result of an errant drive down the left that found a ditch. And after missing that short birdie chance on 16, Danny Willett lets another short one slide past, this time for par on 17. He drops to -3.Trouble for the leader Erik van Rooyen. He hasn’t put a foot wrong all day ... but now he’s found a bunker down the right of 18, and can only take his medicine, wedging out. He’ll need to get down in two from distance if his card is to remain free of blemishes.At the long par-three 16th, Danny Willett bumps his tee shot to six feet, leaving a little left-to-right breaker coming back. But he prods at the putt tentatively, letting the chance slip by. Kevin Chappell sends a tramliner into the cup from 50 feet on 14. An eagle that catapults him up the leaderboard.Rickie Fowler makes his first move of the week! He’s facing a snaking 50-footer on 3, and sends it dropping, perfectly weighted, into the cup! He raises his putter in the air as the gallery salute a very popular player. The new Sergio? Well, everyone’s desperate for him to break his major duck. God speed, Rickie! His playing partner Jon Rahm makes birdie too, though he’s very close to making eagle, having crashed a driver onto the green to 15 feet, then left his putt an inch or so high on the right. They’re both -1.Brandon Stone, Mr 60, rolls another confident birdie putt straight into the middle of the cup. He rises to -3, along with Chesson Hadley, who adds birdie at 7 to those earlier efforts at 3 and 4. The 31-year-old North Carolinian has only played in one previous Open, missing the cut at Hoylake in 2013. He’s looking to make a huge improvement to that record in short order. Meanwhile Jordan Spieth can’t convert his good birdie chance at 3, while Kiradech Aphibarnrat leaves the scene having made double bogey.The first man out is the first man back in. Sandy Lyle had been -1 at the turn, but on the way back he bogeyed 10, 17 and 18, and doubled 13. That’s a very disappointing 75 for the 1985 champion. At 60 years of age, this could have been his penultimate round in Open competition. The great man gave it a good go. Meanwhile a pair of 71s for his partners Martin Kaymer and Andy Sullivan. That’s particularly disappointing for Kaymer, who had been gingerly feeling his way back into form, but bogeyed 16 and 17.Here’s how quickly things can go wrong on a links course. Kiradech Aphibarnrat made a brilliant birdie at 1. He was an inch away from guiding in another birdie putt from distance at 2. And now he’s making a real pig’s lug of 3, having taken one club too many off the tee and carelessly finding a pot bunker. Going aggressively for the green, he dumps his second into Jockie’s Burn. Meanwhile Jordan Spieth takes advantage of his good fortune again - hey, this is what true champions do - by wedging to ten feet.That birdie’s not settled Spieth down totally. He’s just hitting a 7-iron off the 3rd tee, but pushes it right. Again he gets a lucky bounce out of some thick rough, the ball kicking left and back onto the fairway. Things are going his way at the moment. They’re certainly going Erik van Rooyen’s way: he trundles in a monster on 15 to reclaim sole ownership of the lead at -5! And the big-hitting Gary Woodland keeps on truckin’, with his third birdie in four holes, at 6. Here’s the top-ten countdown, pop pickers.If you want to win the Open, you need a couple of good breaks along the way. Jordan Spieth will know that as well as anyone, after those shenanigans on 13 at Birkdale last year. And having sent his drive into the thick rough down the left of 2, he then pulls his second into the green. But his ball takes a bounce off a hillock, kicks right, and stops six feet short of the hole! You’ve got to take those bonus opportunities, and his defence is off nicely after a slightly shaky start! He’s -1.Matthew Southgate eagled 6 earlier on. And now he’s eagled the other par five, the 14th. He’s been on quite the run since the turn: birdie, birdie, bogey, bogey, eagle. He’s one off the lead at -3. And that lead is shared by Erik van Rooyen and Danny Willett, the former making a disappointing three-putt par on 14 after finding the green with two long irons, the latter rolling in a big one across 13 to pick up a stroke. Meanwhile a dropped shot for Martin Kaymer at 16, and another birdie for Mr 60, Brandon Stone, this time at 6. To steal Danny Boon’s catchphrase: it’s all happening!Spieth’s ball is perched atop some fluffy grass on the fringe of 1, 30 feet from the flag. He’s got no right to be shaving the hole from there, but he judges it wonderfully, and that’s exactly what he does. That’s a good par save. Par for Justin Rose, too. Meanwhile the third member of the group, the ever-entertaining Kiradech Aphibarnrat, battered a drive miles down the hole, then wedged to 12 feet. In goes the birdie putt! Aphibarnrat has an appalling record at the Open: played four, missed cuts four. He’s so much better than that. The only way is up.Kevin Kisner rattles in a long birdie putt on 8, having previously bogeyed 5 and eagled 6. Back-to-back birdies for Chesson Hadley at 3 and 4, and for Martin Kaymer at 14 and 15. They’re all at -2. Spieth meanwhile plays a loose one into 1, sending a 9-iron long and left. He’s on the fringe, but it’s a slightly uneasy start for the reigning champ.Jhonattan Vegas is in the house! He’s made it to Carnoustie in time for his 10.31am match, having suffered all sorts of problems with visa clearance, delayed flights and lost clubs. He’s on the range, testing some irons, while his caddy rips the cellophane off a brand new bag from the pro shop. Out come big hunks of cardboard, Silica gel packets, etc., from the pockets. That was close. Also in the area: the defending champion Jordan Spieth! The hero of Birkdale claps an iron down the right of the fairway, and is one joule of energy from rolling into a bunker. A fair bit of adrenaline powering that one. But he’ll be fine. His partner Justin Rose finds the middle of the parched fairway.Kevin Chappell turns in 34, having birdied 1 and now 9: he’s -2. Gary Woodland birdies 3 after crashing his drive over Jockie’s Burn and the back of the green! He moves to -1, then to -2 with another at 4. Bogey for Matt Southgate at 12 he drops back to -2. And Yuta Ikeda is going along nicely: after that birdie at 2, he dropped a shot at 3 but has bounced back with birdies at 4 and 6. Tyrrell Hatton was highly fancied going into this week, off the back of a top-ten finish at the US Open and a good showing at last week’s Scottish Open. But he’s started out disastrously today: bogeys at 3, 5, 6 and now 7. He’s propping up the entire leaderboard at +4. Better news for Brandon Stone, who missed an eight-footer to become the first man to shoot 59 on the European Tour last week at Gullane - but won the Scottish Open anyway. He birdies 4 to join a big group at -1.And it’s another birdie for Danny Willett at 10! He sends his second straight at the flag, then rolls in the eight-footer with confidence. This is great to watch.Rafa Cabrera Bello, going well after an opening-hole birdie, yips from a couple of feet at 5. The ball nearly missed the hole altogether! He’s back to level par. Some positive moves at the top, though: another birdie for Patrick Cantlay at 6, and then Matt Southgate follows birdie at 10 with a monster rake at 11, and suddenly he’s -3. But he’s not top of the tree, because just as Southgate makes it, his playing partner Erik van Rooyen makes his fourth birdie of the day! He was very lucky that his approach didn’t topple into a greenside bunker ... but he took advantage of his break by rolling in a 15-footer. Flat-stick hotness reminiscent of Jean van de Velde in 1999 the denouement to that tournament obscures how many great putts the Frenchman made that week.Mickelson is wearing one of those travelling-salesman-style white shirts again. Buttons all the way down the front, collars and cuffs. It doesn’t look comfortable. And you thought the time he deliberately hit the moving ball at Shinnecock Hills was his biggest misjudgement of 2018. He sends his tee shot at 5 into a bunker, and while he does extremely well to smash his second towards the edge of the green, he leaves his chip well short, the ball rolling back down a ridge across the middle. It’s a bogey that drops him back to level par.“The players have had a relatively easy whack at the course so far.” So begins Chris Hainey. “Can’t wait for the wind to start picking up to make things more tricky for the players. Looking forward to seeing some random bounces and the course becoming more challenging over the next few days.” Yes, Carnoustie’s defences have been down in these benign conditions, and yet there are only nine players out there under par. It’ll be interesting to see how the later starters fare when the breeze picks up a bit. The latest to join the group at -1: Ross Fisher, with birdie at 6.Erik van Rooyen pars 9 and reaches the turn in 33. The South African debutant is certainly hot at the moment. We’ve already spoken of his tie for fourth spot at the Irish Open a fortnight ago, having led after 54 holes. What I neglected to mention was his second round at the Scottish Open last week: though he ended up missing the cut, he carded a 64 on the Friday, following up a 73, a victim of the absurdly low scoring at Gullane as much as anything else. He’s in good nick.The 2013 champ Phil Mickelson makes his first move. He sends his second at 4 straight at the flag, leaving himself a straight uphill putt from six feet for birdie. In it goes, and he joins a group at -1 now also joined by the up-and-coming Patrick Cantlay, who rolls in a delightful left-to-right putt up and over a hump from 25 feet on 5.The first email of the week, and it’s appallingly timed. “Yes Sandy! Yes Scott!! This is an absolute delight for long term Lyle-lovers!!!” writes Euan Hendrie, giddy with excitement at the great man’s confident start, and high on his morning coffee too, I’ll be bound. “The big man should walk this from here. I look forward to today and the rest of the week being a tartan procession. Yes!” And with that, it’s a three-putt bogey for Sandy on 10 he slips back to level par. Oh Euan! How could you!The reigning Japan Open champion doesn’t have much of a record in the British equivalent. Yuta Ikeda has competed on six occasions previously, missing the cut four times and never finishing higher than the tie for 38th he managed at St George’s in 2011. But he’s started well today, sending his second at 2 to a couple of feet and tidying up for his birdie. He’s -1, as is South Africa’s Shaun Norris, who finished tied for 62nd on debut at last year’s Open and has just birdied 6.Make that a one-shot lead! Because the in-form Danny Willett has just made it three birdies on the bounce, finding the par-five 6th in two big crashes and taking two careful putts. It would be a lovely story if Willett does well here this week he’s been through the mill since his shock Masters win. Meanwhile a dropped shot for Martin Kaymer at 9, the result of finding the bunker down the right of the fairway with his tee shot. He turns in 36, level par.Jhonattan Vegas is facing a race against time to make his 10.31am tee time. His entry to the country was held up due to visa issues, his flight has been delayed, and his clubs have been lost in transit. He’ll have to borrow a set if he makes it: he’s coming in from Glasgow by copter. Meanwhile van Rooyen sees a birdie putt stop on the lip at 7, but he wanders off the green smiling anyway. As you would when you’re two shots clear at the Open.Erik van Rooyen doesn’t really hit his eagle putt on 6, leaving it four feet short, the ball dying off to the left. But it would be a crime not to pick up at least a stroke after such a good second shot, and he knocks in the par putt to establish a two-shot cushion at the top of the early leaderboard. His former co-leader, Andy Sullivan, makes it back-to-back bogeys at the par-three 8th. He sent his tee shot to the left of the green, then overhit his chip across the putting surface and into a bunker. He gets up and down from the sand to limit the damage. Meanwhile news of some erstwhile Masters champions: par for Mickelson on 1, and another birdie for Willett at 5!It’s been a good year for Satoshi Kodaira so far. The 28-year-old from Tokyo won his first PGA Tour event, the RBC Heritage, pipping Kim Si-Woo in a play-off. But he’s never done well at the Open, missing the cut at Muirfield in 2013 and Troon three years later. On the 1st hole, he’s in a greenside bunker and staring at a high face. So he elects to chip out sideways ... then fluffs the shot and leaves his ball in the sand. He takes the harder route second time round, and ends up with an opening bogey. The first sandy meltdown of the week it won’t be the last. Meanwhile at 6, the first eagle of the week is carded by Matt Southgate, who curls in a big right-to-left breaker at 6. He’s -1.Andy Sullivan pays the price for a poor tee shot at 7. He sends it into the thick stuff down the right, then gets a flyer through the green with his second. A long way off the back, he can’t get up and down and slips back to -1. Meanwhile on 5, Erik van Rooyen appears to be in the zone. He whip-cracks a long iron into the heart of the green, and will have a look at eagle from 25 feet or so. All of a sudden, the South African debutant could have a little cushion at the top of the leaderboard.Thomas Pieters has unleashed the driver at the opening hole. Belt! He crashes it 393 yards, into the heart of the green, and very nearly holes the 40-footer for eagle. He taps in for an easy-as-you-like opening birdie. So continues a good week for Belgian sport. Back on the tee, Phil Mickelson plays it more conservatively by cracking an iron down the middle. And some good news for the only Englishman to win the Masters in the last two decades! Danny Willett birdies 4 to move back to level par. Willett finished in a tie for sixth at St Andrews three years ago what he’d give for a finish like that this week, to further facilitate his comeback.The first look at one of Carnoustie’s two par fives. This one, the 6th, is named after the 1953 champion Ben Hogan, and accordingly brooks no nonsense. Andy Sullivan finds sand with his tee shot and is forced to take his medicine and chip out. He’s a whisker away from making a 27-foot birdie putt, but par was always the likeliest result. Martin Kaymer hoicks his approach into deep rough to the right of the green but bumps a lovely effort to four feet. That’s a spectacular birdie given where he’d found himself. And Sandy Lyle thrashes his second to the back left of the big green, and lags his long eagle putt to kick-in distance. The great man’s in red figures again!Lyle is currently using a putter called the Ugly Duckling. He gives it a hard slap around the beak after leaving an uphill 20-footer a good five feet short. Then he pulls the short par putt, and the 1988 Masters champion slips back to level par. Sullivan meanwhile races his lengthy birdie putt ten feet past, but knocks in the return to escape with a par. He remains at -2. And what a gorgeous up-and-down for Kaymer, whose approach took a big kick right into a thick tuft: he fashions a bump through a dip and up onto the green, using a right-to-left slope to gather his ball towards the hole. He gets to 12 feet or so, which is a result from where he was. And in goes the saver. He stays at level par.So how do you tame the Beast? David Leadbetter, legendary coach of Nick Faldo, has the answers.Emiliano Grillo enjoyed his Open debut a couple of years ago at Troon. The young Argentinian finished in a tie for 12th. He’s started well this time round, clipping his second at 2 to a couple of feet, and knocking in the short birdie putt. He’s -1. Moving the other way: Martin Kaymer, who pulls a miserable short par putt left at 4 to drop back to level par. Good news for the German’s playing partners, though: Andy Sullivan’s second lands right by the flag, while Sandy Lyle spins his approach pin high to eight feet. Both of the birdie putts go in, and the 1985 champ walks off the green with a huge smile playing across his face! He’s one of five players under par right now: the 32-year-old Californian Kevin Chappell, who has a couple of high finishes at the US Open to his name, opens with a long birdie rake across 1. Erik van Rooyen has taken to this major-championship malarkey like a duck to water. Birdie at 2 to go with his opening-hole bird, after neatly tucking away the 12-footer he’d left himself, and he’s at the top of the early leaderboard. The 28-year-old South African qualified after tying for second at the Joburg Open late last year, and obviously enjoys links golf: he tied for fourth spot in the Irish Open at Ballyliffin a fortnight ago, having led the tournament after three rounds. And now look!The first bogey of this year’s tournament has been made by Danny Willett. The 2016 Masters champion was on the 1st green in regulation, but raced a long birdie effort six feet past, and pushed his par putt to the right. He trudges off in the annoyed fashion. Willett has been slowly feeling his way back to a little form, with top-ten finishes in Italy and Ireland, plus a solid showing last week in the Scottish Open at Gullane. But that’s a poor start on a course that’s defenceless right now there’s not a breath of wind.While the rough may not be at 1999 levels of hell, it doesn’t necessarily mean you want to go in it. Matthew Southgate, who finished in a tie for sixth last year at Birkdale, sent his tee shot at 1 into thick nonsense down the left, then got his club turned by the wispy grass as he wedged for the green. That sent his ball into trouble back left of the dancefloor, but he did very well to get up and down in two for his par.There’s going to be some wind coming up around midday. So these early starters will want to fill their boots. Sullivan shaves the hole at 2 with another birdie putt his partner Kaymer joins him in the very early lead at -1 after knocking his second to six feet. Another par for Sandy, who remains at level. Sullivan and Kaymer are joined at the top of an admittedly not large pile by debutant Erik van Rooyen: the South African eased his approach at 1 to a couple of feet, and finished the job as expected. That’s not a bad way to start your major-championship career.Lyle bumps a gorgeous chip from the rough to a couple of feet, and tidies up for an opening-hole par. His playing partners are the former US Open and PGA champion Martin Kaymer, somewhat out of form, and Andy Sullivan of England. Kaymer leaves himself a long birdie putt, and gets down in two. Sullivan - who finished high in Ireland recently, but missed the cut last week at Gullane - knocks his second pin high to 15 feet, and then gets a feel for the greens immediately. In goes the birdie putt, and for what it’s worth, let the record state that he’s the first leader of the 147th Open Championship!Sandy’s second into 1 isn’t too far from the pin. Unfortunately the pin’s on the right-hand edge of the green, and his ball’s in a tuft of thick stuff, just off. A word on the rough: you wouldn’t necessarily wish to be in it, but it’s not the thick, lush, nightmarish jungle of 1999. The good weather’s seen to that: it’s been burnt to a crisp and is much thinner as a result. No shaft-turning nightmares this week. OK, not so many shaft-turning nightmares this week. But that’ll inform some gung-ho tactics, no doubt, as the place isn’t so penal ... though others will be more than happy to clip irons off the tee and let the fairways, some faster than the greens, do the work, Tiger-at-Hoylake style.Good morning, Carnoustie! It’s going to be a beautiful day. It would be a beautiful day if it were forecast to lash with rain and blow up a gale ... it is the first day of the Open after all. But the conditions are special: it’ll be dry with plenty of sunshine. The honour of hitting the first shot at this year’s Championship goes to the 1985 winner Sandy Lyle, who is possibly playing in his last-ever Open: having turned 60 this year, he’ll no longer be eligible next time round. He whip-cracks an iron down the bone-dry, firm, super-fast fairways, and this year’s Open is go!It’s probably not a popular viewpoint, but here goes anyway ... Jean van de Velde did NOT bottle the 1999 Open Championship at Carnoustie. The 33-year-old French journeyman certainly made a grand balls of it, standing in the Barry Burn with his troosers rolled up, his mental mechanism having departed in the same direction as his swing ... oh he made a balls of it all right. But he did NOT bottle it. In fact, that was the whole problem. Standing on the 18th tee with a three-stroke lead, he could have nudged it up the hole carefully and conservatively, and a bogey, or even a double, would have made him only the second French major champion in history, after 1907 Open winner Arnaud Massy. But instead, he wanted to seal the deal “like d’Artagnan”. See, that takes guts. And a commitment to doing things with style. The fact he wasn’t able to see it through is neither here nor there, because sport’s not just about winning: who’ll be talking about the likes of Todd Hamilton or Ben Curtis in a hundred years’ time? Exactly. Jean van de Velde: one of golf’s swashbuckling heroes. But we are where we are, and it’s a shame that Carnoustie is nowadays synonymous with mental collapse. Sergio threw an Open away here as well, in 2007, though Padraig Harrington tried his level best to hand it him back, finding the Barry Burn twice going up the 72nd. But the thing is, some of the game’s most resilient characters have made great statements here on the Angus coast. It was at Carnoustie where Tom Watson gave lie to the accusation that he was a big-time bottler by landing the 1975 Open. It was on the 14th where Gary Player creamed a 4-wood over the Spectacle bunkers to a couple of feet in 1968, seeing off one Jack Nicklaus. And it was here where Ben Hogan, the Wee Ice Mon, arguably the greatest of all time, won the only Open he ever contested.Yes, the toughest course on the Open rota pretty much always delivers a memorable Championship, one way or another.  But who will tame The Beast this year? Defending champ Jordan Spieth isn’t in the best of form, but we’ve been here before ahead of a major with this astonishing young Texan, and it rarely seems to matter. Brooks Koepka has an absurdly good record in the majors, finishing no lower than 13th in the last seven, a run which has of course included two US Open wins. The Masters champion Patrick Reed impressed at Gullane last week and looks in the zone. The reigning PGA champ Justin Thomas has something to prove after missing the cut at Birkdale last year. Tiger is back, Phil is on his best behaviour again, Rickie Fowler is due a major, and Big Dustin is Big Dustin. These folks can do anything.But enough of the Americans: what about the Europeans? Well, Tommy Fleetwood is one of the best players in the world now, as he proved on the final day at Shinnecock Hills, and he holds the course record here: 63. Jon Rahm nearly retained his Irish Open title the other week. Justin Rose is long overdue a good Open Rory McIlroy is long overdue a major. Francesco Molinari, Russell Knox, Tyrrell Hatton and Ian Poulter are all in fine form. And then there’s Maude Sergio, back at the scene of his 2007 crime.We could go on. I’ve not even mentioned Jason Day, Henrik Stenson, Hideki Matsuyama, Marc Leishman, Louis Oosthuizen, Matt Kuchar, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Bryson DeChambeau, Ryan Fox, Scottish Open winner Brandon ‘60’ Stone, the slowly recovering Danny Willett, or Branden Grace, who broke new ground in the Open last year with his 62. There are others, too. Many others: we could be here all day. And it’s going to be a long one, so let’s get going. It’s golf’s oldest and grandest prize. It’s the 147th Open Championship. It’s on! Open fever is go! Somebody, please, call Dr Golf!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/855c3c202d2716fb12b6c057b7c5c563df019e57/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de64d9bc96db41a514e22e01cc0587b6","title":"tour de france 2018 race heads to alpe dhuez on stage 12 live","story":"129km to go: Steven Kruijswijk, currently sixth in the GC, is the leading rider in a worryinglyencouragingly (delete according to allegiance) strong breakaway group. 131km to go: The leading group, of 30-odd with occasional splintered mini-groups, is now 1min 48sec ahead of the peloton, and still pushing.132km to go: This has been a long climb already, but the summit of the Col de la Madeleine is another 10km away.134km to go: There’s a very fluid situation at the front of the race, where six riders go ahead of the leading group for a while, before another handful catch them up. BORA-hansgrohe have three riders in this leading gang.138km to go: A 28-man group has broken away, led by Barguil, Alejandro Valverde and Julian Alaphilippe. They have a 37-second lead over the peloton, with both Geraint Thomas and Chris Froome in the main pack.139km to go: The “typical Savoyard commune” (according to their website) of Bonneval-Tarentaise is passed on the climb. Look out for stone houses with wooden cladding and a lot of hanging baskets, as well as rare black grouse running in the other direction away from all the cyclists and cars and motorbikes that have suddenly invaded.The leading mini-group is packed with Movistar blue and Team Sky white. Wout Poels is not among them: we’ve already seen Team Sky’s 30-year-old Dutchman loitering at the back of the peloton. 143km to go: Barguil also failed to get away.

Shortly after Alan Bennett made his playwriting debut in 1968 with Forty Years On, Peter Nichols wrote The National Health in which a crumbling Victorian gothic ward became a metaphor for contemporary Britain. Now Bennett echoes Nichols’ device, in a play full of quiet anger under its surface charm, by using a hospital as a way of dissecting the problems with the body politic. Bennett’s setting is the geriatric ward of a Yorkshire hospital, the Bethlehem, threatened with closure. It is not, however, going down without a fight. Salter, the self-important chair of its trust, has waged a sponsored campaign to keep it alive and has a TV crew on hand to record its vitality. The patients are a cheery lot with their own choir. Even Sister Gilchrist has her own peculiar methods to ensure maximum cleanliness. But the arrival of Colin, a management consultant attached to the health ministry, suggests that the days of this kind of cradle-to-grave hospital are numbered. As so often in Bennett, plot is secondary to pungent points. One happily accepts the coincidence that Colin’s dad, a former miner, is one of the patients because of Bennett’s ability to register his rage at what our society has become. The pivotal scene is a confrontation between Salter and Colin in which the former makes the case for a hospital that serves its community, is efficiently run and even makes a profit. To Colin, the hospital’s success in meeting its targets is proof of its dispensability. “The state,” he argues, “should not be seen to work. If the state is seen to work, we shall never be rid of it.” In this richly discursive play, Bennett hits his own chosen targets. An immigrant doctor, depending on a student visa, is threatened with deportation and rebuked for his hands-on care. The hospital’s attempt to survive is tied up with publicity gimmicks and the renaming of wards after pop stars. There is even a brutal logic to Sister Gilchrist’s determination to ensure the ward has a rapid turnover. But, this being a Bennett play, there is a wealth of good jokes and a deceptive patina of nostalgia. The classic songs, arranged by George Fenton and sung by the patients, are proof of the durability of age and a poignant reminder of a lost happiness. Bennett is not above using familiar tropes: the former schoolmaster sadly awaiting a visit from a former student is straight out of Terence Rattigan’s Separate Tables. But this is a sharp, funny, subversively political play whose episodic structure is cleverly camouflaged by Nicholas Hytner as director, Bob Crowley as designer and Arlene Phillips as choreographer.In a 25-strong cast there are some fine performances. Deborah Findlay as the criminally efficient Sister, Peter Forbes as the self-aggrandising Salter, Samuel Barnett as the post-Thatcherite Colin and Sacha Dhawan as the precarious immigrant all impress. Among the patients Julia Foster as an ex-librarian, Jeff Rawle as the old miner and Simon Williams as the scholarly teacher stand out. It is also touching to note the presence of Cleo Sylvestre, who played a young nurse in The National Health, to which Bennett’s play provides an invaluable companion-piece in its ability to find in a hospital a microcosm of modern society."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ebc613058941c55aa6960bfdec7a67d5413159e/0_130_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5750259a624034f620df1482e22fabee","title":"what is the best laptop for 300 pounds","story":"Jacy wants a laptop to run Excel spreadsheets but her budget is only £300. What are the best options?What’s the best laptop for £300?I saw your article helping someone find the right laptop for under £700, which I found very useful. I also need a laptop, mainly to run Microsoft Excel. I’d like a big screen and plenty of storage for under £300. JacyIf you buy a laptop for £700 then you have to compromise on something. At £300 or less, you have to compromise on everything, and the best compromise might be to buy a refurbished laptop from a supplier such as Tier1Online, rather than a new one. See an earlier answer for more information on that idea.However, you can buy something that will do the job for that sort of money, as long as it’s a proper laptop rather than a netbook.By a “proper laptop,” I mean the sort of machine that can do much the same job as a desktop PC, but in a portable form factor. The minimum specification should include 4GB or preferably 8GB of memory and either a 320GB or larger hard drive, or a 128GB or 256GB SSD (solid-state drive). Having an SSD makes a laptop feel much more responsive.Ideally, you should be able to upgrade both memory and storage, but ultrathin laptops may be impossible to upgrade and are consequently hard to repair.Most cheap laptops nowadays are really netbooks. They are designed to use apps, web-based applications and cloud storage, much like smartphones and tablets. Indeed, many have 360-degree hinges or detachable keyboards for tablet-style use.Netbooks usually have only 2GB of memory and 32GB of eMMC chip storage, which runs at much the same speed as an SD storage card. (Again, this is typical of smartphones and tablets.) However, you can find models with 4GB and 64GB if you shop around. This is the absolute minimum you should consider.The saving grace of netbooks is that – unlike smartphones and tablets – they can run the full Microsoft Office desktop programs. These are relatively lightweight compared to resource-gobblers like Google Chrome, but it depends on the size of your Excel spreadsheets. Big, complex spreadsheets with hundreds of columns and thousands of rows can stress even powerful laptops.Intel offers two main ranges of processors for affordable laptops. The cheapest and slowest are based on the Atom design. Most Atoms are now branded as Pentium or Celeron chips, though not all Pentiums and Celerons are Atoms. Faster but more expensive chips use Intel’s Core design. Businesses normally buy laptops with Core i5 processors because they are better value than the faster Core i7 versions. For home users, entry-level Core i3 chips provide better-than-Atom performance at competitive prices.Intel typically releases new Core chips each year, and the part number shows which generation it belongs to. For example, a Core i5-5200U is a fifth generation chip, while the Core i5-6200U is from the sixth generation. Newer is better.Last year, you could find affordable laptops with fifth, sixth and even seventh-gen processors such as the Core i3-7100U. Today, they are generally beyond your budget, so you may have to settle for a Pentium or Celeron. If so, check the performance on Notebookcheck’s list of mobile processor benchmarks, or look up its PassMark score. You don’t need to understand the numbers: bigger is better.The Windows PC market is now pretty much a five-horse race. The leaders are Lenovo and HP: both sell roughly a million machines per week. Dell is third, selling mainly to businesses from its website. The consumer-oriented challengers are the Taiwanese companies, Acer and Asus. All five sell laptops manufactured in China.Given their volume sales, it’s hard to beat HP and Lenovo on price, so those are the brands I tend to end up recommending.The main compromise is the 1366 x 768-pixel non-IPS screen, but you can check that in a shop.You’d have a bigger range of options with a £350 budget, which is more closely aligned with today’s price levels. Getting below £300 will usually require either bigger compromises or bigger discounts on list prices.I’d probably still go for the Lenovo 320S because it’s well known and widely available, but it would be interesting to see the two machines side by side.Have you got a question?

She had raised $2,000 in three hours. On 27 June, when Ocasio-Cortez mentioned Bush in a tweet, she raised $8,000.“When Alex won, that changed everything,” Bush said.“First of all, it gave us a new boost and it helped to revitalize us, and then immediately that national attention came to the race.”The victory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old former Bernie Sanders surrogate, over Crowley, the 10-term Democrat who had been tipped as the next minority leader of the House, sparked a heated debate about the direction of the Democratic party. Ocasio-Cortez has since shot to national prominence, calling for single-payer healthcare, the abolishing of the immigration enforcement agency, Ice, and campaigning alongside Sanders for candidates across the country.On 21 July, Ocasio-Cortez will appear with Bush at a rally in St Louis. As Bush looks to topple Lacy Clay, who has served in the House of Representatives for 17 years, she says one of the most important things Ocasio-Cortez has done is prove it’s possible for a progressive newcomer to beat an established opponent.“By having her here, it will show people locally that this can happen here,” Bush said.“They will see that this thing wasn’t just lightning striking. This is a movement that’s happening because people are tired and they’re ready for good clean politics that just addresses people’s needs.”There’s evidence that the wave of candidates campaigning for office from the left – kicked off by Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign and buoyed by the rallies, marches and local activism that have since spread across the country – is already having an impact, driving the Democrats’ policy agenda leftward.A single-payer healthcare bill released by Sanders in the Senate in late 2017 now has the backing of a third of Senate Democrats, including several regularly touted as 2020 presidential candidates like Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker. When Sanders introduced the same bill in 2012, it had just one signature: his own.“It’s like a litmus test now for Democrats,” said Linsey Fagan. She’s running for Congress in Texas against Republican Michael Burgess, who has served since 2003.Despite running in a deeply red district, Fagan, a single mother who points to her help from government programs like Women, Infants and Candidates, which provides supplemental food and healthcare to low-income mothers as well as grants for students, said she had received support from some Trump voters.“When I talk to conservatives in my district, a lot of them will say they voted for something different, and when they voted for Trump they voted for change,” Fagan said.“But they got the wrong sort of change. They want change that’s positive and unifying.”Fagan, Bush and Ocasio-Cortez know each other well. Each is supported by Brand New Congress, a progressive organization that endorses and provides administrative support to political hopefuls who run on Sanders-esque platforms. The group hosts knowledge-sharing events among candidates, each of whom pledges not to accept corporate backing, and it hopes to elect progressives to US office from across the country.“It is not to be viewed as something that stands for anything else,” Pelosi said.Several progressive candidates have faced resistance from established Democrats. Alessandra Biaggi, running in the Democratic primary for a Bronx seat in the New York state senate, said she had been repeatedly told to pipe down.“I’ve been told: ‘It’s not really the time to be running against the Democrats,’” said Biaggi, who is running against Jeff Klein, who until recently led New York’s Independent Democratic Conference: a group of Democrats who voted with Republicans.“And what they meant was: ‘How dare you? Who do you think you are running against someone who is one of the political bosses in New York?’” Biaggi said.“Because I’m a first time candidate and he has basically earned his stripes.”Faced with resistance from the party establishment, some on the left have called for a third party to be formed. In 2017, a group of activists launched a bid to “Draft Bernie for a People’s Party” which aimed to “channel the enthusiasm generated by the Sanders campaign into building a new political party”, although the move failed to catch on . That was a good thing, said Sam Rosenfeld, assistant professor of political science at Colgate University and author of The Polarizers: Postwar Architects of Our Partisan Era, because the best way for the left to change the Democratic party was from the inside.“There’s a robust history of that kind of activism and that kind of dissatisfaction with the party establishment elites in the Democratic party that has led to meaningful change over time,” Rosenfeld said.He pointed to how northern, liberal Democrats had managed to change the party in the 1960s, eventually disempowering, and alienating, the white southern “Dixiecrat” voters and laying the path for the Democratic party to become more liberal than the Republicans.The way Ocasio-Cortez and other members of Congress could start to move the party was to form a voting bloc which could threaten to vote against Democratic proposals unless it got progressive concessions, Rosenfeld said. “Generally speaking, working within existing political institutions in the American system has very permeable influence of all parties. And so for ideological activists, there’s a lot of room for success if you stay engaged within those parties.”It’s been proven to work on the opposite side of the aisle. The Tea Party-inspired Freedom Caucus, a Republican voting bloc, managed to derail Trump’s American Health Care Act in 2017, arguing it didn’t cut enough from Obama’s Affordable Care Act. It offers hope for the left to effect their own agenda.“We wholeheartedly believe in what we say and people are realizing that we’re speaking to them,” said Cori Bush, who will face Clay in Missouri on 7 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d89968f3f82d0f79ce07294fd77e71a7ed93a2f/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bc588a34a06000ac3c669214b6335c8","title":"turkeys state of emergency ends but crackdown continues","story":"Laws enacted after 2016 coup attempt are lifted, but Recep Tayyip Erdoğan appears determined to continue pursuit of opponents Turkey’s two-year state of emergency came to an end at midnight on Wednesday, but as trials of dissidents and journalists continue human rights campaigners have said Ankara must do more to reverse a “suffocating” crackdown on free speech.Critics say the state of emergency, in place since a failed coup attempt in July 2016 that killed 250 people and wounded 1,400, has been used to detain opponents of the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and his government for lengthy periods without trial and to intimidate dissidents and prosecute media outlets. More than 120,000 people in the police, military, academia, media and civil service have been detained or dismissed from their jobs over their alleged links to Fethullah Gülen, an exiled preacher based in the US whose supporters Ankara blames for the coup. “Over the last two years, Turkey has been radically transformed with emergency measures used to consolidate draconian powers, silence critical voices and strip away basic rights,” said Fotis Filippou, Amnesty International’s deputy director for Europe. “The lifting of the state of emergency alone will not reverse this crackdown. What is needed is systematic action to restore respect for human rights, allow civil society to flourish again and lift the suffocating climate of fear that has engulfed the country.”Turkey’s government has said it will not seek a renewal of the state of emergency, allowing it to lapse two years after it was imposed and days after Erdoğan was sworn in as president for a fresh five-year term with extraordinary new powers narrowly approved in a referendum last year.Critics say the use of the emergency powers went beyond Gülenists linked to the coup. About a quarter of Turkey’s judges have either been dismissed or detained, a vast realignment of the judiciary that has prompted outrage and concerns that it is no longer independent.Thousands have been tried, with many sentenced to life, for involvement in the coup and 100 people have been extradited to Turkey at the behest of the country’s intelligence service, the MİT. The crackdown has also increased tensions with western allies such as the EU and the US. On Wednesday a court in the city of İzmir ruled for the continued detention of Andrew Brunson, an American pastor accused of having Gülenist links, in a move that could prompt congressional sanction and that was described by an official at the US Commission on International Religious Freedom as a “mockery of justice”.Erdoğan’s ruling Justice and Development (AK) party has tabled a controversial anti-terrorism bill that will retain some of the state of emergency measures. One provision allows local governors to impose curfews or make some areas off-limits to the public, making it easier to ban demonstrations.The government also appears determined to continue its prosecutions of journalists and opponents.Turkey is the world’s biggest jailer of journalists, ahead of China and Egypt, with more than 120 imprisoned since the coup attempt. Cumhuriyet journalists have been prosecuted in numerous court cases, with some, including the current editor-in-chief, appealing against convictions of up to seven-and-a-half years in jail. Erdoğan’s son-in-law and finance minister, Berat Albayrak, is also suing the journalists because of their reporting on offshore investments listed in the Paradise Papers, a move that the advocacy group Reporters Without Borders condemned as threatening the survival of independent media outlets reporting on corruption.“Independent media outlets are fewer now than the fingers on one hand,” said Ünker. “Journalism is our job so we have to do it in all conditions, even in the face of such duress and injustice.” But the crackdown appeared to have barely slowed even as the end of the state of emergency approached. A day before Erdoğan was sworn in, another 18,600 public servants were dismissed over alleged links to terror groups, and on Tuesday academics who had signed a petition calling for a peaceful resolution of the conflict with Kurdish separatists were sentenced to prison. Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, the leader of the largest opposition bloc, the Republican People’s party (CHP), vowed in a party congress to challenge what he described as a “dictatorship” and one-man rule. But on Wednesday the government said it was launching an investigation against Kılıçdaroğlu for insulting the president, an allegation frequently used to intimidate critics, over a cartoon mocking the Turkish president that was shared on social media.The continued prosecutions offer a hint that, even though Erdoğan is secure in his control of the state’s levers of power and authority, there will be little immediate relief for dissidents.“I think state of emergency has served its purpose, both politically and practically,” said Selim Can Sazak, a Turkey expert and adjunct fellow at the Century Foundation. “The job is almost complete. Hundreds of thousands purged. Some Gülenists, apparently, but many others not. Universities, bureaucracy, media, etc, largely subdued.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f995caa7188ccf658266e2ec9e6f68a92beb9fd/0_353_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aac83c8816a168bc2681f0c4215bb2d4","title":"too long to fit launch of new spanish sub runs aground","story":"Spain is having to expand its submarine base as £900m vessel is too big for dockFirst it was too heavy, then it was too long. Either way Spain’s expensive attempt to modernise its submarine fleet has gone awry – and left Russian diplomats amused.The Spanish navy has now been forced to dredge and expand its main submarine base to accommodate the latest version of its S-80 Plus flagship vessel. Problems with the submarine first became apparent in 2013 when it was discovered it would be too heavy to float, necessitating a redesign to make it lighter and spread the weight over an extra 10 metres.But that means the vessel is now too long to fit into the submarine dock in the Spanish naval base in Cartagena, south-east Spain. The cost of the infrastructure works needed to adapt the dock to the submarines are estimated at €16m (£14m).The Spanish government will approve in the next few days raising the total additional cost of the new submarine by €17m and taking the total cost to roughly €1bn for each of the four submersibles, practically twice what was initially forecast. Reading a report of Spain’s submarine problems, Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia’s deputy ambassador at the UN, tweeted, “an interesting chain of miscalculations. Never imagined this could be possible in a modern navy”.Spain’s new socialist government has decided to seek the extra funding rather than see the whole project grind to a halt in the autumn. Margarita Robles, the new defence minister, however admitted there had been deficiencies in the project.The submarine’s construction was first envisaged in 1999 but it was almost 15 years before problems became apparent with its weight . A Spanish official told the Associated Press at the time that someone had put a decimal point in the wrong place, and “nobody paid attention to review the calculations”. That mistake cost a reported €14m while engineers and consultants figured out that buoyancy could be improved by lengthening the boat.Reports in Spain say the biggest uncertainty that continues to weigh on the project is its non-nuclear independent air propulsion system (AIP), which could keep the submarine underwater for as long as two weeks. The Spanish Ministry of Defence has opted for a system capable of producing hydrogen from bioethanol and has commissioned its development to two Spanish firms, Técnicas Reunidas and Abengoa. Military sources have assured the Spanish newspaper El Pais that, after some sound failure, the milestones are being met.To avoid further delays, it has been foreseen that the AIP will be integrated from the third submersible (the S-83, whose delivery to the navy is scheduled for March 2026), while the first two (with a delivery date of 2022 and 2024) will begin to navigate with diesel propulsion and will incorporate the AIP when the first overhaul is done at the end of the decade.• This article was amended on 19 July 2018 because an earlier version said in the next few days the Spanish government would approve raising the total additional cost of the new submarine by €1.7m. This has been corrected to €17m."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d03d1c31df7eb3b37cf00417ac09a201a80d6c75/0_627_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04ebf8d338ecf43302e41ce22ed8ce04","title":"work less get more new zealand firms four day week an unmitigated success","story":"Two-hundred-and-forty staff at Perpetual , a company which manages trusts, wills and estate planning, trialled a four-day working week over March and April, working four, eight-hour days but getting paid for five.Academics studied the trial before, during and after its implementation, collecting qualitative and quantitative data.Perpetual  founder Andrew Barnes came up with the idea in an attempt to give his employees better work-life balance, and help them focus on the business while in the office on company time, and manage life and home commitments on their extra day off.Jarrod Haar, professor of human resource management at Auckland University of Technology, found job and life satisfaction increased on all levels across the home and work front, with employees performing better in their jobs and enjoying them more than before the experiment. Helen Delaney, a senior lecturer at the University of Auckland Business School, said employees’ motivation and commitment to work increased because they were included in the planning of the experiment, and played a key role in designing how the four-day week would be managed so as not to negatively impact productivity.“Employees designed a number of innovations and initiatives to work in a more productive and efficient manner, from automating manual processes to reducing or eliminating non-work-related internet usage,” said Delaney.Andrew Barnes said he would take the results of the trial to the board to open up a discussion on how a four-day work week could be implemented long-term in his company.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the “If you can have parents spending more time with their children, how is that a bad thing?” asked Barnes, who believes the new work model has the potential to profoundly impact society for the better.“Are you likely to get fewer mental health issues when you have more time to take care of yourself and your personal interests? Probably ... if you have fewer people in the office at any one time, can we make smaller offices?”New Zealand’s workplace relations minister, Iain Lees-Galloway, said the results of the trial were “very interesting” and he was keen to encourage businesses to trial new and improved work models. “I’m really keen to work with any businesses that are looking at how they can be more flexible for their staff and how they can look to improve productivity whilst working alongside their staff and protecting terms and conditions,” Less-Galloway said."},{"url":null,"title":"it s a huge find megalithic passage tomb discovered in co meath","story":"  July 16, 2018Archaeologists uncover burial chambers on historic Br\u0026uacute na B\u0026oacuteinne heritage site   July 19, 2018Department warned against changes to house built above 5,000-year-old tomb "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3278331.1509668378!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ask facebook to leave ireland if it won t control content","story":"Inside Facebook: Secrets of the Social Network uncovers the policies of Facebook’s content review department, based in Dublin. Video: Channel 4\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFacebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Silicon Valley, California.  Facebook has confirmed it plans to create hundreds of new jobs in Ireland next year. Photograph: Facebook Forensic cyberpsychologist Dr Mary Aiken says the Government should consider asking Facebook to leave Ireland if it does not take measures to control content.She told RTÉ’s Today radio programme that if the Government was prepared to “throw children under the bus” in return for keeping 2,000 Facebook jobs in Ireland, “then shame on us, shame on the Government.”Dr Aiken made the comments following revelations about serious shortcomings in Facebook’s approach to violent and abusive material on its site.These were revealed in a Channel 4 Dispatches investigation, broadcast on Tuesday, which showed trainee moderators at Facebook’s Dublin offices being told to leave disturbing content online.Among the material was a video of a sobbing infant being kicked and beaten by a man. An image suggesting a girl whose “first crush is a little negro boy” should have her head held under water was also left on the site despite complaints.In response, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the Government is willing to consider introducing significant fines for online companies, such as Facebook that fail to “uphold basic standards of decency”.Mr Varadkar – who last week said he believed technology companies were attuned to child safety issues – said it appeared Facebook had not lived up to its own “community standards”.Given the size of companies such as Facebook, Mr Varadkar said any fines would have to be “commensurate” and be large enough to “ hit the profits of the company and cause them to change their behaviour.”“Facebook has community standards and we expect them to uphold their own standards. The evidence produced by Dispatches is that they haven’t on all occasions. That would represent, in my view, a failure of self-regulation,” he said.However Dr Aiken said that expecting social media companies to self-regulate was akin to expecting drink drivers to self-regulate and award themselves penalty points.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg was like a petulant boy who was contrite when chastised, she said, but being contrite was not enough.She called on the Government to set up a commission to investigate the issues regarding content control as highlighted in the Channel 4 programme.There is no technology that can keep up with real time content, she said. Facebook has 2.9billion active users which results in “a big data problem”.It is impossible to moderate or keep up with that amount of content, “this is the elephant in the cyber room,” she said.She also said it was not possible to legislate for people’s behaviour and this was why she had opposed the digital age of consent of 13. “You cannot outsource parenting,” she said.Minister for Communications Denis Naughten will meet Facebook representatives in New York on Thursday.Speaking from the US on Wednesday the Minister said he was aware the company had failed to meet the standards expected by the public.“The programme raises serious questions for the company in respect of the manner in which it handles reports of harmful or illegal content the internal procedures it has in place to moderate harmful or illegal content, and, the systems the company has in place to report instances of abuse, suspected abuse or other illegal activity to the appropriate authorities, including An Garda Síochána,” he said.On the same programme Labour TD Sean Sherlock called on Mr Naughten to immediately appoint a digital safety commissioner saying there is a need to regulate “that space”.He warned that the message had gone out to the world from the Channel 4 programme that “Ireland is a safe space for this kind of content.”Mr Sherlock said he believed now is the time for such regulation. “We need laws that are robust for these companies if they are operating on Irish soil.“I don’t think we should kick them out, but we need stronger laws. There has to be legislation for behaviour. If there is legislation for the online space that will change behaviour.”The Children’s Rights Alliance, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and CyberSafe Ireland all said the programme underlined the need for legislation to regulate internet service providers, saying self-regulation was insufficient.Facebook’s public policy manager of content, Siobhán Cummiskey, said yesterday she knew people were “upset and concerned” by the revelations, adding the company had taken “immediate steps” to address the issues raised."},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Opponents say legislation marginalises country\u0026rsquos Arab minorityGovernment buildings and political party offices attacked as unrest grows across southUS has conceded key Russian demands but Trump has not recommitted to troop pullout\u0026lsquoBreaking the Silence\u0026rsquo Act opponents claim it attacks free speech, rights groups and NGOsWorst violence since 2014 war sees Israeli airstrikes and militant rocket strikes across borderTwo Palestinian teens killed amid escalation in conflict between Israel and HamasPutin and Trump to discuss Syria at summit, as Kurds seek to make deal with DamascusIsrael\u0026rsquos defence minister suggests closing down Dublin embassy but such a drastic move is unlikelyBill aims to preserve \u0026lsquoJewish character\u0026rsquo of state and allows Jewish-only communitiesMove a powerful symbol heralding defeat of rebellion that aimed to unseat AssadKingdom already hosts 1.3m Syrians fleeing war, straining country\u0026rsquos slim resourcesMaedeh Hojabri (19) was arrested for dancing in her bedroom and posting clips on social mediaActivists in Gaza vow to continue launching incendiary kites across borderAttack on airbase coincided with a Syrian army victory over insurgents in the southYad Vashem rejects idea of \u0026lsquoheroic acts\u0026rsquo by many Poles who \u0026lsquorisked lives\u0026rsquo to save JewsIsrael planned to demolish Khan al-Ahmar and transfer 181 residents to toxic landfillGonen Segev accused of supplying Tehran data on Israel\u0026rsquos energy and security networkOver 2,000 foreign women and children are being held in camps, trapped in a legal limbo\u0026lsquoRelentless conflict in Yemen has pushed a country on the brink deep into the abyss\u0026rsquoAid groups issue urgent appeals for people stranded in desert as surrender talks continue"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

There\u0027s enough regulation in Australia without having to stop things because of perceived danger.A proposal to ban surfing on most of Australia\u0026#39s iconic Bondi Beach has triggered anger among the local boarding communityThe council has been conducting the survey as part of a review of beach safety. Fibreglass boards are already banned at the southern end but the survey asked locals for their views on removing all boards with fins, including those made from foam. The local mayor,  John Wakefield, said the council conducted the survey because “large numbers of people” had complained about the use of foam boards between the red-and-yellow flags, which denote an area safe for swimming. Soft boards are no longer as soft as they were and there\u0027s been a number of residents and users of the beach who have expressed concerns about safety,” he said.  But Mr Wakefield insisted there was no current plan for a ban.“The issue is becoming a little bit overblown, he said. “No policy has been devised. No proposal has been received.There\u0027s a survey asking questions about what people perceive to be problems and potential solutions.Surfing organisations said that a ban would end the traditional progress of surfers at Bondi, who often start on foam boards at the safer northern end and then shift to using fibreglass boards at the southern end.“The southern end of the beach is the most dangerous end, it has the biggest waves and it has more rips,” Bondi Board Riders president Ian Wallace told ABC News.You\u0027re going to put everyone down in that one end and then you\u0027re going to throw your learners in there, your kids in there … it just can\u0027t work.The North Bondi Surf Life Saving Club said in a message to members that it opposed the move.Our primary objective is to ensure the swimming and surfing public are safe, however, this plan is not going to do that and stands the chance of actually making it far more dangerous, it said.    Please review our commenting policyRescued Thai football boys pray at Buddhist temple as they begin first day back homeIsrael passes isive law declaring only Jews have right to \u0026#39national self-determination\u0026#39Jeff Bezos\u0026#39 Blue Origin rocket company launches booster and capsule higher than they ever have beforeBurberry sets fire to £28million of its products to stop \u0026#39wrong people\u0026#39 wearing their clothes, sources claimUS couple wins damages from Florida mayor threatening to seize home painted in style of Van GoghSouth Korea’s equality minister \u0026#39should prepare for legal action\u0026#39 after accusing folk tale hero of raping fairyBrussels warns EU countries: get ready for a no-deal Brexit Knife crime and murder soar, new figures revealWho is Maria Butina, the gun activist and student charged in US with spying for Russia?Trump questions if US should defend \u0026#39aggressive\u0026#39 Montenegro in blow to key Nato principleBoris Johnson\u0026#39s resignation speech in full: \u0026#39It\u0026#39s not too late to save Brexit\u0026#39Australian PM urges Pope to sack archbishop convicted of concealing child sex abuseNovichok poisoning: Skripal attack  suspects \u0026#39identified on CCTV as several Russians\u0026#39UK set to be overtaken by Australia in attracting international studentsComment: We can treat Aids with medicine – but only love will beat its insidious stigmaHS2 \u0026#39to be as punctual as Japan\u0026#39s bullet trains\u0026#39North Korea has most modern-day slaves in the world, report reveals, as rights abuses laid bareBaroness Newlove: Reform \u0026#39derisory\u0026#39 victims of crime compensation schemeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/19/TELEMMGLPICT000169773999_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqe5jTtuvhyhg4PHi86V8a0uHC4uooAYptTLzL00kNATY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"south koreas equality minister should prepare legal action accusing","story":"Chung Hyun-back was applauded by feminists but ridiculed by a former judgeSouth Korea’s minister of gender equality is under fire after describing the hero of a much-loved traditional folktale as a kidnapper and a rapist who took advantage of a fairy. Speaking at a recent seminar, Chung Hyun-back took issue with the elderly woodcutter in the popular Korean fable “The Woodcutter and the Fairy” for stealing a nymph’s dress while she bathed in a pond.The woodcutter took her clothes so she could not go back to heaven. He then married her and had two children. He then gave the fairy some clothing and she flew back to the skies to be with her parents. The innocent tale is one of the most famous fables in South Korea and one that all children will hear at school or bedtime.“When I was in elementary school, I took great pity on the woodcutter - but seen from the point of view of the fairy, the two children she had with him and the fairy’s parents, he could be considered a kidnapper and a rapist”, she said. “This should be changed in the context of achieving gender equality”, Ms Chung said. The minister’s accusations were applauded by feminists, The Korea Times reported, but ridiculed by a former judge. Hwang Ju-myung, now chairman of the Seoul-based legal firm HMP Law, told the newspaper that according to Ms Chung’s logic, she should prepare for a legal challenge from the woodcutter.“Besides, it is silly to accuse a character from an ancient story of such a heinous crime”, he said. “As far as the law is concerned, it is hard to find any indication in the story that the woodcutter resorted to coercion to have sex with the fairy or to force her to live with him”. Mr Hwang conceded that stealing the fairy’s clothes would be a breach of the law, but added: “Theft is a crime that is can be investigated and punished, but in the story it is not detected by any law enforcement officials and no investigation is conducted.”He added that it is “frivolous” to turn a folk tale on its head in order to make the plot or the actions of fictitious characters contravene modern day morals or law.“In this case, the minister should brace for a libel suit from the woodcutter”, he said.South Korea has experienced a wave of feminism and the #MeToo movement in the last six months. The campaign took off in January, when Seo Ji-hyeon, a prosecutor, accused a senior official from the Ministry of Justice of groping her at a funeral when he was drunk. It has since swept up numerous public figures, including politicians, actors and Ko Un, a poet who has been tipped for the Nobel Prize for Literature.  Please review our commenting policyRescued Thai football boys pray at Buddhist temple as they begin first day back homeIsrael passes isive law declaring only Jews have right to \u0026#39national self-determination\u0026#39Jeff Bezos\u0026#39 Blue Origin rocket company launches booster and capsule higher than they ever have beforeBurberry sets fire to £28million of its products to stop \u0026#39wrong people\u0026#39 wearing their clothes, sources claimUS couple wins damages from Florida mayor threatening to seize home painted in style of Van GoghBrussels warns EU countries: get ready for a no-deal Brexit Knife crime and murder soar, new figures revealWho is Maria Butina, the gun activist and student charged in US with spying for Russia?Trump questions if US should defend \u0026#39aggressive\u0026#39 Montenegro in blow to key Nato principleBoris Johnson\u0026#39s resignation speech in full: \u0026#39It\u0026#39s not too late to save Brexit\u0026#39Australian PM urges Pope to sack archbishop convicted of concealing child sex abuseNovichok poisoning: Skripal attack  suspects \u0026#39identified on CCTV as several Russians\u0026#39UK set to be overtaken by Australia in attracting international studentsComment: We can treat Aids with medicine – but only love will beat its insidious stigmaHS2 \u0026#39to be as punctual as Japan\u0026#39s bullet trains\u0026#39Baroness Newlove: Reform \u0026#39derisory\u0026#39 victims of crime compensation schemeSex education to be compulsory in all primary and secondary schoolsNorth Korea has most modern-day slaves in the world, report reveals, as rights abuses laid bareWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/07/15/993342290.jpg","title":"pound sterling latest retail sales june bank of england interest rates","story":"Created with Sketch.City of London analysts had expected sales to grow by 0.2 per cent in the month, building on the 1.3 per cent surge in May, but instead they fell by 0.5 per centClick to followThe Independent Online\u0027Consumers stayed away from stores and instead enjoyed the World Cup and the heatwave,\u0027 said the ONSRetail sales unexpectedly slumped in June, causing the value of sterling to dip below $1.30 for the first time since last September.City of London analysts had expected sales volumes to grow by 0.2 per cent in the month, building on the 1.3 per cent surge in May when the royal wedding boosted consumption.Instead, they\u0026nbspfell by 0.5 per cent, the Office for National Statistics reported on Thursday.Royal wedding spending splurge unexpectedly boosts retail sales in MayUK retail sales bounce back by more than expected in April, new figureUK retail sales decline as consumers struggle with austerityMarch snow responsible for biggest drop in UK retail sales in a yearThe ONS said that “consumers stayed away\u0026nbspfrom stores and instead enjoyed the World Cup and the heatwave”.Sterling was trading at $1.2995 in the wake of the data, down 0.54 per cent on the day.Financial markets took the weak figures as another reason why the Bank of England may not, despite previous\u0026nbspexpectations, raise interest rates at its next meeting on 2 August.“There’s little disguising the fact that this is a weak data point, with retail sales dropping despite the good weather and England’s world cup heroics,” said David Cheetham of the online trading company XTB.“Up until just two days ago an August hike from the Bank of England had looked probable but the combination of lower than expected inflation and soft consumer spending, despite a favourable backdrop have certainly given Governor Carney and his fellow rate-setters some food for thought.”Earlier this week the ONS reported that consumer price inflation in June was steady at 2.4 per cent, despite City predictions that it would be pushed higher by rising fuel prices.Against the dollar, sterling is currently trading at its weakest levels\u0026nbspin 10 months.Despite the retail sales weakness in June, over the three months volumes were up 2.1 per cent, the strongest quarterly rise since February 2015.“While this week’s unexpectedly-weak inflation figures have made the outlook for an interest rate rise in August rather less clear-cut, the recovery in the consumer sector supports our view that a hike is still more likely than not.”UK GDP growth in the first quarter of 2018 was just 0.2 per cent, depressed by the Beast from the East snowstorms.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The nature of our future trading relationship with the European Union straddles so many Tory totems from the role of business to the European Court of Justice to the border with Ireland. As a consequence an internal party “deal”\u0026nbspthat took two years to put together fell apart within two days and now we are once more the laughing stock of Europe with only a matter of months before we leave.Reforging 40 years of economic, political and societal links in a constructive, inclusive and forward-looking way would be a challenge for any government but is clearly far beyond the capacity of this one. As a government in waiting, it is Labour’s job not only to hold the government to account but to set out what our approach would be. This is the work that Keir Starmer and Labour’s Brexit team has undertaken, exemplified by the amendments our party tabled to the Great Repeal Bill. But it is also my job as shadow minister for industrial strategy to consider what Brexit means for our economic future and to place decisions in that context. And that has to mean an economic future that\u0026nbspincludes everyone, and does not merely carry over the regional and social ides that helped deliver the referendum result in the first place.To achieve this we need to look back even as we look forward. And to look outwards to the world even as we consider how best to maintain a close relationship with the European Union.The industrial landscape of Britain today is the product of a succession of industrial strategies or non-strategies, each of which was ultimately unable to deal with the reality of the larger world economy. Britain entered the 20th century hoping to maintain its position as the supplier of manufactured goods to the largest empire the world had ever known, a strategy that could not be sustained given the scale of US industry and the understandable desire of the rest of the Empire to build its own industrial base. By the 1960s, British industry was increasingly focused on our domestic market, but even that more limited “strategy”\u0026nbspproved untenable in the face of more efficient and larger scale foreign competition from the United States, Japan, Germany, Korea\u0026nbspand ultimately China.In response, the Tories under Margaret Thatcher and her successors, and to a lesser extent the 1997 Labour government, pursued a kind of “anti-industrial strategy”. This substituted first North Sea oil and then City of London financial services for industrial competitiveness. North Sea oil was a finite national asset that delivered the expected temporary economic boost. The impact of our burgeoning financial sector was more complex. It brought substantial benefits in jobs, revenues and social capital, particularly to London. It also drove the “financialisation”\u0026nbspof our economy.Financialisation\u0026nbsp– the anti-industrial strategy The way in which financialisation proved to be an anti-industrial strategy is admirably set out in leading economist Mariana Mazzucato’s new book The Value of Everything. In it she describes the “two faces of financialisation”.The first of these is the way in which the financial sector has stopped resourcing the real economy – instead of investing in companies that produce “stuff”, finance is financing finance. Why lend money to a manufacturer that may fail when you can make a bet on some options hedged with other options that virtually guarantee a return in a few weeks? The owner of a medium-sized manufacturing business gave me a striking example of this recently. His high-street bank was initially supportive when he requested a loan for new manufacturing equipment, which would significantly boost productivity. Once the bank realised that the equipment would not be something they could sell on should he go bankrupt, their interest drained away entirely. It was willing to lend based on liquidation value, but was not willing to take a risk on a living business. In a financialised economy, capital tends to flow towards standardised securities rather than actual operating businesses that present bespoke risks.But it is not only financial capital that is erted from the real economy. Human capital is sucked in too. When I graduated from Imperial College in 1987, I would estimate that only about 10 per cent of my electrical engineering cohort went into industry. The majority went into management consultancy and finance, which paid better as well as having clearer career paths. Recently the dean of an engineering department told me that was still the case and asked how I could expect engineers to go into engineering when finance paid so much better and was quite honestly the only way a graduate engineer could ever hope to buy a home in London.I responded that they should come to Newcastle where not only could they buy a lovely home on an engineer’s salary, but also be within a few minutes of some of the most beautiful countryside in the world and at the heart of a concentration of culture that rivals far bigger cities. I recognise the dean’s point – with so much financial engineering demanding money and people, real engineering doesn’t stand a chance. But it is real engineering that drives industrial productivity.Financialisation is not just a problem because it drains resources away from industry. In a financialised economy, investors with short-term horizons tend to have more control over firms. This results in less reinvestment of profits and rising burdens of debt that, in a vicious cycle, makes industry even more driven by short-term considerations. In effect, this kind of finance is not neutral but changes the nature of what it finances.This was seen just recently with the GKN takeover by “turnaround company”\u0026nbspMelrose. An estimated 20 to 25 per cent of the shares in GKN were in the hands of hedge funds, many of which were expected to back the takeover – with the firm Elliott Advisors, owning 3.8 per cent\u0026nbspof the company, explicitly doing so. The bid was won by 52 per cent to 48 per cent. And Melrose itself is not run in any long-term interest other than maximising shareholder value: it has a long history of operating as a “turnaround firm” and almost a third of its own shares are held by hedge funds. The vote was essentially a referendum about the time horizons of British industry, and Britain lost.So when bankers and chancellors talk of having learned\u0026nbspthe lessons of the financial crisis they are wrong both at the macro and micro level. With UK national debt twice what it was in 2007 and household debt to disposable income at a record high, 10 years after the crash of\u0026nbspthe global economy, finance is once again at the heart of an existential threat to our way of life.Financialisation and inequality Even before the crash, this “anti-industrial strategy”\u0026nbspdrove social and geographic inequalities. Levels of income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient reached a pre-crash peak of 0.35 in the 1990s and, while improving slightly, remained high in comparison to the Sixties throughout the 2000s. Regional inequality was also a significant feature of the pre-crash economy, with data from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research showing a gradual rise throughout the 2000s in the difference in gross household income between regions. In 2005, average household income in the North East was 14 per cent below the UK average, while in London it was 20 per cent higher.Gini Coefficient 1961-2016 – 1 is the most unequal score, 0 is the most equal\u0026nbsp(Institute for Fiscal Studies)The Tories were either indifferent to these inequalities or at best felt they were an acceptable price to pay. Labour, under previous leaderships, believed that redistributive policies could make it all come out right in the end, and flagship programmes such as Sure Start and working tax credits certainly helped. But both approaches were fundamentally mistaken. Financialisation turned out to be a house built on sand – unable to generate enough wealth to compensate for the abandonment of the rest of the economy, and vulnerable to boom and bust cycles. Ultimately, the financial crisis of 2008 and the global economic crisis it spawned showed that the ideology of finance – that financial markets and institutions, left to themselves and the profit motive, would efficiently allocate capital – was a pernicious fantasy.British industry—creating real value in the real economyBut that was not the whole story. While\u0026nbspmetropolitan London came to comprise 40 per cent\u0026nbspof the British economy – and a 40 per cent\u0026nbspheavily dependent on finance and professional services – something else was happening in the rest of the country. Britain’s entry into the European Union, and the survival in parts of Britain of a culture favourable to engineering and manufacturing, fostered the growth of certain sectors of British industry as part of a larger integrated European industrial base. The supply chains of large European firms such as Airbus, Boeing and BMW are substantially British. Nissan’s Sunderland plant is the final destination for parts manufactured across Europe and produces more cars per worker than any other factory in the European Union. And GKN, itself one of the world’s oldest engineering firms, is a key supplier to international aerospace and automotive firms – including European giant Airbus, which warned against the Melrose takeover. Factories engaged in producing components and sub-assemblies and assembling components from elsewhere in Europe are now critical to the prosperity of much of Britain. Figure 1 shows just one of BMW’s many supply chains.Such integration requires frictionless borders but also agreed standards to define everything from the acceptable frequency of electromagnetic radiation to the atomic composition of a given chemical. Leaving the European Union will not mean less regulation simply more duplication. As they scramble to recreate existing EU agencies and regulations, businesses and government departments are realising that far from Brussels bureaucracy being imposed upon Britain, the European Union was effectively based on the “shared back office services”\u0026nbspmodel that Whitehall now champions for local government.In many ways, British agriculture has followed a similar trajectory to British car manufacturing, where British farmers have been able to successfully compete on both quality and price in markets defined by EU food safety rules. For example, British farmers export far more wheat flour to the EU – approximately 250,000 tonnes last year – than they do to non-EU countries – approximately 6,000 tonnes. The same goes for other agricultural products such as barley (one\u0026nbspmillion tonnes versus 50,000 tonnes) and oats (16,000 tonnes versus 4,000 tonnes).The EU is the largest importer and exporter of food in the world. As an EU member state, our farmers have benefited from preferential access to this market through exemptions from the tariffs and quotas imposed on non-member countries. And with 85 per cent of seasonal agricultural workers in the UK coming from Bulgaria and Romania, agriculture is one of the UK sectors most heavily dependent on freedom of movement.Food and drink is Britain’s largest manufacturing sector and Europe’s complex rules of origin guidelines could lead to a “hidden hard Brexit”\u0026nbsprequiring the restructuring of food manufacturing supply chains even if we secure preferential access.\u0026nbspAgriculture and manufacturing are both more important outside of London and particularly around the very market towns that have been most “left behind” by the new economy.As Britain contemplates how to engage with the world before, during and after Brexit, we need to understand the trade policy choices we make will drive the shape of our economy and are therefore also industrial policy choices, choices that will shape the very nature of what work we do, the health of our communities\u0026nbspand the way we live for decades to come.  The benefits of a customs union The Labour Party is united in supporting a customs union with Europe. We believe it will bolster our current industrial strengths and offer the possibility of continued industrial revival in certain sectors. We should not be complacent about this approach. Our place in the larger European manufacturing economy will still depend on our ability to innovate and to invest, so that British firms successfully manage and not just participate in supply chains. And this will depend on our learning the lessons of the financial crisis so that our financial markets and institutions actually invest in productive sectors.Unfortunately, the government continues to act as if the only issues in financial regulation are safety, soundness and fraud. While these are obviously important issues, they completely miss the question of whether our financial system is effectively channelling capital to productive and innovative investment. And this is the whole point of a financial system. A financial system that simply parks money in risk-free assets or honestly gambles on sporting events, would meet the characteristics the Tories have established but would still be a total failure. As Mazzucato argues, the traditional policies we have seen create a “healthy financial sector (bailed out, ring-fenced, and restructured) in a deeply sick economy”.Implications for industrial strategy of the alternativesLast week’s visit by President Trump to Britain revealed that he thinks the UK-US relationship is “the highest level of special”. Arch Brexiteers argue that he offers an alternative to a customs union with Europe: a free trade agreement with the United States, which, as a consequence of Nafta\u0026nbspwould really be a free trade agreement with all of North America. But while\u0026nbspthe US economy is of comparable size to the EU in GDP terms, $19 trillion (£14 trillion)\u0026nbspcompared to $17 trillion, they have different sectoral compositions and regulatory standards. Going in this direction would lead to substantial changes in the structure of the British economy.Earlier this year, trade experts at Harvard University published a report that included a candid assessment of obstacles to a US-UK free trade agreement. Its authors, including former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, reached the conclusion that it is “highly unlikely that a free trade deal between the US and the UK will be secured in the near term”\u0026nbspand, in addition, “the likely potential benefits for British businesses are less than often suggested”.The report focused on likely US demands for access to British food markets and likely British demands for access for British firms to US financial and professional services markets. These demands map the likely direction a US-UK free trade agreement would take both countries. Britain is attractive to the US as a market for agricultural products and for goods manufactured through US-controlled supply chains. Britain is also seen by some as a source of relatively low cost financial and professional services. Without an EU customs union, American business does not see Britain as a manufacturing platform – British wages are too high given the distance to the North American market. Labour costs per hour in manufacturing are on average £27 in the US and £23 in the UK – a £4 difference that does not compensate for transport costs.In a UK detached from the European market, the role of British industry in European supply chains will therefore not be replaced by similar roles in US-based supply chains. This is the critical point for UK manufacturing – we cannot replace European supply chain integration with North American supply chain integration.In addition, if British food safety rules are relaxed as part of a trade deal with the US, it is likely that cheap American agricultural products will significantly displace British agriculture. So we will eat chlorinated chicken from Arkansas, bake with GM flour from Dakota\u0026nbspand barbecue antibiotic drenched beef from Illinois. US farming is largely in the hands of mega industrial organisations. Agriculture is a much greater proportion of US GDP than it is of UK GDP. There are farms in Texas that are bigger than major UK counties – 500 square miles, for example. We cannot compete with agriculture on that scale without harming our landscape and bioersity, especially given that we already use substantially more of our land in percentage terms on agriculture than does the US. If our markets are opened up to US agricultural products, UK farming will either adapt to US food safety practices and scale or our agriculture will diminish greatly. If we were to follow the bidding of the arch-Brexiteers and take the US as our model partner it would be the end of our landscape and bioersity as we currently know it.In the place of agriculture and industry, there will be a US market for British financial services and other professional services such as\u0026nbsplaw, accountancy and management consulting. However, just as we have seen the integration of British manufacturing into European firms, we will likely see a wave of mergers and acquisitions in services as British firms are acquired by US firms seeking to serve the US market with British professionals. As a consequence, while\u0026nbspmanufacturing and agriculture would suffer, services and finance might not remain in British hands, especially given the current takeover regime that substantially limits the scope for government protection of UK businesses.A Britain without a customs union with the EU and with a free trade agreement with the US would have less industry, less agriculture, but more finance and more service sector jobs. It would likely be a Britain of growing regional and social disparities, and a Britain more vulnerable to financial instability. After all, it was the high concentration of financial services in the UK economy that meant we were hit particularly hard by the last financial crisis. If the UK economy consolidates further around finance, then we will become even more vulnerable.Turning from North America some look to the Commonwealth as an alternative future that harks to our past. We have strong ties to English-speaking Commonwealth countries around the world – economic ties as well as ties of language, immigration and history. In a digital world, we have the possibility of building networks of innovation that could contribute both to our own industrial competitiveness as well as the competitiveness of our partners.Countries as erse as Nigeria, Australia and India are all racing to be centres of technological innovation and to solve pressing problems in areas such as energy and education. In a sense, if we are open to our former colonies as partners, and generous with access to our own centres of innovation, we could perhaps create alternative pathways to competitiveness for our industry.But those same countries have requested access to the UK through preferential visa arrangements as part of any free trade agreement. India has requested an increase in the number of visas issued to skilled Indian workers and allow students to stay for longer after graduating, but so far government has refused calls to relax visa rules even within the current framework. Australia and other Commonwealth countries want their citizens to be granted the same rights as Europeans: to live and work in the UK after Brexit.Building a competitive commonwealth innovation network effectively requires the opposite of our current attitudes towards the Global South. Commonwealth leaders have criticised the government’s – reported – characterisation of post-Brexit trade as ‘Empire 2.0’. This was reflected in our treatment of the Windrush generation, which, in a sense, like our approach to Brexit, threatens to close critical doors to a better future for British industry and for Britain as a whole.Whether we look to North America or the Commonwealth, into our past or forward to the type of economy we want to become, the arguments bring us back to a customs union with the EU and an industrial strategy that will help rebalance the economy and provide the directed investment to get it growing again. The billions poured by the Bank of England into quantitative easing have signally failed to do this.A Labour government would invest £250bn over 10 years through our National Transformation Fund, and set up a National Investment Bank, as well as a network of regional development banks to channel investment into productive enterprises across the country, unlocking productivity and creating growth.Royal family release official photos from Prince Louis’s christeningPrince William and Prince Charles ‘refused to meet Trump’A history of tense meetings between US and Russian presidentsWe need to understand as we approach critical decision points around our trade policy and our financial regulatory policy\u0026nbspthat these are choices that will shape not just our relations with the outside world but Britain itself – that choices labelled trade policy or immigration policy or financial regulatory policy are in fact industrial policy, agricultural policy and economic policy.The Tory party ideologues are in no state to set out a vision for our future economy, far less to rationally assess the policies needed to make it a reality. Financialisation has proven to be an economic dead-end, creating wealth for the few at the expense of social equality, regional balance and long-term productivity growth.To build a more competitive and equal Britain post-Brexit we need a deal that strengthens our productive sectors such as manufacturing rather than one that deepens financialisation and risks our long-term prosperity. We also need a real industrial strategy based on our regional strengths that enables investment in the productive economy, delivering jobs in our towns as well as our cities that creates value regionally and nationally that can be shared by all.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies.

But nationally commissioned employment and skills services have failed to work with them, and have failed to support people who face the greatest barriers to work.”“Government needs to rethink this approach. Power and funding should be devolved to our towns, cities and rural areas, so that they can build back-to-work services that really meet the needs of local communities and local economies. Housing associations should be key partners in this, working to help their tenants to access decent jobs.”A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions told\u0026nbspThe Independent:\u0026nbsp“Making sure our jobs market works for everyone is at the heart of what we do, and the employment rate is now at a record high of 75.7 per cent. With over 3.3 million more people in work since 2010, we have seen on average 1,000 more people in work each and every day.“Around £100 million of funding has been devolved to London and Greater Manchester to procure and deliver localised versions of our Work and Health programme, capitalising on local knowledge and good practice.

That has yet to be finally determined.”Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative chairwoman of the health committee, urged her to be “transparent” with the public about what they needed to do to prepare for a no deal.Her committee had heard evidence that people with long-term health conditions would be uninsurable in those circumstances, she warned.The prime minister said the government would be issuing technical notices to people working in specific areas – while insisting a deal was still possible by October.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She will be joined by Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland\u0026nbspsecretary.Work and pensions secretary\u0026nbspEsther McVey, meanwhile, is due to give a speech on universal credit.Other ministers are making the most of the so-called take out the trash day as Parliament winds down before its summer break. A whopping 18 statements are expected from government departments on issues ranging from immigration to sex education. Ministers have traditionally used the\u0026nbspend of the parliamentary term to announce potentially\u0026nbspnegative or controversial news.The Conservatives have just issued a statement on the Julian\u0026nbspSmith row.\u0026nbspA spokesperson said: We have apologised for the fact that a pregnancy pairing arrangement was broken in error this week. No other pairs offered on the Trade Bill on Tuesday were broken.\u0026nbspInterestingly, the statement includes no denial of claims that other MPs were asked to break their pairs. Reports suggest at least two refused to do so.\u0026nbspPressure is definitely mounting on the chief whip...Theresa May has backed under pressure chief whip Julian Smith.\u0026nbspAsked if the prime minister stood by claims that the events that saw Brandon Lewis breach a pairing arrangement were an honest mistake, a No 10 spokesperson simply said: Absolutely.Julian\u0026nbspSmith, the government\u0027s chief whip, is facing calls to resign after Tory chairman\u0026nbspBrandon Lewis breached a long-standing convention by voting in Tuesday\u0027s crunch Brexit votes, despite having been paired with the Lib Dem\u0027s Jo Swinson, who has just had a baby.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSmith,\u0026nbspLewis and Theresa May have\u0026nbspinsisted it was a genuine mistake, but The Times reported this morning that Smith had also told two other MPs to ignore pairing arrangements (they refused).\u0026nbspLabour said if that is true then the chief whip should resign. Dawn Butler, the shadow women and equalities minister, said:\u0026nbspIf these reports are correct, the Tory whips, Brandon Lewis and even the prime minister have been telling untruths about their shocking move against an MP on maternity leave.\u0026nbspBreaking a pairing arrangement was a desperate move by a collapsing government and makes politics even more inaccessible for women.\u0026nbspWe need a full, honest explanation of what\u0027s gone on. If they can\u0027t do so, surely the chief whip and Conservative Party chair should resign.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSir Keir Starmer, Labour\u0027s shadow Brexit secretary,\u0026nbspasks Dominic Raab about comments made by leading Brexiteer Steve Baker, who said 40 Tory MPs would be willing to vote down the government\u0027s\u0026nbspplan.\u0026nbspStarmer asks how the government will get its plan through Parliament.\u0026nbspRaab says Starmer seems more interested in doing the job of whipping this side than coming up with any serious, substantive proposals from his side.\u0026nbspStarmer gives it another crack, asking Raab whether he personally is prepared to face down that threat.\u0026nbspThe Brexit secretary says he is not interested in the media circus or any of the drama because he is relentlessly and unflinchingly focused on narrowing the differences, accentuating the positives and getting a win-win deal good for this country and good for our European friends.The SNP\u0027s Peter Grant asks about an HM Inspectorate of Constabulary\u0026nbspreport out today, which suggests police forces\u0026nbspshould prepare for Brexit leading to a rise in hate crime.\u0026nbspNew Brexit minister Chris Heaton-Harris\u0026nbspsays he does not believe in the slightest that Brexit will result in more hate crime.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexiteer Peter Bone asks about rumours the government is considering asking the EU to extend the Article 50 period.\u0026nbspRobin Walker, a Brexit minister, denies this, saying he is happy to reassure MPs that the UK will be leaving the EU next March, as outlined in the EU Withdrawal Bill and the government\u0027s White Paper.Dominic Raab tells MPs he hopes to intensify negotiations on the future relationship with the EU, following\u0026nbspthe publication of the government\u0027s Brexit White Paper.\u0026nbspResponding to Tory Brexiteer John Whittingdale, he also suggests the UK could withhold its Brexit bill payment unless the EU agrees\u0026nbspto a deal.\u0026nbspHe says:\u0026nbspAs the EU says, there\u0027s no deal until the whole deal is concluded...If one party does not meet its side of the bargain,\u0026nbspit would inevitably have consequences for the deal as a whole.\u0026nbspHe also says staying in the EU single market and customs union would be a\u0026nbspbreach of the referendum and also a breach of the Tory\u0027s manifesto pledge to leave both.Labour\u0027s Virendra Sharma asks\u0026nbspDominic Raab to guarantee he will\u0026nbspnot use Brexit as an excuse to slash protections for minorities,\u0026nbspgiven he has previously said he does not believe in economic and social rights.\u0026nbspSuella Braverman, one of Raab\u0027s junior ministers, says the new Brexit secretary has a proven track record not only as a justice minister but also as a lawyer,\u0026nbspand any attempt to undermine his credentials and commitment to the rule of law, civil liberties and now delivering a successful Brexit is fundamentally misguided.\u0026nbspLabour frontbencher Paul Blomfeld follows a similar theme, asking why Raab\u0026nbsppreviously called Brexit an opportunity to\u0026nbspditch the most burdensome EU regulations, including those that protect agency workers by giving them the same rights as full-time staff.\u0026nbspBraverman\u0026nbspsays the government\u0027s commitment to employment protections is unequivocal.\u0026nbspShe adds:\u0026nbspRights don\u0027t emanate from the EU - we have our own rich and proud tradition of civil liberties.There is laughter in the Commons as John Bercow, the Speaker, confuses Conservative MP Rachel Maclean with Labour\u0027s Rachel Maskell.\u0026nbspHe apologises, saying it was a result of his confusion rather than their lack of distinctiveness, but\u0026nbspMaclean gets her own back by jokingly referring to him as Mr Deputy Speaker.Dominic Raab has just started answering MPs questions in the Commons.\u0026nbspHe is asked by Labour\u0027s shadow Brexit minister, Matt Pennycook, what advice the government is giving to financial services in relation to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspWelcome to The Independent\u0027s live coverage from Westminster.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As a result of the conclusions of this analysis, we will now be paying arrears to those affected back to their date of conversion to ESA.“My department will be contacting all those identified as potentially affected as planned. Once an inidual is contacted, and the relevant information gathered, they can expect to receive appropriate payment within 12 weeks.”\u0026nbspShe also confirmed that once contacted, claimants would be provided with a dedicated free phone number on which they can make contact with the department.Responding, Carla Clarke, solicitor for Child Poverty Action Group, which launched the legal action, said: “Poor and inadequate DWP processes left up to 70,000 disabled iniduals without the support they should have received to help them with their additional costs. \u0026nbsp“Justice required that the DWP error was corrected in its entirety for the people affected, many of whom are owed arrears from 2011. We are pleased that the DWP agreed that this was correct following our legal action.\u0026nbsp“However, it shouldn’t be necessary to take a government department to court to achieve justice for people who have been failed by officials making avoidable errors.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They’ve hired almost a thousand customs officials just in case Britain crashes out.“We’re a trading nation we cannot afford our customs system to completely get stuck because from one day to the next we also have to check all the British exports of goods and services. We also hired veterinary officials because if you crash out, you also have that problem.”Dutch port officials told The Independent this year the Netherlands’\u0026nbspcustoms authorities were aiming to hire between 750 and 930 officials – suggesting the number actually hired is right at the upper end of that early estimate as talks look increasingly likely to fail.On Friday, ministers from the remaining 27 EU states are expected to be presented with a dossier drawn up by the European Commission laying out how to plan for a “no deal” Brexit.\u0026nbspWe cannot afford our customs system to completely get stuck because from one day to the next we also have to check all the British exportsThe Netherlands has been amongst the best prepared EU member states regarding Brexit, with ports like Rotterdam and hub airports like Schipol planning significant physical changes to accommodate the extra checks likely to slow down trade following Britain’s departure.Preparations in the UK are behind schedule for a “no deal” scenario, with huge overflow lorry parks needed to accommodate freight in Kent not expected to be completed in time if Britain does crash out.Mr Omtzigt was scathing at the UK’s lack of preparations for its Brexit talks and the timing of the white paper outlining the nation’s Brexit ambitions: “I share concerns that it’s a bit late in the day, that one year and four months after tabling the Article 50 notification, the UK makes a proposal.“I think it’s a proposal that’s a good starting point for negotiations – but it’s a proposal to start negotiations. It would have been helpful that that had been on the table the day the negotiations started.”Ms May\u0026nbsphas repeatedly said “no deal is better than a bad deal” and threatened to lead the UK off an economic cliff edge if she does not get her way in talks with the EU.Asked whether the UK was hiring more customs officers, cabinet office minister David Lidington\u0026nbspsaid: “I think that all governments, including the United Kingdom government, have to plan for all contingencies.”Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

In pubs, in shop windows, on cars, on scaffolding, on hats and shirts and flying above 10 Downing Street.And nobody was sneering at our flag now. Just guessing, but I doubt if anyone will be sneering at that flag any time soon.Not even Labour’s Emily Thornberry.What a ride. What a month-long high. What an adventure for those of us who are old enough to remember 1966 and also for the children who will remember this as the first World Cup they watched.Fifty years from today, those kids will still remember how they felt when England won a penalty shootout against Colombia, and when Kieran Trippier bent it better than Beckham after five minutes against Croatia.And they will remember to their dying day exactly what it felt like when we knew that England was not going to the final.The tears are real but so is the pride. And the pride — even more than the disappointment — is the overwhelming emotion today.England played with big hearts, true grit and the fearlessness of youth.They come home not as legends to rival the boys of 1966 but with their heads held high. Their nation is proud of them.And yes, it is only a game. It is not a war. Nobody died.But at a time when our nation is more horribly divided than at any time in modern history, we were reminded what a great country this still is, and how much we have to be proud of, and how much there is to love.And it was not your imagination — England was united once again.“Our country has been through difficult times in terms of unity,” said England’s young manager in his thoughtful, softly spoken manner.“Sport — football in particular — has the power to help that.“We’re a team that, with our diversity and our youth, represents modern England.In England, we have spent a bit of time being a bit lost as to what our modern identity is. I think we represent that modern identity and hopefully people can connect with us.”Gareth Southgate is right about the healing power of sport. This World Cup brought us together in a way we’ve not experienced since the London 2012 Olympics.But 2012 was before the bitter wounds of Brexit.It is Gareth Southgate himself who is the main reason this country has rallied around this England team.Southgate with his courtesy, his decency and his Yoda-like intelligence.Southgate,  who talks about “owning the process” and “managing our energy” — it is quite difficult to imagine the former England manager, Big Sam Allardyce, being comfortable with that kind of 21st Century dialogue. Southgate with his dapper shirt, tie and waistcoat combo, as suave as a suburban James Bond.Southgate who carries himself as if he is the living embodiment of Rudyard Kipling’s most famous poem.“If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those imposters just the same . . . you will be a man, my son!”Even as England were celebrating their very first win in a World Cup penalty shootout, Southgate took time to comfort Mateus Uribe, one of the two Colombian players who had missed their penalty.This was more than an act of sportsmanship. It was an act of humanity.Because we all knew that Southgate has been there.The abiding memory of Gareth Southgate as a player — the one moment that everyone remembers — is in Euro 1996, with his shoulders sagging inside a grey England shirt and his spirit smashed after missing a penalty (we never recall the players who were too cowardly to step up and take a penalty — history gives them a pass).Stuart “Psycho” Pearce had known penalty redemption — missing in Italia 1990 but scoring in Euro 1996. Southgate’s redemption has been infinitely more convoluted.There was an image that went viral of the 25-year-old Gareth Southgate after just missing a penalty in 1996 being comforted by the 47-year-old Gareth Southgate who shook up the world in Russia in 2018.If this World Cup has gone some way to healing our divided nation, it has also gone a long way to healing the pain that Southgate has endured for half a lifetime.It is true what they say ­— success is not final, failure is not fatal.The manager was well served by this young team, who were light years away from the central casting image of the Premier League footballer — the pampered, wag-shagging, blingtastic, Bentley-crashing, multi-millionaire airhead.These England footballers — even the star striker, Harry Kane, who would cost a minimum £100million if Real Madrid came knocking — were clearly of and from the working class.They hail, every one of them, from modest beginnings. Most of the squad — 15 — paid their Premier League dues while out on loan in the lump-kicking lower leagues.“Barnsley, Leeds, Bolton, Blackburn,” said Southgate. “We’re lads who have come from those places.”This England team are not ordinary boys — they are elite professional athletes — but they have all been ordinary boys, and there was a humility about them, a work ethic and total lack of pretension that made you believe they will never forget their roots.And if they come from everywhere from the North East to Yorkshire to the Essex/East End borders, they also come from every kind of family.There were those who grew up in solid nuclear families with both mum and dad and siblings present, and those who were raised by single mums, and those who are from domestic chaos.Raheem Sterling’s father was murdered in Jamaica when he was two, and Dele Alli escaped the turmoil of his riven family life by moving in with his best friend’s family when he was 13.Their backstories are as diverse as our nation, but every one of them has grafted to get to the top.Sterling was berated for having an assault rifle tattooed on his leg but nobody ran harder or longer for the England cause than Raheem.When you watched his mesmeric, lung-busting runs, how could you not warm to him?How could you not forgive one dumb tatt?“Good lads,” said Southgate of his England squad, those boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne, from Bury and Leeds and Sheffield, and once again he said it all.They are good lads and we cheered them, and celebrated with them, and in the end, we shared their pain because it was our pain too, even in defeat against Belgium yesterday.They were a band of brothers and for one magical sun-drenched summer month, they lit up our nation.This World Cup was a roller-coaster ride that grabbed you by the scruff of your replica Three Lions shirt from the first match against Tunisia and refused to let go until the end of extra time against Croatia.They came SO CLOSE — Croatia led England for 11 minutes.That’s how agonisingly near we were to saying, “Bonjour, Monsieur,” in today’s World Cup final.It was gloriously entertaining, but it was also far more than just entertainment.It felt like Gareth Southgate and that young England team represented the very best of us.We learned — or we were reminded — that decency is not weakness, sportsmanship is not soft, and you need never feel one twinge of shame if you give your all.And we learned that we love our national game with a passion that can never be denied.I honestly thought we would win it.Typical England fan!I believed that this was the year we added the second World Cup winner’s gold star to the team shirt.When the England players were chucking around rubber chickens at a training session just before the Croatia semi-final, I thought it was a tension-busting masterstroke.It wasn’t to be.But this England team have been through the full range of human emotions — from joy to despair, hope to disappointment, and this country has been with them every step of the way.The struggle continues, the dream will never die.I reckon 50,000 England football fans will already be making plans to go to Qatar in 2022.This World Cup will be remembered for breaking our hearts and uniting our nation.And a grateful, emotionally exhausted country has just two words for those Three Lions.Thank you. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One able to set its own laws and control its borders.The idea of taking diktats from European courts, having no border control, and being unable to strike free trade deals — while paying Brussels £39billion — is not the Brexit people voted for.Mrs May should look at our poll today to see the bloody nose the Tories could be dealt at the next General Election.Unless she starts being honest with the country, then she will cause further disillusionment among voters, potentially opening the door to Jeremy Corbyn…Ushering in Britain’s first Marxist PM should not be a legacy Mrs May wants. EXPECTATIONS were not high before the World Cup began — for once.With the pressure lifted off the players’ shoulders — combined with Gareth Southgate’s leadership — our boys played with passion and determination.Despite yesterday’s loss to Belgium, they were real ambassadors for England.Meanwhile, the FA are set to apply for the 2030 World Cup. Good. About time.The tournament will mark a century since the first one in Uruguay.

But this surely depends upon what the other possibilities are. This deserves the serious analysis that Mrs May and her team have apparently not given it.There are broadly two options. The first is to accept one of the off-the-shelf arrangements. The one that most closely accords with achieving a full Brexit, corresponding to what people voted for two years ago, is the recently agreed EU deal with Canada.This is not ideal for us, but it is pretty good. It might be possible to add some bells and whistles that extend the scope of the agreement, particularly with regard to services. This is what is known as “Canada plus”.With or without the plus, this would give us tariff and barrier-free trade between the EU and the UK while ending free movement of people, the payment of substantial sums to Brussels each year and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, while enabling us to sign FTAs with whoever we wanted to.Interestingly, the EU offered us the Canada deal earlier this year but this was turned down by the Prime Minister, supposedly because it wasn’t ambitious enough and because it would not provide a solution to the supposed “problems” concerning the Irish border.Since then, Mrs May’s ambitions have decayed to the delivery of abject surrender while not saying so.As to the Irish border, it has been clear for some time that these “problems” have been manufactured by the Remain-leaning establishment precisely as a way of blocking a full Brexit.There is no need for a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. It is perfectly possible for goods to move freely across the border, relying on pre-registration and subsequent random checks.There is already a soft border between the Irish republic and Northern Ireland with regard to currencies, duties and tax rates. This would continue.Of course, it is possible that the EU will not now agree to something like the Canada deal. And the clock is ticking.In that case, there is another perfectly viable option, namely “no deal”. After all, as Mrs May used to say, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.In fact, this “no deal” expression is potentially misleading. It doesn’t mean that we couldn’t or shouldn’t have a deal on anything with the EU, including landing rights for planes, participation in various joint bodies, etc.What it means is simply that we would leave the EU without an agreement on trade, and operate under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.The WTO option is widely misunderstood. It should hold no terrors for us. We currently do the bulk of our trade with non-EU countries under WTO rules. And if we left the EU without a deal we would not have to hand over the £39billion “divorce settlement”.Moreover, the WTO option leaves substantial areas of policy choice, including over what our tariffs are. We could decide to drop tariffs on particular goods but not others for instance, on cars, which currently incur tariffs at ten per cent, and/or on car components, where the rate is five per cent.Or we could decide, unilaterally, to drop all our tariffs to zero.We could start to negotiate FTAs immediately. Just because we fail to secure a trade deal with the EU before next March does not mean we can never secure such a deal.Indeed, we could put the EU “at the front of the queue” for trade deals. We would be able to conduct negotiations without the pressures emanating from the ticking clock imposed, arbitrarily and ridiculously, under the Lisbon Treaty.Of course, trading under WTO rules would still leave the much-dreaded “trade frictions” and possible delays at the border as we lose the supposedly huge advantages of Single Market membership. But these frictions have been massively overblown by the UK establishment. WTO rules oblige members (including the EU) to facilitate frictionless trade.John Mills, the Eurosceptic economist and Labour donor, has come up with estimates of border costs that are a fraction of the official ones.His view is especially worth noting because, unlike the civil servants behind the official view, he runs his own very successful business importing large amounts of consumer goods. I know whose estimates I believe.Some critics will say that this is all very well for finished goods, but not for the businesses that operate complex supply chains. To listen to them you would think that these only operate within the EU.In fact there are complex supply chains operating across the world. They seem to manage without common currencies, single markets and all the other paraphernalia so beloved by the EU.Meanwhile, umpteen countries around the world sell huge amounts into the EU without being members of the Single Market. How do they manage to overcome those pesky barriers, I wonder?Whatever difficulties may occur in the immediate aftermath of a full Brexit, this does not represent the final destination. Only when FTAs are in place with a broad swathe of countries, including the US, will we be able to see the full impact.The argument that we must accept the Chequers fudge just does not add up. Who do they think they are kidding — us or themselves? “There are none so blind as those who will not see.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And they still judged it too tricky.Last year in the West Midlands burglary was up 11 per cent. Guess why.On so-called “low-level” crime, some forces have shamefully just surrendered.WHY was France’s President Macron buddying up to Putin at the World Cup final?We don’t begrudge him his moment of glory, of course. His team deservedly won. But Putin’s regime is guilty of ­heinous crimes, from the Salisbury poisonings to the downing of a jumbo jet.Four months ago France expelled four Russian diplomats. Was it just a stunt?This wasn’t a summit for world peace, as Donald Trump’s was yesterday. It was a football jolly, sealing a month-long PR triumph for the Kremlin.Macron should have watched from Paris.TAKING back control of our borders won’t mean a thing if we fail to exercise it.It is worrying that immigration has gone up again thanks to a 13-year high in those arriving from outside the EU — which the Government CAN limit.For years the totals have been too great for our communities to cope with. Where are the new homes, hospitals or transport for the 280,000 net migrants in 2017?We’re all for immigration to benefit our economy.

It would have kept us shackled to Brussels’ rules for all time, with no say over any of them.All the ambition for our great country as a newly independent global trader would have been swept away. We would have all the possible short-term pain of leaving, with no long-term gain.Theresa May’s Chequers plan is a feeble Brexit, but at least it’s freedom of a sort. That cannot be said of a customs union.It was repugnant to watch Westminster’s Remainer elite line up to argue for tying us to the EU, and pretend the Leave verdict didn’t mean actually leaving.Many seemed to treat it like a game, oblivious to the terrible danger they would have unleashed had they won.For once, and however briefly, the Government has something to celebrate.OF all the attempts to thwart Brexit, the campaign to pretend the referendum wasn’t fair is the most pathetic and dishonest.The Electoral Commission’s probe into Vote Leave’s alleged overspending is fatally flawed if it failed even to interview those who ran it.Worse, it has not applied the same scrutiny to the Remain camp, which clearly co-ordinated smaller groups just as Vote Leave is said to have done.As for Remainers claiming this alleged overspend skewed a tight referendum, what cobblers. The Commission’s own figures show Remain vastly outspent Leave — on top of the £9million David Cameron wasted leafleting every home begging us to vote to stay in.The odds were massively stacked against Leave and they still won.This Remain rearguard action has nothing to do with the vote’s legitimacy.It is just a continuing tantrum, aimed at the 17.4million who disagreed with them.IMAGINE the outrage if a newspaper hosted online videos of kids being abused.Facebook does, and refuses to remove them. It just marks them “disturbing” and limits them to users claiming to be over 18.

Blow after blow rains down on her authority. She is battered and bruised by her own party yet refuses to realise her time is up.The past few days have brought yet more resignations. Following the Foreign Secretary and the Brexit Secretary are ministers whose names escape me let’s call them Cuthbert, Dibble and Grubb.Though hardly well known, these MPs have grandly flounced off in protest at May’s handling of Brexit.In a particularly odd development, one is leaving the Government because he thinks the Government is not sticking to the spirit of government policy.All this on top of last week’s embarrassment, courtesy of Donald Trump. The President might have softened his comments about the Prime Minister and the “turmoil” afflicting the UK but the damage to May’s authority was done.God knows how this looks to the rest of the world. We used to bestride the international stage like a colossus now we stumble across it like Frank Spencer.The Prime Minister can’t take all the blame. She has been dealt a difficult hand — her party and the country split on Brexit, Europe turning the thumbscrews and Ukip waiting in the wings to hoover up Tory votes. It would be hard for any politician to make an outright success of this.But where Theresa May HAS failed categorically is on communicating her plans to the British people.The Chequers deal should have been a big moment. She should have been all over the TV stations selling this deal hard.In the past, prime ministers held public broadcasts to explain important matters to the people. Anthony Eden gave one on the Suez crisis, Harold Wilson on the devaluation of the Pound. Ted Heath warned in 1973 that the nation faced “the hardest Christmas that we have known since the war”.These leaders looked the nation in the eye, spoke directly to the British people — and LED.Theresa May, on the other hand, seems reluctant to get out and make the case for her own policy.Little wonder that two thirds of the public questioned on the Chequers deal were baffled by it. Confusion reigns.This points to a major problem with May’s premiership. She is hopeless at telling a national story.It’s the job of a leader not just to make decisions but to inspire the nation. For the person in No10, their words speak as loudly as their actions. They need to tell a compelling story about where Britain is going.Margaret Thatcher told the story of Britain emerging from the ashes of socialism thanks to the hard work and enterprise of its people: “A get-up-and-go instead of a sit-back-and-wait-for- it Britain.”Tony Blair told the story of Britain shrugging off the past and embracing the modern world: “A new Britain . . . a model 21st-century nation, based not on privilege, class or background, but on the equal worth of all.”David Cameron told the story of Britain clearing up the economic mess left by Labour, paying down our debts and living within our means.Love or loathe these leaders, at least they told a clear story about where Britain was going. We get none of this from May.She makes a virtue of just “getting on with the job”. But in a nation divided on Brexit, we desperately need more. We need a clear sense of direction for Britain’s future.Of course, the Prime Minister cannot last for much longer. In boxing terms she’s in the 12th round. Before long there will be a leadership contest — and those hoping to succeed May must learn from where she went wrong.The next resident of No10 must not only have the right policies but the right vision.If Britain is to regain its reputation abroad, and its self-respect at home, we urgently need a Prime Minister who inspires, who tells a national story — and who truly leads.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They wrote: Looks like Australia as well. One of the things I love about the UK is how green it usually is.It will all come back eventually, but its amazing to see this level of yellow and brown.Another added: This is right by my house, all around you can see peoples grass dying its quite sad really.Describing why the field looked so dry, the user explained: No it’s England. I’ve always wanted to get a good picture of this field so I pulled my phone out and snapped a pic, were currently having a heatwave so all the grass has dried up.The lack of rain has caused hosepipe bans in some areas of the UK, with United Utilities bringing in a restriction for seven million households from August 5.The ban will apply to its domestic customers in the north west.The company had previously urged homeowners to reduce the amount of water they were using by ditching the bath for a four minute shower.A Met Office spokesman said: It is important to remember we are only half way through the season, and a lot can change.Some showers are expected, after weeks of no rain this before heatwave conditions return.Temperatures are expected to hit 30C across the south and south east by July 21."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000218240119.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"thousands of brits set to get up to 10k extra after bungling officials screw up benefits payments","story":"Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey announced her department will have to pay out millions more to make up for previous errors.The extra cash will go to disabled claimants who were switched from Incapacity Benefit to Employment and Support Allowance between 2011 and 2014.An estimated 70,000 people are eligible for compensation of up to £10,000, with the average payout likely to be around £5,000.The DWP already faced a bill of £340million for claimants who lost out because of the departments mistakes from October 2014 onwards.Now the scheme is being extended as far back as 2011 following a scathing report from the Public Accounts Committee.The report found ESA claimants had been routinely underpaid after switching to the benefit.Hours after it was published, Ms McVey pledged to take further action to ensure that no disabled Brits miss out on what they should have received.She said: I hope this will help members to provide reassurance to their constituents who think they may have been affected that they will receive all the money they are entitled to.But campaigning MP Frank Field warned that ESA claimants had still been denied other benefits such as free school meals, dentists bills and NHS prescriptions.He said: The department failed to listen to claimants, charities and even its own staff when they sounded the alarm.Their warnings fell on deaf ears, and tens of thousands of people lost out as a result.

They will also ensure children learn how to recognise when others are struggling with mental health and how to respond.The classes will help bolster “healthy friendships, family relationships and other relationships they are likely to encounter”.Mr Hinds said: “I want to make sure that our children are able to grow up to become happy and well-rounded individuals who know how to deal with the challenges of the modern world.“Part of this is making sure they are informed about how to keep themselves safe and healthy and have good relationships with others.He added: “Good physical and mental health is also at the heart of ensuring young people are ready for the adult world.By making health education compulsory we are giving young people the tools they need to be ready to thrive when they leave school.”Chris Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the Institute for Economic Affairs, said: “No one disagrees with ‘health education in principle, but the curriculum is becoming so packed with worthy causes that children will soon not have time to read and write.“Children are already bombarded by endless healthy eating messages at school.

Sadly, a year or so later they also voted to keep the appalling Anna Soubry as their local MP. Let’s hope they never make that mistake again.For the last year this bilious, jabbering woman has done everything she possibly can to thwart the will of her electors.She is a staunch Remainer and is seemingly prepared to bring down the Government to get her way. Her actions suggest she couldn’t give a monkey’s about what the people in her constituency think.Two nights ago she was one of 12 Conservative rebels who voted against the Government. She wanted Britain to remain part of a customs union with the EU. That would mean — effectively — no real Brexit. And if they had won, it would have been catastrophe for the Government. And in my opinion, the country.The reason they didn’t lose is solely down to a bunch of courageous Labour MPs, including the excellent Frank Field, who voted with the Government. Soubry isn’t alone, of course. The people of Loughborough, Leics, also voted by a large margin to leave the EU.But they are represented in the House of Commons by Nicky Morgan, who appears not to give a toss what they think. She also voted for a customs union. Nicky is famous among many for being the second worst Education Secretary this country has ever had. She’s pipped to the post for that particular prize by Justine Greening.Being useless in their Cabinet posts isn’t the only thing that unites these two women. Greening is also opposed to Brexit and she has even called for a second referendum. Because she didn’t like the result of the first one.The people of Beaconsfield, Bucks, voted to leave the EU. But their MP, the grim Dominic Grieve, who resembles a funeral director from about 1923, appears not to care less. He has said he’s prepared to “collapse” the Government if he does not get his way.Sarah Wollaston is another one. Another embittered MP. Her constituency, Totnes in Devon, voted to leave by a sizeable margin.Because while it is true that the majority of Labour MPs are also opposed to Brexit, they have been nothing like as dangerous as the Tory rebels.We are in a mess. The Prime Minister staggers from crisis to crisis, striking meaningless deals whenever she can to stave off defeat for a few more days.She surely cannot last much longer. A Remainer herself, of course, I think she should be persuaded to call it a day. Go home, put her feet up. And let her party elect a leader who will take no more c**p from Brussels.And no more c**p from the likes of Soubry and Greening, either.THE top scientist Richard Dawkins – Britain’s most famous atheist – has got himself into trouble.He has said that he prefers to hear the sound of cathedral bells to the muezzin wail calling Muslims to prayer.  Saying something as inoffensive as that is enough to get you into hot water these days.Dawkins has been called a bigot as a consequence. I have to say I disagree with him. I love the sound of cathedral bells, sure.But I also enjoying hearing the Muslim call to prayer – when I’ve been on my travels in Morocco or Malaysia. But, over here, it’s cathedral bells for me every time.Here’s a tip, then.Take them to an expensive shoe shop and make them look at the display through the window.And remember the noise they make.KATIE PRICE is on holiday in Thailand and of course she’s got her baps out.  This might be a problem for Katie, pictured with boyfriend Kris Boyson.Topless sunbathing is against the law over there. This is because tourists enjoy looking at the scenic islands. Without having their view obliterated by a pair of breasts the size of Koh Samui.So watch yourself, Katie. And as a break from lying on the beach, how do you fancy a spot of caving?YOU’VE got to love the toffs, haven’t you?  Most of them are absolutely crazy after years of inbreeding.Take the brilliant Lizzie Purbrick who described herself as “a very well-bred toff”.  She went round to her married lover’s home after he’d cheated on her with a third woman.No messing with Lizzie. She took with her eight litres of pig’s blood which she sprayed across his flat. She daubed the words “slut” and “whore” and “big d**k lord” on his walls and sprayed a giant penis on the floor.  She said: “So many people have said I should write my life story, but I’m so bonkers I can’t remember it.”The judge said – in one of the great under-statements of the decade – that she had “real concerns about the defendant’s ability to make rational decisions”.No s**t, Sherlock.It started out a few years back with just a couple of stalls. Now the entire town centre is closed off and thousands turn up to pig themselves on cuisine from scores of nationalities.I got so stuffed last year I needed to be helped home. And not a chicken parmo – the supposed Teesside dish of choice – in sight.IT’S not often that the Labour peer Dame Margaret Hodge says something worth repeating. But in telling her party leader Jeremy Corbyn that he was a “f***ing anti-Semite and a racist” I think she kinda hit the nail on the head.Meanwhile, the decent, moderate Labour MP John Woodcock has resigned the party whip and become an independent.Long-time party members – like I was, until last year – know that Labour is currently led by a hard-left anti-Jewish rabble of thickoes.I hope the voters twig this sooner or later.AND now it’s time for Hypocrites of the Week. A special award for Pimlico Plumbers of London.They’ve put up a giant banner outside their premises about Brexit, saying: “Nobody voted to be poorer!”Pimlico Plumbers has just lost a landmark case brought by one of its employees. He, like almost all of their staff, was kept on a contract which allowed the firm to pay him less than the proper rate.They were done under a UK Supreme Court decision, using laws designed to stop unscrupulous firms exploiting cheap labour.I wonder what it is about the EU that Pimlico Plumbers likes so much?

A spokesman said that given Mr Lewis only took part in two of nine votes – the closest two - “it seems hard to take the explanation at face value”.Lib Dem whip Alistair Carmichael said the problem was “symptomatic of a wider problem”.

Fertility rates fell for every age group apart from the over 40s, where there were more births than at any point since 1949.The shock figures came a day after experts warned Britain faced 50 years of austerity because health spending will have to double to cope with the dramatic rise in old-age pensioners.Tory peer Ros Altmann told The Sun: “This is just a glimpse of the demographic disaster that awaits us.The Government needs to get a grip of this and develop policies that address pension costs, health costs and social care.”The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) on Tuesday said the number of over 65s as a proportion of the working age population would rise from just below 30 per cent to nearly 50 per cent by the 2060s.Age related spending is expected to take up nearly a third of the Government’s entire budget at this time.Yesterday’s birth figures revealed foreign-born Mums accounted for 28.4 per cent of all births in 2017 – a new record and up from 28.2 per cent in 2016 and just 11.6 per cent in 1990.The stillbirth rate fell to the lowest rate since current records began in 1927.ONS spokeswoman Nicola Haines said: Birth rates for live births have decreased for all women except those aged 40 years and over where the birth rate has continued to rise, following a trend seen for the last 40 years.Despite this, the proportion of women aged 40 and over having a baby still remains below that seen in the 1940s.She added: The stillbirth rate has dropped to a record low, declining each year since 2011.It is a step towards achieving a government ambition to reduce the rate of stillbirths by introducing new maternity strategies while ensuring the best and safest care.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sixty-two MPs voted for the bill, with 55 against.However some clauses were dropped including one that would have enshrined in law the creation of Jewish-only communities.Heres what it all means...The Jewish Nation-State Bill, passed just after the state marked the 70th anniversary of its birth, was hailed as a defining moment in the annals of Zionism by Netanyahu.The bill enshrines Hebrew as the only official language of the state, stripping Arabic of that status, and names Jewish settlement a top priority.Netanyahu said the bill was about defending the Jewish character of the state, which was established in 1948 as a homeland for the Jewish people, for generations to come.We will keep ensuring civil rights in Israels democracy but the majority also has rights and the majority decides, he said.The law becomes one of the so-called Basic Laws, which, like a constitution, guide Israel’s legal system and are usually more difficult to repeal than regular laws.The bill, backed by the countrys right-wing government, says Israel is the historic homeland of the Jewish people and they have an exclusive right to national self-determination in it.The bills critics, including many Arabs, claim it is racist and discriminatory and will plant the seeds of an apartheid state.Israeli Arabs currently make up about 20 per cent of Israels population of around nine million people.They have equal rights under law but say they are being treated as second-class citizens and say they face discrimination and worse provision of services such as education, health and housing.Arab MP Ahmed Tibi said the bills passing represented the death of democracyin Israel.Adalah, a legal centre for Arabs living in Israel, called the law illegitimate and colonial.It said it seeks to maintain a regime in which one ethnic-national group controls an indigenous-national group living in the same territory while advancing ethnic superiority by promoting racist policies.Self determination is the right of a country and its people to be independent, instead of being controlled by a foreign power, and to choose its own form of government.In particular, the principle allows citizens to choose their own political status and to determine their own form of economic, cultural and social development.The impact of the right to self-determination was seen in the 2002 referendum where Gibraltarians hugely rejected a plan to share sovereignty between the UK and Spain.The concept was first embodied in the American Declaration Of Independence (1776) and then in the Frances Declaration Of The Rights Of Man (1789).The ratification of the United Nations Charter in 1945 at the end of war placed the right of self-determination into the framework of international law. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I know simply by doing this piece of media, I will be hounded on social media, it will have a real material impact on my life,\" she said.\"One of the things about the gender recognition debate is it\u0027s given licence to anti-trans activists using this is an excuse to debate our existence\u0026#8230 in a way that has felt very violent.\"It feels extremely painful to have a group of people campaigning against your participation in everyday life.\":: Opinion - \"We need to combat moral hysteria over gender recognition\"   She is talking about the so called gender critical feminists. This is a group of women who are worried that the right to self-identify - essentially ticking a box to become a woman as they see it - is open to abuse, compromising female-only spaces and eroding women\u0027s rights.We were shocked at the vitriol expressed online from both sides of this conflict.Dr Nicola Williams is another staunch feminist embroiled in the debate. She warns that a system which allows anyone to self-certify as women would be open to abuse, and that it would amount to an attack on women\u0027s rights.But all the trans men and women we spoke to were at pains to stress that for them, there is nothing theoretical about this issue.Far from theory, this is their reality. The misunderstanding and misinformation surrounding the GRA and self-identification makes everyday life even harder for a group of people already subject to prejudice and abuse.They point out that the Equalities Act is the law that allows trans people to use the facilities appropriate to their preferred gender.So for many years trans people have been using changing rooms, toilets and women\u0027s services such as rape centres - and there is no evidence to suggest that there has been any problem with this at all.The British Social Attitudes Survey, an annual study of public beliefs carried out by NatCen, gave this year\u0027s findings on attitudes to transgender people exclusively to Sky News.In general, the public seem to be liberal with 84% claiming not to be prejudiced at all against trans people."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-theresa-may-brexit_4362298.jpg?20180715012532 ","title":"eu member states told to step up no deal brexit preparations","story":"\"Today\u0027s text calls on member states and private parties to step up preparations and follows a request by the European Council last month to intensify preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes,\" the bloc\u0027s executive said.\"While the EU is working day and night for a deal ensuring an orderly withdrawal, the UK\u0027s withdrawal will undoubtedly cause disruption - for example in business supply chains - whether or not there is a deal.\"It added \"there is still no certainty that there will be a ratified withdrawal agreement in place on that date [30 March 2019]\".On the prospect of Britain exiting the EU without a deal, Prime Minister Theresa May\u0027s official spokeswoman said the progress made so far suggests \"that is not where we will end up\".The release of the European Commission\u0027s leaflet comes as the new Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab heads to Brussels for talks with Michel Barnier, the EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator.Mrs May, meanwhile, is making her first visit to the Irish border since the 2016 referendum vote."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-jimmy-mizen-youth-crime_4305903.jpg?20180510171647 ","title":"jimmy mizens parents we made a promise to remain positive","story":"For instance, being woken by Jimmy noisily crashing through the front door after a night out!

Sarah Russell stayed on the phone for almost an hour to Jessica Urbano Ramirez, who called 999 complaining she could not escape due to the smoke. The girl told her she lived on the 20th floor but had taken refuge along with others higher up the tower block. Ms Russell said she answered the call, her first, at around 1.15am, and tried to get basic information from the little girl. In a written statement to the public inquiry, the London Fire Brigade control room officer said: I asked the girl what her name was and she told me it was Jessica.   \u0027Whole community\u0027 raped girl, 12, for SEVEN MONTHS in latest horror attack in India  I asked Jessica if she was calling from her phone and I think she said she was. I asked to speak to someone a bit older to try and get some more information from them, but she did not hand it over I do not know why. Perhaps she did not want to. I felt I needed stay with her and that she needed me. I asked her if she wanted me to stay and she said \u0027yes\u0027. I am glad I did - even if it was only to offer her a little support. The fact that she did not hand the phone to anyone else showed to me that she needed it. Ms Russell advised the very scared 12-year-old to go to the room least affected by smoke, shut the windows, stay low and cover her mouth. She went on: After about an hour I could not get anymore response from her - only rasping sounds, then nothing. I stayed on the line a little while longer with my hand hovered over the call termination button. I was torn as what best to do. I eventually ended the call when the line fell silent. Reflecting on that call, I felt completely helpless.

The information that Jessica had fled to a higher floor was not passed on to fire crews on the ground, who searched her flat but found no trace of the youngster. She was one of 72 people who died following the blaze on June 14 last year. Ms Russell revealed that, not long after the call ended, she became aware that the advice to callers had been changed from stay-put to attempt to evacuate. She said she did not recall ringing previous callers back with the changed advice, just answering the relentless calls and updating new callers. There was a lull in the calls at around 5am, Ms Russell said, recalling the words of a fellow operator. She said: It went eerily quiet and a little creepy. I remember someone saying, \u0027I wish they\u0027d call again\u0027. That way we would have known that they were still alive.

An official report today reveals details of a plan to massively ramp up the number of International Driving Permits if the UK fails to reach agreement with the EU. Currently, Brits need the \u0026pound5.50 permits to drive in more than 140 countries outside the EU - and about 100,000 are issued per year. But serious backup plans are now under way to issue them to drivers who go to the EU too, the National Audit Office (NAO) said. This would hugely increase the number of IDPs issued per year, from 100,000 to an estimated 7million.  The number of Post Offices that issue the permits would also have to increase massively, from the current 89 to 4,500 across the country. Today the NAO issued a blunt warning suggesting the plan may not be ready by Brexit Day in March 2019. As yet, there is no business case and no detailed delivery plans, the NAO declared. IDPs only last 12 months, then have to be renewed. Currently applicants have to go in person to a Post Office branch with their full driving licence, a passport-sized photo and another proof of ID like a passport.  The watchdog said the Department for Transport only formally notified the Post Office of contract changes two months ago, and then only in outline form. Since then, the Post Office has been working on its detailed delivery plans for submission to the DVLA and the Department, the NAO said. The NAO makes clear the rise in IDPs will only happen if there is no agreement to ensure mutual recognition of UK and EU driving licences. But it comes as both the EU and the UK ramp up preparations for a no deal Brexit after a week of Tory civil war and deadlock in Parliament.

Bekki Reece says conditions became so bad her 12-year-old daughter suffered a nose bleed, while her one-year-old girl was fanned by other travellers as temperatures soared to about 37C. The 32-year-old, from Biddulph, Staffordshire, says there was no air-con or water available as the plane sat waiting. Bekki, partner Shane Davies and her three young children were among 300 passengers trapped on the packed jet at Lanzarote airport.  She told the Stoke Sentinel conditions caused some to faint, suffer panic attacks and vomit as the smell of aviation fuel filled the cabin.   The family had been due to fly back with Thomas Cook to Manchester at 8.20pm on Thursday, July 5 but arrived at the airport only to be told they faced a two-and-a-half hour delay because of technical issues.   Bekki, who was also joined on the flight by mum Deb Dale and step-dad Michael Dale, said: “We got to the check-in and were told it would be a two-and-a-half hour delay but then at the gate it said three. We eventually boarded the plane but when we got on it was stifling - Shane said he felt sick. “After two hours my eldest daughter was having nose bleeds and my youngest looked as though she had just got out the bath because she was dripping with sweat. Passengers were using their safety cards to fan her down. It was really scary. She was so floppy and struggling to keep awake. “They opened the doors but there was a lot of commotion and after about three hours a young girl fainted. “I was worried for all our health - it was unbearable.

To Eleanor Stollery, her mum and dad, Kelly and Tim, look like something out of a horror film with black holes for eyes and slits for mouths. Their bodies appear like moving shadows and having lost her sight so young, she sadly no longer remembers their features. But despite being plunged into a frightening world dreamt up by the likes of J.K.Rowling, the happy schoolgirl is an inspiration to other sick children with her incredible outlook on life. I get on fine, chirps Eleanor, a big fan of the fantasy series. The only problem is when I accidentally bang into doors.  The brave schoolgirl, from Hampton, London, lost her sight in 2015 age four after being diagnosed with an inoperable cancerous brain tumour known as a Hypothalamic Low-Grade Glioma. Eleanor quickly underwent an 18-month regime of extensive chemotherapy, but sadly her eyesight was ravaged. Earlier this year, the Stollery family received a second blow when an MRI scan showed both a small growth of the large inoperable tumour, and a second, smaller tumour in a different location. The new lesion is currently growing at a rate of 1mm a month and the seven-year-old is now undergoing further chemotherapy.  But despite her disability and ongoing treatment, Eleanor is a normal little girl. I\u0027m biased but she is infectious, dad Tim says. She is a little comedian and makes us laugh every day. We try to treat her as normally as possible - we don\u0027t put her on a pedestal because we don\u0027t want her to end up being an entitled child. She\u0027s wise beyond her years and such a positive spirit. She goes to a mainstream school and loves to listen to audio books. We think she maybe gets a little bit anxious when something new is about to begin but mainly, Eleanor just cracks on.  The lively seven-year-old is now officially registered as severely sight impaired (blind) as the cables that connect her eyes to the back of her brain are damaged beyond repair. Unless medical science catches up, she will never regain her eyesight. Dad Tim says: It is very difficult to explain what Eleanor can see. She sees light and dark, she sees huge objects but no detail, she sees changes in floor coverings if they go from light to dark or visa versa. But she can\u0027t really interpret colour or follow objects. Some days Eleanor seems to see better than others, but what she might see is so limited it is of no use to her in day to day life. She says she can see our pupils against the white eyeball but the rest of the face is dark. It sounds like something out of a horror film, like a Death Eater or a Dementor from Harry Potter. That\u0027s her reality and although we would be scared of it, she isn\u0027t.  As for Eleanor, she only encounters one obstacle at school. Eleanor says: People ask me how I do it but the only problem if someone leaves a cupboard door open and I bang into it. The cupboard doors at my school are white and whatever is behind it is white too so I can\u0027t see it\u0027s there at all. I can see very big shapes but not when they are the same colour next to each other and if I haven\u0027t seen it before then I don\u0027t know what it is. I can see the shapes on their [my parents\u0027] faces and they have a line for their mouth and black dots for their eyes. If I get really close up I can just about tell the colour of their eyes. Most importantly, nothing stops Eleanor from having fun and feeding her curious mind. I can read braille and I love art and maths, she tells . Sometimes I get a bit of paper at home and make up equations. I solve them all myself. And my best friend at school is Romily because she\u0027s fun. When I say something really funny we both have a real laugh about it.  Eleanor\u0027s deep love of Harry Potter might be why she is unfazed by her dementor parents. I really love Harry Potter and my favourite character is Ron because he\u0027s so funny, she says. I\u0027ve listened to both of the audio book collections [one is narrated by Stephen Fry and the other by Jim Dale] and watched all of films with audio description over and over. I also went to both parts of the Cursed Child with audio description at the theatre. It was amazing. When I was there, in the middle of it, I couldn\u0027t believe it was happening and it felt like it was going to go on forever but now it feels like it went really quick and at the end I wanted to do it all over again. Before the show started I got to do a touch tour where you feel some of the objects and the characters. It\u0027s really exciting. Hagrid held me up in the arena. Carefree and laughing, Eleanor jokes: I will like Harry Potter until I\u0027m 500-years-old. I might have a portrait of Harry Potter put in my grave when I die. Eleanor is now undergoing a long journey of chemotherapy and other treatments for possibly well into her teenage years. Her type of tumour will never go away unless a cure is found. Along with Eleanor\u0027s mum Kelly Gurney and a huge team of supporters, Tim wants to raise awareness of the early symptoms of a brain tumour. If not for the family\u0027s persistence early on, Eleanor\u0027s could have been missed.

The pink vehicle, from the \u0027Pork Lovers Tour\u0027, has been parked in Bristol\u0027s main shopping area in a bid to promote Spanish pork products.  Featuring a giant heart-shaped snout and pigs\u0027 ears, it has led to an impromptu protest by vegan activists in Broadmead, Bristol Live reports.  Shoppers are being invited on board the bus to taste freebies, learn pork cooking techniques and receive nutrition advice.  Activities include workshops, cooking presentations and Spanish ham slicing demonstrations. However, the pro-pork vehicle drew the attention of the city\u0027s vegan community yesterday, with activists protesting against it. Onlookers described how there were angry exchanges between staff on the conspicuous \u0027Pork Lovers\u0027 bus and the protesters. They also said that Eat A Pitta employees from the nearby kiosk started handing out free falafel in support of the vegans. One of the protesters, named Jasmine, said of the pork promotional event: We are here because we are protesting this monstrosity.  It\u0027s basically propaganda telling people they can have pork imported from Spain for whatever reason that seems like a luxury, who knows. She went on to claim: Essentially we want to expose the truth in that welfare of pigs when they are kept on British farms is vile. They are not stunned or killed humanely, if that even exists, they are gassed and normally they are starved for 24 to 72 hours before they are killed. Mounted police officers had to intervene and calm both sides down. Jasmine continued: We are trying to expose there is no good that can come from this. Pork is a type one carcinogenic. There is no need for us to consume meat.

I see it in her face and I see it in her smile. I\u0027ve seen her smile for years. I know her smile. I don\u0027t like the one I\u0027m seeing now. This one isn\u0027t even a stage smile - this is a pained smile. Sharon Osbourne has accused Thomas Markle of being an alcoholic who needs to \u0027get clean\u0027. Appearing on an American talk show, she urged him to stop humiliating Meghan and stop drinking.

The club at Ysgol Y Berllan Deg primary school in Llanedeyrn, Cardiff, has limited spaces for next year.  Mums told Wales Online how important it was to them that their child was included with one saying I can’t risk not getting a place, I don’t have a plan B.  The breakfast club is a government scheme aimed at providing young children with the opportunity of receiving a free, healthy breakfast at school each day. For many parents with a long commute it is vital as it allows them to drop their kids off early and get to work on time. The school opened its yearly applications for the next school year today and some parents were so worried about missing out they queued through the night outside the school gates.  At the front of the queue was Annett Farrow from Carmarthen, whose grandchild goes to the school. “We have been on the road since 1am and got here at 3am,” she said. “My son and daughter-in-law are on holiday so we had to come. If it gets them a place it will have been worth it. “We have bought biscuits and crisps - the only problem is the toilets. We have been using the toilets in the hotel opposite.”  For some parents like Leanne Taylor, who has been in her chair since 3.30am, there is no backup plan. She said: “I have two children, one of whom is starting in reception in September. “I had to do this last year when it did rain a bit. I had only moved into my house two days before and I didn’t have internet. I planned to bring my laptop and do some work while I waited. The police turned up and asked what I was doing.”  According to Leanne there is no other option for her if she wants to maintain her career. She said: “For some it is essential. I work opposite Tredegar House and I drive in. If I drop them off at 8.30 I won’t be getting into work until 10 because of the traffic. “If I didn’t have this I would not be able to go to work- I can’t risk not getting a place, I don’t have a plan B. “It is a really good school and I don’t think there is a fairer way to do it. “To do it you literally have to walk in and hand a form in. They then write what number you were in the queue on the form. “The ones that are here first are the ones that need it most. It gets longer and earlier because the people who did not get a place last year will get here earlier this year.” Another parent, who did not want to be named, said that in previous years it had been slightly different.

First up is Zulkernan Mahmood, who raked in \u0026pound1.2million a year with his intimidating sales tactics. Despite boasting of a “seamless and problem-free installation every time” on his website, customers were left with shoddy doors and windows fitted by incompetent workers who sometimes left a trail of damage. Mahmood’s reps got customers to pay in full before installation by removing existing windows and demanding the balance “with the implication that the replacement windows would not be installed unless payment was made”, as trading standards officers put it. Other nasty tactics included: *Taking unauthorised payments from customers’ bank cards. When challenged the firm said this was to pay VAT – despite not being VAT registered. *Leaving jobs unfinished. *Ignoring complaints. *Failing to provide safety glass in locations where it was required by law. *Lying about belonging to an industry accreditation body.  Boxing fan Mahmood spent some of the money he made flying to Las Vegas to watch Floyd Mayweather, posting the pictures on Twitter, plus flights to Istanbul and Paris, private school fees and designer clothes. The 30-year-old from Bradford admitted fraud and consumer protection offences following a joint operation by police, trading standards and adult social care workers in West Yorkshire. He was given a suspended 15-month jail sentence and ordered to pay almost \u0026pound65,000 in costs and compensation.  Mike Walsh, prosecuting on behalf of West Yorkshire Trading Standards, told Leeds crown court that damning evidence found during raids on his home and business included a text message in which the shyster wrote: “We’ve become a complete cowboy outlet”. After the trial Linda Davis, head of the West Yorkshire Financial Exploitation and Abuse Team, said: “This case highlights the unfair and fraudulent \u0026shypractices that rogue traders will use against unsuspecting, often \u0026shyvulnerable, consumers.”  Mahmood traded as UKHI Limited, UK Home Improvements and Energy Efficient Double Glazing and previously worked for double glazing giant Safestyle UK, which brings me to the second case. On Monday, in another prosecution brought by West Yorkshire trading standards, Safestyle was fined \u0026pound120,000 in a trial that exposed a dreadful range of bullying, cheating ploys to get work.  In one of the most damning \u0026shyjudgments I’ve heard in a consumer case, Judge Robert Moore told \u0026shySheffield crown court that for two years the firm did not control its staff. “The offences were literally all over the country,” he said. “They frequently involved preying on the more vulnerable and often elderly. “There were lies and forceful calls deliberately wearing customers down. Faulty work was left \u0026shyunrepaired and there was unpleasantness and perseverance.” In one case the rep challenged a reluctant customer to a fight.  In another, when a homeowner objected to an unsolicited visit and pointed to her “No cold-callers” door sticker, the rep said that this did not apply to him “as it didn’t say no cold-calling from Safestyle UK”. An 88-year-old woman was \u0026shypressurised into giving her phone number by a rep who stood with “pen and paper repeating her dialling code”. And an 84-year-old man was told there would be “trouble” if he cancelled after phoning to complain about the cost. Safestyle UK, a trading name of HPAS Limited, admitted 13 unfair trading offences on day two of the trial. The court heard that it now has a new chief executive, Michael Gallacher, and a new chief financial officer. The judge said: “They have a lot to do.” "},{"url":null,"title":"poppi worthingtons dad says nothing","story":"NewsPoppi Worthington’s dad says he has ‘nothing to hide’ after police discover missing laptop he was watching porn onPaul Worthington was not charged following a police investigation into the death of his 13-month-old daughter\u0026nbspShareByNeil MurphyTom DavidsonOnline Reporter06:14, 19 JUL 2018Updated07:20, 19 JUL 2018NewsPoppi Worthington died in December 2012 (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPoppi Worthington\u0027s dad says he has \u0027nothing to hide\u0027 after Cumbria police discovered a missing laptop he used to watch porn the night before she died. Paul Worthington, 50, was arrested - but not charged - in connection with the tragic death of the 13-month-old toddler who was found suffocated in his bed in 2012. Investigators believe the laptop, which was seized along with several other items, could hold vital clues about Poppi\u0027s final hours. Poppi\u0027s auntie Tracy Worthington, has spoken with brother Paul following the discovery of the missing laptop and says that he has no questions to answer. She told The Sun Online: “He has always been absolutely truthful to the police about what he was doing the night before Poppi died. “He told them he was watching adult porn, but that isn’t illegal. If he hadn’t told the police he was watching porn, they would have been none the wiser. He didn’t need to tell them that. “He has nothing to hide.  The laptop was passed onto the neighbour of Mr Worthington, 39-year-old Wayne Roebuck, following Poppi\u0027s death. Roebuck claims that he gave the laptop to an unnamed man who has since moved away from the area. A Cumbria Police spokesman said: The Constabulary can confirm that during the course of their enquiries officers have recovered a number of items, including a laptop. The laptop is subject to meticulous forensic examination, by specialist officers, to determine whether it is relevant to potential enquiries concerning Poppi Worthington. Worthington is now living off handouts from friends and family and is too frightened to return to his hometown of Barrow-in-Furness, it was revealed. Younger sister Tracy said: “He won’t ever come back here, as some idiot who doesn’t know the real story will read a snippet somewhere and he would be at serious risk of being knifed or something.  “He just won’t put himself in that sort of danger.” Paul Worthington has previously avoided court action - despite a coroner and a family court judge both ruling he sexually assaulted the youngster in his bed hours before she died.

But this year one store is letting chocolate lovers fill their own tins with only their favourite sweet treats. Shoppers will be able to fill up a 1.2kg tin in store from late September until December 23 at pick and mix stations in John Lewis. There is a catch, however. Each tin has to have four different flavours, so a tin containing just purple ones isn\u0027t allowed.  To make the tin even more special, customers can pay an extra \u0026pound3 to get a personalised lid with their \u0027street name\u0027 on. The special tins are nearly double the price at \u0026pound12, whereas the standard chocolate tins are \u0026pound7.50 RRP. Harry Wallop, a consumer affairs correspondent, was one of the first to take to Twitter and report on the new pick and mix stations. Others took to social media to share their excitement over the brand new treat. Laura from Birmingham said that she would marry someone if they gave her a personalised tin. Quality Street has been a firm favourite across the country after being launched by Nestle in 1936.

These will maximise your comfort no end and could turn a great festival into an amazing one you\u0027ll never forget! Before you set off   You\u0027ll want to avoid traffic queues where possible, so investing in a TomTom GO 6200 ,\u0026pound270, (save \u0026pound69) could be just the answer. Add real-time traffic information to the navigational benefits of a sat nav (smartphone required for this feature), and you\u0027re going to get to your destination quickly, without getting lost and wasting valuable partying time stuck in a traffic jam.

Take the right kind of tent  When you arrive at a festival you\u0027ll want to get stuck straight in to the action, not spending ages pitching a complicated tent. The good news is that there are lots of options to make the whole camping experience a lot simpler.  Some have inflatable sections to get them pitched in faster times. But even better, and more affordable, is the Urban Escape 4 Person Quick Up Dome Tent , seen above, which is now on offer at Halfords for \u0026pound60, (save \u0026pound90).  This glorious invention has integrated poles which make it a doddle to put up. It\u0027s also got impressive waterproofing and a double skin design to keep the inside condensation-free.  Don\u0027t forget too that while tent pegs are a usually easy to hammer in with any blunt object you have to hand, it\u0027s a lot harder getting them out again. Take the Halfords Tent Peg Extractor along to help, it\u0027s now only \u0026pound2 (save \u0026pound3) after all!    You\u0027ll also need somewhere to snuggle up once the fun is over for the day.

Here\u0027s a bright idea   The Halfords 24 LED Tent Light , above, is now \u0026pound6, was \u0026pound15 (save \u0026pound9), and is designed to be hung in your tent to provide a decent level of illumination. You can dim it too, switching between 8, 16 or 24 LEDs, so it\u0027s ideal for tents both big and small.  The best option for being out and about is a torch you can wear on your head. This allows you to walk around and keep both hands free. The advantages of this will become crystal clear when you reach the toilet in pitch darkness.  The Energizer 7 LED Head Light Torch , \u0026pound19.99, is water resistant to IPX4 standards, making it ideal for outdoor use in any weather.  Take food for your first night  While taking food for the whole weekend might not be practical, you could certainly cater for the night of your arrival. Pack some sausages, mushrooms and beans and get yourself an all-day breakfast on the go before heading out to party until actual breakfast.  The Halfords Complete Cookset Pack is now half price at \u0026pound25 and has everything you need. A compact stove, pots pans and storage for leftovers too. A handy carry bag makes it perfect for carrying with you. You\u0027ll need to get a gas canister too - \u0026pound2 each, or four for \u0026pound5.    You\u0027ll make all sorts of friends if you add a kettle too and if you handle it right you might turn a profit. 50p for a cuppa sounds very reasonable…  Don\u0027t run out of battery!  You\u0027ll be needing to use your phone a lot to tell everyone on social media what a great time you\u0027re having. Unfortunately, there aren\u0027t many places to plug in your charger in a festival field.  So you\u0027ll be needing the Juice Power Station , priced \u0026pound30, which will charge an iPhone X about four times.  The 2.4 amp output also means that it will charge your phone quickly, putting it on while you have an afternoon nap will have the phone fully charged before it\u0027s time to watch the next act. To get the best battery life on your phone have a look for a low power mode too. These often disable sync for your email, social media, etc. This won\u0027t really affect the functionality of the phone but it will save power. If you\u0027re super-low on juice then flick on aeroplane mode to eek out a little longer. Now get trollied!

The latest hot spell comes after the Met Office said the UK could see a record-breaking summer if temperatures stay above average.  With the start of the school holidays , it is time to bring out the barbecues again.  But although much of the country will stay dry today, some much needed rain is expected to reach Scotland by the afternoon and possible showers could hit in eastern England. The rain will move south into northern England, Wales and the Midlands overnight and hot conditions in the South East could even trigger thunderstorms tomorrow afternoon. A Met Office yellow weather warning is in place for the region between 2pm and 11.59pm.  Met Office meteorologist Dean Hall said: The last heatwave ended with a temperature breakdown, but it looks as though we are going back into the heat again. The heat will be building into the weekend and early next week. But with the increasing heat and humidity there\u0027s always a chance of one or two thunderstorms. Mr Hall said most of the country would enjoy warm and dry conditions with the hot, sunny weather predicted to last into next week when top temperatures could reach 31C.  It\u0027s a very warm weekend with plenty of fine, dry weather around, with the exception being a little bit of cloud in western Scotland and Northern Ireland. he continued. But otherwise a good deal of fine, dry weather and very warm if not hot conditions. Conditions have been unusually dry, with the UK having just 47mm of rain so far, making it the driest start to summer in modern records which date back to 1961.  The Met Office says this summer is set to beat 1976 to be the hottest summer since records began 108 years ago in 1910.   It said: “Temperatures this summer are remarkable. If the rest of the summer is average, 2018 will certainly rank in the top 10 warmest summers on record - and if we continue to see above-average temperatures, it could well be record breaking. “June 1 to July 16 had an average daily maximum temperature across the country of 20.9C. The average daily maximum in the hottest summer on record, 1976, was 21C. “And if the rest of the summer was average, we would also be in the top five sunniest summers on record, and in the top 10 driest summers of all time.” "},{"url":null,"title":"airbus beluga xl airbus flight","story":"News\u0027Whale in the sky\u0027 makes maiden voyage as Airbus Beluga XL departs Toulouse sending smiling giant soaring through airThe impressive aircraft, designed to resemble a Beluga whale, took to the skies as part of a 10-month test to see if the jet will be worthy of entering passenger service\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAbigail O\u0027Leary10:41, 19 JUL 2018Updated10:42, 19 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plane branded a \u0027whale in the sky\u0027 has made its maiden voyage as the Airbus Beluga XL departed Toulouse this morning. The impressive aircraft, designed to resemble a Beluga whale, took to the skies as part of a 10-month test to see if the jet will be worthy of entering passenger service. Airbus plan to eventually bring the air cargo craft to Broughton in North Wales. Complete with a whale mouth and eyes on each side of the nose, the Beluga XL will replace the current five plane Beluga ST fleet . The new jet can carry six more tonnes and is 20ft longer, while being powered by two Rolls-Royce Trent 700 high bypass turbofan aircraft engines. It also has an enlarged fuselage “bubble” section that is six metres longer and one metre wider than on the Beluga ST.  The maiden flight is expected to take around three and a half hours before landing back at Toulouse. Tim Orr, head of branding at Airbus, said: The six designs we proposed for consideration by employees respected our brand identity while running from the conventional to the unconventional, even adding a touch of fun.

Astonishing video shot during a street demonstration in Paris shows security advisor Alexandra Benalla attacking a young man he slaps round the head and woman who he grabs by the neck. The fallout which has emerged since the video became public has led to a political scandal - with opponents of French president accusing him of trying to cover up the attacks. There are now calls for deputy chief of staff Benalla, who is in his mid-30s, to be imprisoned after what happened at the demonstration on May 1 – the country\u0027s traditional day of street action. The event this year saw hundreds of thousands campaigning across France against Mr Macron’s employment reforms - and it\u0027s now transpired Benalla was in the thick of it.  The video footage shows deputy chief of staff at the Elysee Palace had donned a police helmet, despite not being authorised to do so. He can clearly be seen first of all grabbing a young woman by the neck. Benalla then turns his attention to a bearded Left-wing activist who has been apprehended by gendarmes. Then burly Benalla pulls the man away from the police, and starts slapping him around the head. When other demonstrators start shouting at Benalla, he looks scared of being identified behind his visor, before slinking off to a caf\u0026eacute.  Alexis Corbiere, an MP and spokesman for former far-Left presidential candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon, said he ‘asked for penal sanctions’ against a ‘colleague of Macron who disguised himself as a police officer to commit violence.’ And Paris barrister Raquel Garrido said: ‘I hope that prosecutors have already initiated criminal proceedings against Alexandre Benalla, head of security of Emmanuel Macron. In addition to violence, it is question of usurpation..’ According to Le Monde, which broke the story in France, there are other incriminating videos to go with the ones already posted on platforms including Twitter.  Benalla refused to comment, but Mr Macron’s chief of staff said: ‘Alexandre Benalla had warned me two days earlier [before the demonstration] that he wanted to take part in an operation with the police to see how a large demonstration was handled. ‘He asked me for permission, I gave it to him, but making it clear that he was an observer. ‘The day after the demonstration, I was informed by a colleague that Mr Benalla had been recognised in the field as being involved in law enforcement operations, and I saw the videos. ‘I summoned the same day, I asked him if it was him.’ When Benalla said yes, Mr Macron himself called for Benalla to be suspended from his duties for 15 days up until May 19, but the incident was otherwise hushed up.

Daddy, it hurts after being repeatedly raped by different men as her mother watched, it has been alleged. Azzie Watson is accused of taking her daughter to a home as many as 10 times to let two men sexually assault her, police say. And the youngster was raped around five times, it has been reported. She contracted a sexually transmitted infection and had amphetamines in her system, according to medical records. Watson, 25, admitted she was involved in sexual activity with the men. Neither of whom are thought to be the girl\u0027s biological father, despite her calling them daddy. The toddler\u0027s mum, from Kansas, has now been charged with child abuse and endangerment after the horrific abuse was uncovered.  She has since described herself “a coward” for what happened, reports Kansas City Star. It was after the little girl and her younger brother were put in care their foster parent saw something \u0027she’d never seen before\u0027. As she tried to change the toddler\u0027s diaper she says the youngster cried: “Daddy hurt me. Daddy, stop being mean. Daddy, it hurts.” The foster parent then contacted police. Both the little girl and her one-year-old brother had scarred and mutilated feet embedded with sharp metal objects, thought to be from walking around without shoes in a littered house and garage. Meanwhile, a 43-year-old man, Charles Green, described as Watson’s boyfriend, has also been charged with two counts of endangering the welfare of a child. Court documents say Watson\u0027s boyfriend recorded her talking about repeatedly taking her daughter to a house where the child was raped about five times.

I really hope they take the message back to their own communities.”In 2015, Angus Council agreed a policy which banned the release of balloons and sky lanterns from council property and also at events endorsed by the authority.Farm animals often mistake the balloons for food while birds and marine animals become entangled in them.Ms Bell said: “We completely understand people’s need to grieve or celebrate and would encourage ways that look after the environment.“The main message we want to get across is – don’t let go of balloons, whether they are helium or ordinary, or sky lanterns which can do massive damage to the environment.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee boss mccann wants to see physical sofien moussa in between the posts","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann has urged striker Sofien Moussa to get himself “between the posts” so he can add goals to his all-round play for Dundee.The Dark Blues front man failed to inspire confidence among the Dens Park support for much of last season.A late flurry of goals saw him finish with 12 in all competitions.And this campaign, he’s already started towards bettering that tally with two goals in the 4-0 win over Stirling Albion on Saturday.That’s despite a howler of a miss with the score at 0-0 before he changed his boots and 10 minutes later knocked in the openerNeil said: “I don’t know if the other boots were a wee bit tight or whatever but it was a super finish for his second one.“He knew I wasn’t happy with the first miss but his control of a great ball from Gense Kusunga was superb and it was a fine finish.

We just captured events and places that we thought were significant,” he said.“There are photos of people, of events, the arts, dance activities, things such as the New Year’s Day Dook and a lot of buildings that we thought either were significant or would become significant.“I was given access to Dens Park, for example, because I imagine in 10 years or so it might no longer exist as we know it.“I’m quite surprised at what we’ve been able to achieve.”The Tele was given access to some of the archive and the differences in city life now and then are stark.The 1916 survey features street scenes in the city centre and atop the Hilltown – and couldn’t be any more different from the snaps from 1991.Many of the later images show the city at its post-industrial peak, complete with questionable fashion choices and a City Square yet to be pedestrianised.Red Sky’s modern day survey is packed with sights that are likely to be familiar now – the new railway station entrance under construction, rusted-in tram rails on the Murraygate and dance performances in front of Caird Hall.Rather topically, there are also photos of William Halley’s mill – now reduced to rubble.Alistair Wilson, of Dundee Libraries, said the relevance of these photographic surveys becomes very clear after just a few years, giving people a fresh perspective on a city that might have changed without them really noticing.“The 1991 survey was carried out by Dundee Photographic Society. It and the other surveys act like a social record of how the city was at that time,” he said.“Looking back at 1991, which doesn’t feel that long ago, you can see so many things have changed – the way people dress, the jobs they have, even the cars on the streets.“Once the exhibition finishes the plan is that it will move about so everyone can see it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4f068acbb8a-752x564.jpg ","title":"dundee pet centre has 14 cats needing rehomed can you help","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Scottish SPCA’s Dundee centre is seeking homes for 14 cats.The animal welfare charity is encouraging the public to come along and meet Fifi, Mertle, Tango and their friends in the hope of finding new homes for them.Scottish SPCA Dundee animal rescue and rehoming centre manager Elliot Hay said: “We’re struggling to find homes for these lovely felines, who arrived into our care through no fault of their own.“We are constantly rescuing and taking in more cats so we’re really keen for people who are thinking about getting a new cat to consider rehoming one from us.”Anyone who would like to rehome one of the cats should contact the SSPCA’s Dundee centre on 03000 999999.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/04/08mgjmorr_9734107-863x575.jpg ","title":"dundee supermarket works with autism charity to launch quiet hour for customers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee supermarket is set to introduce a quieter hour in-store for customers who are sensitive to music and other noises associated with busy shops.Morrisons on Afton Way is rolling out the quieter period every Saturday from 9am-10am.The initiative, dreamed up with the support of the National Autistic Society, has been designed to accommodate people with autism who can find the noisy clamour of shops stressful.Morrisons carried out trials in three stores across the UK earlier this year in order to work out what makes shopping stressful for those with autism and to figure out a time that is convenient.During the Quieter Hour, Dundee’s Morrisons store will have its lights dimmed, its music switched off, the frequency of announcements reduced and a reduction in the movement of trolleys and baskets.Checkout beeps and other electrical noises will also be turned down, and the Quieter Hour will be clearly advertised with a poster at the store’s front entrance.Staff are being briefed on the anxieties customers with autism can face when shopping, in order to improve their understanding of the issues.The National Autistic Society said Quieter Hour was “a step in the right direction”.Morrisons Dundee store manager Colin Thomson added: “Our initial trials showed there is a need for a quieter shopping experience.

We trained twice on Friday so there were heavy legs,” he said.“I think we have to play quicker football, especially in the front. We kept the ball too long in the midfield.“And I think it is more important for that, although some people will be disappointed with the result, we look at some of the decisions we made in the game.“We had 1-0 and the game in hand.

year.A total of 4,350 people, representing 4.6% of the working-age population, are claiming – up from 3,355.The figures represent the continuation of a trend which has seen claimant counts rise almost monthly since November, from a low of 3.1% that month.However, in the long term, the number of people signing on has fallen by 10% since the last significant change of Westminster government in 2010.Jane McEwen, work coach team leader at Dundee’s Jobcentre Plus, said this was down to changes in how benefit figures are recorded.“Full service” Universal Credit rolled out in Dundee last November, replacing six “old-style” benefits such as Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA).Families of up to two adults and two children are now processed on the new system and count towards the total number of claimants.This applies even if they aren’t claiming JSA but are looking for work while claiming payments such as housing benefit or tax credits, which now fall under Universal Credit.Jane said: “We issue comparison figures for each year but there’s a caveat with those because we went full service in November. We think that accounts for much of the increase.“It will likely only be in December, or even January next year, that we can start comparing like-for-like.”Local Jobcentres have made efforts to team up with local employers to offer opportunities to those searching for work.Recently, Tayside branches have been working with ABP Food Group in Perth, 2 Sisters Food Group in Coupar Angus and are making inroads with the Scottish Government to recruit for Dundee’s new Social Security Agency.In addition, Jobcentre Plus staff are laid on at the Central Library to help people with “soft skills” such as IT literacy, writing a CV and attending interviews.Jane conceded that Universal Credit, which is self-managed online, had presented issues for those not IT literate.“For those that struggle with this, we will try to help them,” she said.UK employment is at a record high of 75.7%, according to the DWP.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4c5d1fbe2e3-480x564.jpg ","title":"neil mccann hails super stop from keeper jack hamilton on dundee debut","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann hailed the stopping power of new goalie Jack Hamilton as he claimed a debut clean sheet.By the end of their 4-0 victory at Stirling Albion which started their Betfred Cup campaign, the Dark Blues were cruising to victory.However, with the game at 0-0 and 1-0, the League Two side had chances to turn the game their way.Their best effort came from the head of Jason Marr shortly after half-time but his powerful effort was well saved by new boy Hamilton with the keeper up quickly again to stop the rebound.After that Sofien Moussa added his second of the game before debutant Jean Mendy and Craig Wighton goals capped a good start to the season for Dundee.Boss Neil said: “I’m delighted, absolutely delighted.“I said before the game that this was the season started for real now, there’s no more warm-ups.“First of all, you want to win the game and then, afterwards, put on a bit of a show and score some goals so I’m pleased we did that.“Stirling made it really difficult at times and it took a brilliant double stop from big Jack Hamilton, which is exactly why we brought him to the club.

Don’t you f***ing dare sully it with your anti-trans b*******.”Ms Bell, who sits on Angus Council’s children and learning committee, risked igniting a row within the party by saying she was “on it” after a social media user urged officials to “get rid” of Councillor Murray.Ms Bell confirmed she plans to raise concerns officially via the party’s escalation process but declined to say anything more when approached for comment.Dundee City Council leader John Alexander has repeatedly backed his children’s convener, despite a growing list of embarrassments that include a row with a chaplain in a school playground and being called out for “blatant sexism” by MSP Kezia Dugdale.Labour group leader Kevin Keenan said of Councillor Alexander: “John should be asking himself whether Gregor is the right person to stay on.“I was copied in on a letter from a member of the council staff with screen grabs of Gregor’s tweets and I think certainly there are a number of people who are unhappy.“The administration needs to make its mind up. It’s lived with blunder after blunder, the question now is whether this is one too many.”It is understood SNP colleagues will give Councillor Murray a dressing down in the coming days but they have not yet intimated any plans to remove the councillor as children and families convener.Depute leader of the Dundee SNP group Willie Sawers said it would be discussed once Councillor Murray returns from holiday.“This language is clearly inappropriate and Councillor Murray has acknowledged this,” he added.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4f0793923bf-771x564.jpg ","title":"stirling albion or celtic its all the same to dundee new boy jean mendy","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn his very short time at Dundee, Senegalese striker Jean Mendy has already shown he can get fans off their seats at Dens Park this season.And he plans to continue doing that – as well as getting goals – whether he’s playing against Stirling Albion or Celtic, it’s all the same to him.He told the Tele: “I don’t know the teams at the moment!“For me, playing Stirling is like playing against Celtic, it’s the same for me – I just play my game, it doesn’t matter, and try to win every game.”The 28-year-old was delighted to start his career in dark blue with a goal after he knocked in a good strike from the edge of area as his new team began the season with a morale-boosting 4-0 victory at Stirling Albion.“It was good and we won of course – it’s very important to start winning,” Mendy added.“It was a little bit hot, I think, on the pitch on Saturday, we could feel it.“The performance was good, can be better you know, it was the first game but it was good to get the confidence with this game.“It was great for the team to score a lot of goals and we have shown we have people who can score.“I was pleased to get the goal, I got the chance and I put it in.“It was perfect for me to start with a goal and good for my confidence so I’m very happy to start like this.”Mendy joined the club from Belgian top-flight side Lokeren where he struggled to make an impact.That was after piling in the goals in the Norwegian lower leagues.Back in 2012, he banged in 27 goals in 25 league games for Elverum in the third tier before 27 in 52 in the next tier for Kristiansund. A move up to the top flight only brought a return of six in 23 for Sandefjord before returning to Kristiansund and then getting the big move to Belgium.Manager Neil McCann said he’d been keeping an eye on Mendy’s progress after missing out on him when he departed Norway.He’s finally got his man and the forward is delighted to be at Dundee, even if he’s not spent much time in the city with the club spending a week-long training camp in Portugal.He said: “I’ve enjoyed my time so far, it’s a good club with good players, too, and I think this year will be a good one.“Portugal was a lot of training. That sort of preparation is normal and it was good for us but you feel it when we played the games over there.“We didn’t get the wins in the friendlies, maybe one win against Sunderland but we lost the last two but they were only friendlies – more important is winning the games when the season begins, like Saturday.“It was very good to show we are ready.“There are a few new players, myself as well, and it’s very important for us to get together with the team and start to know each other in training, talk together and know how we all play.“It’s looking good. We’ll obviously continue to work more but I think the season will be good.”After starting off Group D with victory, Mendy and his new team-mates take on Dunfermline at home in front of the television cameras on Sunday.Even if he doesn’t know much about his opponents just yet, Mendy knows the Dundee fans will be expecting a good show from their side and he’s hoping to add to his goal tally.“I’m looking forward to my first home game this weekend.“That will be very important in front of our supporters.“Of course, we want to play a good game, put on a show for the fans and win the game, too.“We are going for a victory.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/Gjen_Lochee_Roadworks.JPG-846x564.jpg ","title":"too much at one time locals claim roadworks on busy dundee street is adding 20 minutes to short journey","story":"\t\t\t\t\tResidents living beside a busy Dundee street are fuming over new roadworks which have left them facing lengthy diversions.They spoke out after Coupar Angus Road was shut to southbound traffic from the South Road roundabout, down Lochee High Street bypass to the junction with Loon’s Road, from July 10.It is the second round of closures for the area, after a section of the same road was closed for a number of weeks.Residents have complained, saying that the work has added up to 20 minutes to their regular journeys.They claim a diversion sign was placed on the road – but had been removed and was now in the nearby Lidl car park.Taxi driver Jim Leaburn, 68, said he was being criticised by customers for taking longer routes to avoid the closure.He added: “They have done too much here at one time. People get in the taxi and they ask ‘why are you going this way?’ and you try to explain but they think you are at it.”James Montgomery, 58, a labourer who lives alongside the road, said: “Getting from A to B is an absolute nightmare just now.“You need to travel twice the distance owing to the diversion.”Councillor Alan Ross, who represents the Lochee ward, said he empathised with locals – but added that the work was essential.He said: “I know that it is frustrating – I am a driver myself.“I share everyone’s frustrations because it has been difficult to get around the area for a while but maybe people can look at planning ahead or working around them.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “These major roadworks will be completed as soon as possible and the project is still within its three-week programme.\u0026#8220We apologise for any inconvenience that has been caused.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4f3de751df8-e1531927696691-795x564.jpg ","title":"wheelchair user left stranded on platform by broken lift at new dundee station","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA former MP who uses a wheelchair was left stranded on the platform of Dundee’s brand new train station after the lift broke down.Dame Anne Begg was visiting Dundee from her home in Aberdeen for a meeting.As she arrived at the multi-million-pound station, she was approached by members of staff who told her the only accessible lift had broken down.Dame Anne was born with the rare genetic condition Gauchers disease, which causes her bones to break regularly, and has used a wheelchair since 1984. Initially, staff offered her the opportunity to continue her journey through to Leuchars, from where she would then be driven by taxi to her destination.But due to the short time between her arrival in Dundee and the start of her meeting, she said that alternative was unworkable. As a result of not being able to leave the station, the former Aberdeen South Labour MP said she had no choice but to catch the next train north, missing her appointment.Dame Anne said she was now concerned about provision for disabled people’s access at the new station.She said: “Someone told me it was the second time in the station’s opening week the lift has been out of order. I am quite concerned about how disabled people and those who struggle with stairs and escalators are supposed to be able to leave the platform at this brand new station if the lift breaks. There does not seem to be any proper contingency.”A ScotRail spokesman said: “We’re very sorry to Dame Anne and any other customers who were affected by the broken lift which has now been repaired.“When things go wrong, we endeavour to put them right – which is why we provide alternative accessible transport for customers when they are unable to access our stations.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the

What will happen is that one person turns up and uses it and then another and another.\"We have had one wee lad learn to ride his bike here as he was too frightened to learn anywhere else. We have had people playing Frisbee.\"A lot of people from the Highland Council offices have being coming here for lunch and Cheshire House have twice been here with a group of their people.\"Many have said they have been here for events but find it is a completely different place when it is a piece of grass.

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Thursday 19 Jul 2018 12:35

He showed exactly what he is capable of in the latter part of the league campaign when he played a vital role in our post-split games, during which we were undefeated.”Ball made his Reds debut against Hearts at Murrayfield, coming in on the right side of defence for suspended Shay Logan.His minutes on the pitch increased towards the end of last season, and with him in front of the back four, Aberdeen only conceded one goal in five post-split games – against Rangers at Pittodrie.One of those games was a 1-0 win over champions Celtic at Parkhead.Ball, who made 19 appearances last term, may not have long to wait for the first start of his second spell – as English Championship West Bromwich Albion visit Pittodrie tomorrow night.The game is the Reds’ final pre-season friendly before they welcome Premier League Burnley for the first leg of their Europa League second qualifying round tie a week today.Ball, who started his career at Tottenham Hotspur and has also had loan spells at Cambridge United, Rangers, and after signing for Rotherham in 2016, Peterborough United, thinks a fast Dons start can set the tone for the new campaign.After the two Burnley games, which could see Aberdeen take a step closer to the lucrative Europa League group stage, they open their Premiership campaign against the Gers at home on August 5.Ball said: “Burnley play in the Premiership and it is going to be a tough challenge but we will try to get the win.“The first three games are tough but there will be tough games all season and if we can get out there flying it can set us up for the season.“It is important we still have the core of the team which won those games to secure second place and we know what is required.”Meanwhile, one member of the Dons squad who looks set to exit before the start of the competitive matches is striker Adam Rooney.Rooney, 30, has been offered £4,000 a week by English National League side Salford City, with the move now imminent.The fifth-tier team, who are bankrolled by members of Manchester United’s Class of 92, Gary and Phil Neville, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, as well as billionaire Peter Lim, will have to pay a fee for the Irishman, who has two years left on his Pittodrie contract.However, Rooney, who has netted 88 goals since signing in January 2014, had been expected to complete his move to Graham Alexander’s team yesterday.He found himself on the bench for parts of last term as McInnes used Stevie May and Sam Cosgrove upfront instead.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"rooney completes move from aberdeen to salford city","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAdam Rooney has completed his move from Aberdeen to Salford City for an undisclosed fee, the clubs have announced.The striker had scored 88 goals for the Dons since signing in January 2014, and was the first Red since Joe Harper to score more than 20 goals in three consecutive campaigns.He found his minutes on the pitch reduced last season with the arrival of Stevie May and Sam Cosgrove.A Salford spokesman said: \u0026#8220Salford City agreed an undisclosed fee with Aberdeen to bring Adam Rooney to the Peninsula Stadium.\u0026#8220It’s a fantastic signing and further indication, if any was needed, that the Ammies mean business yet again.\u0026#8220We’d like to extend a warm welcome to Adam as the club enters yet another exciting chapter, this time in the National League.\u0026#8221Dons boss Derek McInnes said: \u0026#8220We wish Adam all the very best with his new venture and it is always with a heavy heart when you lose a good player who is also a really good person.\u0026#8220Since I signed Adam four and a half years ago, he has given us nothing but good value and has been a fantastic boy to work with.\u0026#8221\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"rooney thanks red army after aberdeen exit confirmed","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAdam Rooney has thanked the Dons fans for his four-a-half-years of success at Pittodrie after his move to Salford City was confirmed.The 30-year-old told Red TV:  “I can’t thank the fans enough for what they’ve done.“Not just at the games, but in and around the City and out where we are in Ellon, myself and the family have had a great relationship with them and it’s been brilliant. Anywhere we go we’ve been treated well by everyone and it’s been a brilliant club to play for.“Also everyone around the club, it’s not just the players here, have been brilliant with me. It’s a real family club. I think I’ve known everyone’s first name from my time over the years and it’s not as if there’s only four or five people working here. Everyone get’s on well, everyone’s pulling in the same direction whether it’s the football staff, the media team or catering staff, everyone at the club are really good people and it’s been great to get to know them.“It’s not an easy decision when you’ve come so close to the club.“It wasn’t easy, but I just felt my time was coming to an end here and the opportunity came up at Salford. I spoke to my family about and I felt it would be a good opportunity for something new. I wasn’t keen to go somewhere else in Scotland and the move (to Salford) is something I’m really looking forward to taking part in and hopefully making a name for myself there.“I’ve loved my time in the North East and it’s most settled I’ve ever been with my family here and it’s not an easy decision to make, but I just felt was the right time.“There’s lots involved (in moving) it’s not just a case of packing up and going, especially when you’ve got a bit of history here and how good it’s been. I just felt for myself and family it was maybe time to go and try something new.“We went through everything to be honest as you have to consider all things, not just football, you consider everything in your life and we came to a decision that we thought it was a good opportunity and something we thought we’d go for.“The plans and ambition Salford have really intrigues me and where they want to take it. But the other side of that is actually having to leave here.“I certainly wasn’t booted out the door. Unfortunately, in football you feel your time comes to an end at certain periods in your career and you have to move on and we felt it was the right time for everyone.“The reason I came here, and I had other options, was to work with the Gaffer. We’ve had a great relationship and this is the happiest I’ve been at any club throughout my career. It’s been the most enjoyable experience and the Gaffer, Doc and everyone around the club has played a huge part in that.“It’s a brilliant club to play for and hopefully the club’s going to continue to have more success.”Prolific Rooney scored 88 goals in 197 games after signing for Aberdeen in 2014, and was the first Don since Joe Harper to score more than 20 goals for the club for three

painted mural.Residents of Donside Village in Aberdeen have applied their artistic talents to decorating the 60 metre wall in the village square which has been blank for five years.A group of art fans in Donside Village launched Splatter Zone – a project that encourages local artists to submit their work to decorate the canvas.The project was inspired by the Nuart street art festival which saw international and local artists create works on city walls.The group has also planted fruit and vegetables in a bid to create an ‘edible wall’.Project manager Jade Duffield, a communication design student at Robert Gordon University, said anyone is welcome to get involved, particularly those who may have felt held back due to a disability.She said: “We wanted to emphasise everyone can get involved and so residents in the area that have mobility issues or disabilities have been joining in by putting their designs up on the Facebook group.“People who are more able-bodied can then pick up the designs and paint them.”Splatter Zone has also started hosting workshops for children in Donside Village every Saturday.Jade added: “Karen Cargill, who is the community food growing project leader, had the idea of starting an edible wall, so we’ve started planting strawberries, peas, tayberries and raspberries in wellington boots on the wall.“The idea is that, in the future, people are able to just walk past and help themselves.“We’ve also got adult workshops every second Thursday – we’ve just planned a graffiti masterclass for August and we’ll be having a ‘create-a-skate’ session where people can redesign and upcycle skateboards.”Jade, who has also just launched her own business, painted a bird mural which took a week to complete.The 19-year-old said: “The bird was my design

often-gridlocked Haudagain roundabout have got under way with empty properties being torn down in the area.A £30m Scottish Government-backed improvement scheme will see a new link road built to take pressure off the roundabout.The nearby flats have been boarded up for some time as the residents moved out ahead the demolition.Yesterday work started to tear down the homes on Logie Avenue.Dubbed the Haudagain bypass, the project will be financed by Transport Scotland and allow motorists to drive from North Anderson Drive directly to Auchmill Road.The demolition is expected to last around four months before the construction work can start.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “The start of site clearance work at Haudagain sends the clearest message of this Government’s commitment to provide much-needed relief for the north-east community who will welcome real progress on this essential improvement scheme.\u0026#8220This will allow the contractor to hit the ground running and the local community and road users will be able to see visible progress over the coming months.“We will then be ready to start construction when the AWPR is completed in late autumn.”Jenny Laing, co-leader of Aberdeen City Council, said: “We are pleased that Transport Scotland has finally started works associated with the Haudagain roundabout improvements.\u0026#8220This project will complement the AWPR, Third Don Crossing and other transport infrastructure works already undertaken by Aberdeen City Council which are vital to the long-term economic prosperity of the city.”Councillor Neil MacGregor, who represents the Bucksburn area, said: “It’s a funny business, when we’re short of houses there’s houses getting knocked down, but it’s for the greater good. We do need an improvement.“Coming in yesterday at the back of two, even at that time in the middle of the week when the schools are on holiday there’s queues up Auchmill Road. Really the whole problem is that the roundabout itself is far too small in diameter.“Folk are terrified other drivers are going to come round and crash into them.”Mr MacGregor said improvements to the roundabout and traffic flow may help alleviate other issues such as motorists using residential streets as rat runs.He said: “It would be nice to get things moving again. Other cities seem to be able to get their traffic moving about.“This is the key issue. If we could have Auchmill Road moving at a decent rate then you wouldn’t have folk rat running.“You want to give them alternatives but you don’t want the alternatives just to be jam packed and you don’t want to be pushing people through residential areas.“We’ve seen the computer simulations –you can say what you like about computer simulations but they show that it’s going to be wonderful.“There’s scope for it to be much better. This will be an improvement.”Councillor Gordon Graham, who represents the Northfield area, also welcomed the development.He said: “It’s good news. It’s good to see the work is now progressing.”However, Mr Graham said he had doubts over how effective the improvements would be.He added: “When it was first approved I wanted a bigger roundabout. I believe it would have been better.”Bucksburn councillor Avril MacKenzie was delighted to see progression on the “horrendous” roundabout.She said: “I’m glad at long last the work is starting.“That roundabout is pretty horrendous so it can only be a step in the right direction.”Asked if she was confident the work would alleviate the congestion issues in the area, she added: “I certainly hope so.“Anything to improve the flow of traffic.

Stirling Albion on Saturday and Dundee on Tuesday – both at Balmoor – knowing that two wins could take them into the last-16 of the League Cup.Ferry believes the midweek encounter with Championship Dunfermline was good preparation for facing fellow League Two side Stirling on Saturday.He said: “It was good preparation for Stirling on Saturday because it’s still really pre-season so it was good for the boys to get that sort of workout against Dunfermline’s type of players.“It’s also good to see us working as a team against better sorts of players like that.“We won’t underestimate Stirling

could score a goal.“To be 1-0 with five minutes to go and finish 3-0 was a bit harsh on the boys I thought.”Tuesday’s game was also an important one for Ferry personally.It helped get him up to fitness having only returned from Cyprus where his brother was getting married last Wednesday.He added: “I played 30 minutes on Saturday and have been a bit under the weather.“But it was good to get

for cinderella story","story":"\t\t\t\t\tJustin Rose had a message for Sam Locke before the Stonehaven amateur’s maiden Major: believe in the “Cinderella story”.Rose was speaking at Carnoustie ahead of this week’s 147th Open Championship, the tournament where he himself burst on to the scene as an amateur.The Englishman was 17 when he holed from the rough to finish tied for fourth at Royal Birkdale in his first major in 1998 and has gone on to be one of golf’s biggest stars.Rose is the third-ranked player in the world, and won the US Open in 2013, as well as a gold medal at the Rio Olympics in 2016.Of how Scottish Amateur champion Locke should use this week, Rose said: “It’s eye-opening just being here.“And it’s such a thrill, I suppose. I haven’t seen him around, I haven’t met him yet. But I’d say, play as many practice rounds with terrific players as you can.“Guys you can probably learn from and see how they go about their business.“Just ask as many questions as possible, that’ll be a great opportunity to get some insight.“On the golf course, I’m sure he’s obviously a very good player, to be here.“Believe in yourself and, if there’s an opportunity to get on the leaderboard, it’ll be a great experience.“Go hoping for the Cinderella story. It’s possible, we’ve always seen an amateur do well at some points during the week.“Hopefully it can be Sam.”Locke, 19, who is mentored by and works for 1999 Open champion Paul Lawrie, made it into this week’s field through final qualifying, as he attempts to carve out a career for himself in golf.He might be two years older than Rose was when he won the silver medal for leading amateur at Birkdale, but he’s a year younger than 14-time major champion Tiger Woods when he won the medal in 1996.Woods made his major debut the year before at the 1995 Masters.Locke said: “I didn’t know that about Tiger, to be honest. But, again, you go into an event to play the best you can.“At the same time, it’s nice to know a player like that played his first major at the same age as me.“Hopefully if I just keep working hard, playing the best I can, and keep on improving, you never know where it could get you.”Locke will play tomorrow and Friday with American Brandt Snedeker and Australian Cameron Davis, and how he performs will decide whether or not he turns pro.He said: “It depends how I do. I’ve played in a couple of pro events before but nothing of this magnitude.“We’ll see. It’s obviously going to be a really enjoyable week, but it depends how I play – that’ll make my decision.”For the moment, the young north-east hope is just preparing as best he can for what many consider the toughest test in Links golf.Lawrie is at the Open as mentor, but also fulfilling sponsorship commitments and media work, sharing the expertise which saw him bring the Claret Jug back to Aberdeen.Locke said: “Obviously to have any major champion helping you is great.“It’s a bonus he’s won the Open at the course it’s being played. I don’t know how it played in 1999 compared to how it’s going to play this year.“It’s the same lay-out, but to have him helping will be great.”He added: “You prepare for any weather. With links golf more than inland golf, the weather can change quicker.“But you’ve got to prepare for whatever mother nature brings, so you just deal with it and go there ready.“If it stays nice, it’s better to play in but, at the end of the day, we’re all still playing on the same day.“I’m just trying to prepare as I would for another event.“Yes I’m excited, but I’m there to try to play the best I can. So I’m preparing in the normal way and we’ll see what we can do.“Obviously, the best players in the world are in the tournament.“If I play really well, I could be paired with other guys who are playing well at the same time (for the weekend).“Whether that’s any of the top-ranked players in the world, you don’t know, but all these guys are playing in a major championship and they’re all really, really good.“I’m not too bothered who I get.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

All four girls contributed valuable points, with Jemma excelling in the 75 metres sprint recording a time of 12.65 seconds. Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen. This throw ensured fifth place overall for Sophie out of almost 200 girls and the points gained allowed the B team to finish above the A team.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

We thank road users for their patience in advance and encourage them to plan ahead by checking the Traffic Scotland website for real-time journey information.’Real-time journey planning information can be obtained by visiting www.trafficscotland.org or twitter @trafficscotland.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"kyles hammer home a win against caberfeidh","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/07/18, 2:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowMarine Harvest PremiershipKyles Athletic returned to Tighnabruaich for the first time this season and they marked the occasion with a 5-1 win over Caberfeidh.Kyles Athletic boss James Perlich was still without the injured Roddy MacDonald, while Andrew King completed a two-match suspension. His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"shetland comes to cairndow","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/07/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFilm crews were once again spotted in Argyll with the cast of famed BBC series Shetland hot on their heels.After the excitement of Love me to Death filming in Inveraray and Lochgilphead last month, Silverprint Pictures’ made its way to Cairndow to film Shetland\u0026#8217s fifth series this week.The series, which has previously aired on BBC 1, is a dramatisation of the murder mystery novels by Ann Cleeves.Shooting took place on Ardkinglas Estate, inside and outside Ardkinglas House.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"strone point roadworks are completed","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/07/18, 6:51 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA £1.6m project to improve road safety on the A83 at Strone Point at Inveraray has been completed.Around 370m of carriageway has been realigned and a section of the hillside scaled back, widening the road and improving driver visibility.Drainage systems have been upgraded to improve resilience in wet conditions, and new safety barriers and bike guards have also been installed.Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity Michael Matheson said: ‘The section of the A83 at Strone Point on Loch Fyne is single carriageway with a history of fatal and serious accidents.

I’d got it into my head the fact that this talk of \u0026#8220health and safety gone mad\u0026#8221 is just silly. We do actually need these things.\u0026#8216When you went into the history of these mines, you could see that we need every safety and health provision in the book because some very nasty things have happened. Even in very small mines, you can get a tunnel that can collapse or a flash flood and that’s possibly the end of somebody.’Marian added: ‘The many different mining ventures throughout the West Highlands in the past were often much more about lining the pockets of speculators than enriching the lives of the local communities.‘Themes of social justice are most important to me, especially when I can show the parallels between past and present lives.’Marian was raised in Glasgow but has hopped all across the globe, living in Perthshire, France, Italy, Lanarkshire and, for the past 20 years, Argyll, contributing with tutoring in English and communications at Argyll College.Journalism took her around the world, covering the effects of conflict and natural disasters on communities, which is evident in her book covering the effect of an often dangerous industry on a community.In terms of looking to the future, Marian is keeping coy. ‘There’s all sorts of ideas going on and I’m hoping to move on with pretty soon.‘I’m doing creative writing courses for the college and that’s actually a great deal of fun because it takes me out of that zone. If you\u0026#8217re supporting people as their talents grow, that is superb and we have very talented writers of poetry and fiction in this area so it’s great to be able to nurture that.’PIC:10 books, probably 10 cakes later. 08_a29marianpallister02Not a Plack the Richer is the story of Argyll\u0026#8217s mining industry. 08_a29marianpallister05Marian Pallister was signing copies of her new book for fans. 08_a29marianpallister06\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrs oldest pub black bull","story":"NewsAyr’s oldest pub, the Black Bull, shuts AGAIN leaving furious staff in wage rowThe Black Bull on River Street was first opened in 1754 and has survived many turmoils in its time, including a blaze that broke out in 2014.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:33, 17 JUL 2018NewsShift manager Charlotte Forsyth, manager Jose Ruiz and barmaid Jade Taylor, with barmaid/ waitress Tori McDicken (front, left) and barmaid Dianne McConnachie (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr’s oldest pub has shut AGAIN leaving furious staff claiming they have been left out of pocket. The Black Bull on River Street was first opened in 1754 and has survived many turmoils in its time, including a blaze that broke out in 2014. But last Thursday, workers were told mid-shift to collect their belongings and leave, with the tenant having been given no warning of the foreclosure. Now, employees have joined a hospitality union to fight for what they are owed – and their boss has stated “they will get paid”. Day-shift manager, 23-year-old Charlotte Forsyth, was mid-shift when the pub’s owners, Rosemount Taverns, marched in and said they were shutting up shop. Charlotte told the Post: “I was in for about two hours and the head from Rosemount Taverns turned up and said: ‘I need the keys – I’m changing the locks, my joiner’s on his way.’  “I was crying and everything. “I’ve only be there for just over a month and I’ve not been paid a penny. “I still have bills to pay like everybody else. “I would not have left a stable job had I thought that in a month I’d be talking about signing on – it’s not on. Tenant Scott Burnell, of Glasgow, claimed he knew nothing about the decision to close and confirmed staff will receive outstanding wages. Mr Burnell said: “It wasn’t my decision at all – the pub company wanted to (close). “It came as a shock to me – I didn’t know anything about it until after it had actually happened.  “The wages haven’t come through yet – it’s a four-week cycle. “They were paid two weeks ago and they’ll be due to get paid in two weeks’ time – and they will be paid. “I’ll be 100 per cent honest – I’m going to have to find that money from somewhere else.” Furious workers took to social media to vent their anger after receiving information that claimed Mr Burnell had previously outed other workers of a job and money. Mr Burnell denied the claims and said: “I know what they’re saying on Facebook and that is not the case at all. “I don’t set out to rip anybody off – I had no idea that pub was closing yesterday. “Pubs do run into trouble – it happens – I’m not going to run away from this.”  Distraught barmaid and mum-of-two Dianne McConnachie said: “I’ve got children to feed and a roof to put over my head. “I live in a private let with a private landlord so I can be punted out any time. “Myself and colleague Jade are single parents – we’re the only people bringing money into our houses. “So what do we do? Do we go and sign on?” Boss Mr Burnell added: “The pub was closed down because it was losing so much money. “It was a disaster in terms of the administration and financial control of the pub from the management. “I think the level of incompetence and mismanagement was horrific.  “And then we discovered they’d been buying stuff on credit. There’s nothing wrong with that, that wasn’t their fault but I found another \u0026pound4000 in credit that hadn’t been paid for – it was absolutely out of control. “I was told on Friday morning the debt to the brewery was \u0026pound720 and by Tuesday afternoon, it had risen to \u0026pound4000. “It didn’t make any sense. “I’ve got a list of about \u0026pound500/ \u0026pound600 of advances paid out so they were not telling you that. “I know it looks bad for me and I’m prepared to accept that, but it’s not as black and white.”  Bryan Simpson, Unite Hospitality Organiser said: “This is not the first time that Scott Burnell has tried to cut and run with his workers’ hard-earned wages, but it will certainly be the last. “As the Director of Wire Inns, Idlewild and The Raven Hotel, he already owes thousands of pounds to former workers in unpaid wages. “Unite will continue to support our members at the Black Bull to get what they’re entitled to. “We have received assurances from the leaseholders of the pub – Rosemount Taverns – that as soon as they find new tenants for the pub they will endeavour to keep the staff in their jobs.” Rosemount Taverns were unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.

Keith McKissock washes up to 50 properties – many of them businesses – in Ayr town centre. But the dad-of-two faces a stand-off with parking wardens on his tail. Keith, who runs Craigie Cleaning Services, wants a special permit allowing his van into town. But despite offers to pay an annual fee, red tape and fines have dogged his progress. The 53-year-old said: “I’m just trying to go about my work – what I do actually improves the town. “If I wasn’t cleaning these windows, would the council? “I can’t carry 22 litres of water on my back with all my ladders. “Maybe they expect me to balance everything on my bike.”  Keith, once a top Scottish cyclist, was backed all the way by customers this week. Kenny McLachlan, of Ayr, said: “Keith’s been washing our windows for five years and you couldn’t meet a harder working guy. “The High Street needs all the support it can get – we shouldn’t be harassing people doing it a turn.”  Now Tory councillors are  hoping to ride to the cleaner’s rescue by proposing a new parking charter.  Group chief Martin Dowey said: “Examples exist in other councils where they charge an annual window cleaner permit. “Keith is someone who legitimately services our High Street and there needs to be a common sense solution.” Ayrshire’s roads boss Stewart Turner said: “Vehicles can’t remain in the same location for longer than 10 minutes without activity. “In addition, it is not possible to move a vehicle from one bay to another in attempt to buy time. “In Mr McKissock’s case, he can use the bays to undertake cleaning operations but can’t use them to park or collect money from customers. “He was recently asked to move his vehicle from a bay by a parking attendant as he was not carrying out any window cleaning activities. “The Alliance wrote to Mr McKissock, once again, regarding his behaviour towards our parking attendants. “Our employees deserve to be treated with respect and we have a responsibility to protect them.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12863891.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/8898834.jpg","title":"full time ayr united can","story":"NewsFull-time Ayr United can make their Mark in Ladbrokes ChampionshipThe Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:31, 6 JUL 2018NewsMark Roberts (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMark Roberts insists that being full-time could make all the difference for Ayr United this time round in the Championship. The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

Scarlett is a member of the Glasgow-based UK Theatre School which works with a string of casting directors to showcase its students’ talents. She was one of those selected to appear before the casting directors working on the new Legoland theme park TV and cinema advertisement. Having landed a part, she was cast as an excited youngster exploring the park in the advert. Scarlett, who is a pupil at Troon Primary, had to travel to London for a full day filming session. The theme of the new Legoland campaign focuses on their ‘Deep Sea Adventure’ and Scarlett is seen on board a submarine exploring the ocean and seeing Lego sea creatures swimming around. Scarlett said: “It was a really exciting experience to be involved with the production and I had such a great time. It’s amazing now to see the ad now that it’s finished.” Her proud mum Tracey said: “We were grateful to the UKTS scheme who worked with Scarlett. She absolutely loved the whole experience.” UKTS principal Lizanne Lambie Thomson said: “All our students have the chance to sign up to our own exclusive in-house castings agency. Our team works with casting directors and producers from the world of TV, radio, cinema and advertising and regularly approach us for casting candidates. “We’ve had students in big campaigns for big brands such as RBS, Legoland, Skoda and Aldi, to name but a few. The involvement gives our students an amazing insight into the behind the scenes production of ads as well as TV programmes, radio shows and movies. We’ve had our students appear alongside real Hollywood big stars such as Rihanna, Nicole Kidman, and Colin Firth as well as music artistes including Kylie Minogue, Rod Stewart and Michael Buble. This amazing Legoland project was a lot of fun to be involved with and even more fun for Scarlett as she’s now starring in it!

A line of four cars all belonging to the same man have hardly turned a wheel for more than a DECADE. The road beneath them is a weed and dirt splattered state, tarnishing the pleasant surroundings of the horseshoe-shaped Raithhill. Every year the forlorn fleet is removed with the help of the AA to ensure they get their MOT and are road legal. And when they are away, a reserve takes their place in case someone else grabs the spot. Last week the story emerged as the cars’ owner Derek Cumming - who runs a chartered accountancy business in Ayr - told police his cars had been vandalised. Police then issued a statement saying the damage had been of “significant financial impact on the owners of these vehicles.” Ayr CID said they are “speaking to the community and reviewing CCTV” and added damage happened between May 1 and June 26. But far from sympathy from residents who insisted the cars were a menace and claimed Mr Cumming couldn’t care less about the annoyance they caused. Neighbours claimed Mr Cumming does not stay in the villa, which was owned by his late mother, and that he lives in nearby Glenalla Crescent. Meanwhile, the cars remain at Raithhill. Usual residents are an 18-year-old silver AUDI TT convertible, two Mercedes SL500’s aged 10 and 11 and usually a Range Rover rather than the 16-year-old Toyota Avensis. On closer inspection there is no significant vandalism to the four cars currently there other than a few minor scrapes and scratches. The Audi and the red Mercedes have small scrapes to the pavement side which look like it has been “keyed.” The Mercedes also has a small panel missing next to the rear window. Residents queued-up to tell the Ayrshire Post of their displeasure. One lady said: “You won’t get any sympathy for him here. Nobody can understand what he is playing at and he doesn’t care he causes us upset.” Another lady added: “In the winter when there is ice it is actually dangerous as we don’t want to hit his cars. “There is grass growing through the tarmac as the council road sweeper cannot get to it. “The so-called vandalism looks nothing to me . . . in fact if that is all there has been in 10 years then he should count himself lucky. “It was his mother’s house and his aunt also used to live there.” And a gent added: “It obviously costs money to keep them road legal and the cars are usually taken away at night so they can get a new MOT. “The batteries are down so the AA has to re-start them. “Three of the cars have private plates and he is doing nothing wrong, but the mind boggles as to why. “Sadly there doesn’t seem to be anything we can do about it but it seems they are there to spite someone and is so infantile. “He once put flower pots down his driveway because he thought neighbours were parking there.” Sixty-three-year-old Mr Cumming runs an accountancy firm in Cathcart Street. This week he was unrepentant he was causing the neighbours stress. Asked why the cars had been there for up to 13 years, he replied: “Because that is my home.” When it was put to him that he actually lived in Glenalla Crescent, he said: “That’s my home. Nothing is bizarre. I do live in the house. “Don’t report anything outwith the police report. “I can park cars legally and that is the end of the matter. I have no further comment.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

million in 2016 to 1.09 million in 2017, while those with rats decreased by 2%.\nHowever there was an 8% rise in use of fish, from 287,000 in 2016 to 308,000 last year.\nThis was mainly due to the use of genetically modified zebrafish in basic research, according to the statistical release.\nCats, dogs, horses and non-human primates \u0026ndash described as \u0026ldquospecially protected species \u0026ndash were used in 1% of experimental procedures last year.\nThe number of experiments with dogs fell by 22% from 4,932 in 2016 to 3,847 in 2017, while those with cats rose slightly from 190 to 198.\nSince 2014, the Home Office, which is responsible for regulating animal experiments, has classified testing according to the amount of suffering it causes.\nOf around 1.89 million animal experiments performed last year, 50% were assessed as mild, 26% as moderate and 5% as severe.\nCruelty Free International said it was concerned that Britain\u0026rsquos departure from the European Union may lead to an increase in animal testing, with the UK potentially having to duplicate some tests.\nChief executive Michelle Thew said: \u0026ldquoBrexit has the potential to be a real opportunity to demonstrate to the world that the UK is committed to making difference for animals by reducing the extent of suffering in our laboratories and replacing animals with modern, humane testing methods.\n\u0026ldquoThe UK Government needs to step up and use this moment in history as a springboard to step up efforts to stop unnecessary animal

Your Safety. Your Choice.\u0026#8217The Royal Highland Education Trust (RHET) addressed the importance of getting children on farms to find out where their food comes from and that, with the right planning and precautions, they can be safe, fun and educational places.Carole Brunton, farmer and RHET Fife CI project coordinator, is in charge of organising farm visits throughout Fife, making sure that the farms, teachers and children are all ready for a fun, safe and educational experience.Her top tip for having children on farms is: \u0026#8216Common sense and plenty of planning.\u0026#8217Carole said: \u0026#8216For us, farm safety is extremely important. For the children’s safety, for the farmer’s reputation, and for RHET because if we had one accident on one farm it would stop all farm visits. We don’t want that to happen, so we have a strict regime.\u0026#8216We have a risk assessment process that we go through which we do with the farmer before the children are anywhere near the farm. Then we do a pre-visit with the teacher.\u0026#8216We go out with the teacher and the farmer and we do a pre-visit so that everyone knows what’s going to happen on the day when the children arrive.\u0026#8216On the day of the visit the farmer will make sure there’s no dangerous machinery sitting out or there’s not a hole being dug near to where we’ll be. We work closely with the host to make the site as safe as possible.\u0026#8216I would say common sense and supervision are the main things for any farm visit. We don’t want to make it all rules and regulations, so they can’t enjoy themselves. But there must be an element of control. We do tend to let them enjoy themselves and have a bit of fun because that’s the best way for them to learn.\u0026#8216We have a plan for every visit before we turn up, we have a plan of what we are going to do and where we’re going to take them.\u0026#8216Before leaving the farm they wash their hands with antibacterial soap, running water and paper towels, so there’s no contamination.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.

The band now hope to break through in the USA after independent radio show Passport Approved, which has been credited with helping the likes of Coldplay Muse, Adele and Dido find global success, added the single to its playlist.  The Passport Approved show is played on more than 70 radio stations over six continents, including in major US cities.  Jack said the band was excited about the future and was already planning to head Stateside.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe new single is going down a treat all over the globe!

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.

Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.

Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.  As well as his time with MacBrayne, the book looks at Kit\u0026rsquos dad\u0026rsquos time in the Armed Forces, as well as becoming a sub-postmaster in Aviemore as the town evolved from a \u0026ldquosleepy former railway junction into its present skiing and outdoor pursuits centre.  Kit, 66, who previously worked as a BBC correspondent, told the Courier he had \u0026ldquohalf an idea for another book but was still considering whether to put pen to paper once again.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day. The classical music enthusiast and trumpeter has also worked on a documentary about Felix Mendelssohn and is currently working on one on Fryderyk Chopin.  Now, following his graduation, he can\u0026rsquot wait to get his documentary career under way in earnest.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhilst studying I have been coached and trained by lecturers who are well-known in the industry and it has been wonderful to benefit from their experience.  \u0026ldquoI am now in the process of sitting down with production companies, and looking forward to establishing my own name as a documentary maker.

The other is a giant stainless steel mussel shell, depicting Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history, which was recently put in place at Murdoch Green.  Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

That performance did not come out of the blue \u0026ndash it was the culmination of many years of learning from others and pure hard work.  \u0026ldquoThe week after his victory in Blackpool, he returned to where he started at Inch Park, resplendent in his national champion\u0026rsquos jersey, to meet and inspire our younger riders.  \u0026ldquoHe became a hero figure for many of our Go-Ride members, and some of the coaches too.  The club added: \u0026ldquoThe response on social media to his loss reflects the regard in which he was held. He will be greatly missed by the cycling community in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWe pay tribute to his many achievements in his short life and extend our condolences to his parents, Keith and Margaret, sister Emma and girlfriend Hannah.  Scottish Cycling posted on Twitter: \u0026ldquoWe are saddened to hear of the sudden death of Ben Forsyth, a former British youth champion and who at only 20 years of age had so much to live for.  \u0026ldquoOur thoughts are with his family and friends.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.

However the number is up 4% from a decade ago, the data from the Home Office reveals.  Horses were involved in 10,600 experiments in 2017, an increase of almost a fifth (18%) from the previous year when there were 8,948.  The Home Office said this was \u0026ldquoprincipally for the provision of blood products for diagnostic products.  Animal rights groups said the overall decrease was \u0026ldquotoo little, too late and called for greater investment in scientific methods which do not involve testing on living creatures.  Hazel Jackson, science director of Animal Free Research UK, said: \u0026ldquoThis almost negligible decrease in the number of animal experiments is simply too little, too late.  \u0026ldquoInstead of continuing to pump money into outdated, cruel and often misleading animal research, more needs to be done to invest in the UK\u0026rsquos expert researchers who are developing innovative, human-relevant methods which are best placed to discover treatments for debilitating human diseases.  Around half of the total procedures were experiments using animals to develop treatments, test the safety of pharmaceuticals and chemicals, for surgical training and education, and for species protection.  The remainder involved the creation and breeding of genetically modified animals, producing offspring for use in further experiments.  Mice, rats and fish accounted for 87% of experimental procedures.  The number involving mice fell by 10% from 1.22 million in 2016 to 1.09 million in 2017, while those with rats decreased by 2%.  However there was an 8% rise in use of fish, from 287,000 in 2016 to 308,000 last year.  This was mainly due to the use of genetically modified zebrafish in basic research, according to the statistical release.  Cats, dogs, horses and non-human primates \u0026ndash described as \u0026ldquospecially protected species \u0026ndash were used in 1% of experimental procedures last year.  The number of experiments with dogs fell by 22% from 4,932 in 2016 to 3,847 in 2017, while those with cats rose slightly from 190 to 198.  Since 2014, the Home Office, which is responsible for regulating animal experiments, has classified testing according to the amount of suffering it causes.  Of around 1.89 million animal experiments performed last year, 50% were assessed as mild, 26% as moderate and 5% as severe.  Cruelty Free International said it was concerned that Britain\u0026rsquos departure from the European Union may lead to an increase in animal testing, with the UK potentially having to duplicate some tests.  Chief executive Michelle Thew said: \u0026ldquoBrexit has the potential to be a real opportunity to demonstrate to the world that the UK is committed to making difference for animals by reducing the extent of suffering in our laboratories and replacing animals with modern, humane testing methods.  \u0026ldquoThe UK Government needs to step up and use this moment in history as a springboard to step up efforts to stop unnecessary animal experiments."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7770451.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"humza-yousafs-thumbs-up-to-hilarious-memes-poking-fun-at-his-official-government-pictures","story":"  The internet has delighted in poking fun at the new Justice Secretary\u0026rsquos official \u0026ldquoserious and \u0026ldquosmiling Scottish Government by satirising them to illustrate good and bad news.

At Islay Ales they produce a range of both cask and bottles conditioned beers. The bottled beers are real ale in a bottle. The beer is neither filtered nor pasteurised prior to being bottled and therefore continues to ferment and mature in the bottle. This process produces sediment in the bottom of the bottle.    They have recently started to make use of the fact that many individuals have bottled their own whisky on Islay and are looking for something special to do with the empty cask. They fill these casks with part of a brew and then allow the influences of the whisky and the wood to act on the beer by maturing it for at least six weeks up to almost three months, depending on the requirements of the customer.  This year Islay Ales were delighted to have been asked by WW100 Islay to produce an ale to commemorate the ending of the First World War and to remember those lives lost in the tragic sinking of two troops ships off Islay  Visitors are more than welcome to visit the Brewery, they are happy to show how the beers are brewed in the 4-barrel plant, which produces 1150 pints (640 litres) at a time. Depending on what day you come to the brewery you could see the brewing in action or it might be the casking, bottling or labelling, all of which takes place on site.  Before or after a tour of the brewery you can sample some of the available ales, sometimes Islay Ales might even have some on draught for you to try. You can also purchase bottles of the beers as well as Thistly Cross Cider. If you are looking for presents or something to remember them by, the Brewery shop has a range of clothing, glasses and other items.    The Brewery and shop is open from 10.30 to 5.00 Monday to Saturday during the summer but only to 4.00 in the winter. They generally do not open on Sundays unless a special request has been made.  A large number of establishments on Islay take the ales, either in bottle form or on draught so when you come to visit the island you are sure to be able to find Islay Ales near to where you are staying.  www.islayales  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Brander Lodge  Nestled within a scenic and tranquil location, The Brander Lodge offers comfortable and stylish facilities for those looking to relax and explore.

Across the UK, 50% preferred to remain. Those between 18 and 24 were more adamant remainers with three in four wanting to stay in the EU.  In the three way exit deal referendum idea forwarded by former Cabinet minister Justine Greening that would eliminate the least popular option of leaving with a deal in the first round.  After the second preferences of \u0027leave with deal\u0027 voters were allocated, the final result in Scotland handed remain a 66% share and leave with 34%.    The referendum idea was itself unpopular with UK voters, with only 36% in favour of the proposal and 47% against the idea.  The former education secretary argued the final Brexit decision should be given back to the people and out of the hands of \"deadlocked politicians\".  She called for three options to be on the ballot paper: the prime minister\u0027s Chequers deal, staying in the EU or a clean break from Europe with no deal.  The UK is due to leave in March 2019.  Downing Street rejected Justine Greening\u0027s call for a fresh referendum on the UK\u0027s exit from the EU, saying it will not happen \"in any circumstances\".  The poll also found that 60% of Scots thought in hindsight that it was wrong to leave the EU, compared to 46 per cent across the UK.  But 47% of those Scots polled did not think that once the Brexit negotiations were complete and the terms of Britain\u0027s exit have been agreed, that there should be another referendum to accept or reject them."},{"url":null,"title":"university-sacks-priest-who-held-service-for-the-gross-offence-of-pride-glasgow","story":"  Father Mark Morris, of Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church, in Glasgow, invited parishioners on Monday night to a rosary of reparation.

Principal Prof Pamela Gillies CBE FRSE said: \"Following due consultation, Father Mark Morris will not return to his chaplaincy role at the University in September.  \"The University will work with the Archdiocese of Glasgow to ensure the continued provision of chaplaincy support for staff and students at our Faith and Belief Centre when the new term starts.  \"The University is strongly inclusive and committed to supporting equality and diversity on campus.\"  Jordan Daly, Co-Founder of Time for Inclusive Education (TIE), which campaigns for inclusive education in schools, said it was \"sad and disappointing\" to see Father Morris\u0027s \"condemnation\" of the event.  He said: \"The Pride parade was, as always, a vibrant and colourful display of diversity, acceptance, and inclusivity.  \"The ethos of the parade is equality and love, so it is sad and disappointing to see that Father Morris has countered those fundamental values by holding this service and allowing a narrative of exclusion and condemnation to enter the mainstream as a result.\"  Father Morris celebrates Mass on Thursdays in the Faith and Belief Centre in the university\u0027s William Harley Building, and hears confession.  A spokesman for the Catholic Church in Glasgow said: \"This was a private parish devotion unrelated to Father Morris\u0027s role as chaplain.\"  NUS Scotland\u0027s LGBT+ Officer Kai O\u0027Doherty added: \"NUS Scotland is proud to be at the forefront of breaking down barriers facing LGBT+ people.  \"Universities should be a place where every student, regardless of religion, sexuality, or identity, feels accepted and supported to study without fear of discrimination.  \"Everybody within our university communities has a duty to ensure that campuses are compatible with the accepting and progressive culture that they strive to achieve.  \"We\u0027re proud of the progress that has been made, but every day we are reminded of how far we still have to go to achieve a truly inclusive society.\"  Following Ms Sturgeon\u0027s involvement in Pride, a Scottish Government spokesman said: \"Scotland is considered to be one of the most progressive countries in Europe regarding LGBTI equality, and Pride Glasgow is a fantastic event that brings communities together and celebrates all that LGBTI people contribute to Scottish life.  \"As a society we must champion equality and fairness at all times and defend the progress that has been made.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scots-tesla-investor-demands-action-from-elon-musk-for-calling-thailand-diver-pedo","story":"  Mr Musk\u0026rsquos posts on Twitter sparked backlash from shareholders and Silicon Valley analysts\u0026nbspwho called his behaviour immature and an impediment to the car company\u0026rsquos success.

Twenty years later BBC viewers were treated to a similar show as police swooped on the home of Sir Cliff Richard as part of an investigation into historic child abuse, except the singer had not been arrested or charged with anything.  Now that Sir Cliff has won his case for a \u0026ldquoserious invasion of privacy against the BBC, the corporation is claiming that the ruling marks a significant shift against Press freedom and the public right to know.  They may well be right, but in the BBC\u0026rsquos haste to restore its reputation following the Jimmy Savile disgrace, they and South Yorkshire Police have been the architects of this situation.

Any media identification of people or companies alleged to have been involved with wrong-doing could now claim their privacy is being breached and it could kill investigative journalism stone dead.  The bar of a privacy breach is far lower than that of defamation, as proved in the Naomi Campbell case when she successfully sued the Mirror for breach of privacy in revealing her treatment for drug addiction despite making anti drug statements. Or Max Mosley, the motor racing chief who won his case against the News of the World, despite the story of his involvement in an orgy with five prostitutes being true bar one fact.

The Apple Parrot drones are used by the older children to programme flight paths, manoeuvres and even aerobatic tricks for the drones to perform in order to complete set challenges - or just to impress.Andy Gould, IT Solutions Architect for Expro, said: “In an increasingly digital age, the knowledge and skills of coding are becoming more important for our next generation of school children.“We have seen the demand for apps and technology in the workplace increase exponentially, therefore future generations who can build/develop these will have a significant career advantage.“The equipment we’ve donated to the new coding club harnesses the enthusiasm shown by the pupils, allowing them to build their skills and confidence in this area. It’s been inspiring to see them embrace this technology so quickly, often outperforming the adults in the room.”                                                                                                        Cara Hay, Depute Head Teacher at Strathburn Primary School, added: “We are extremely grateful to Expro for its generous donation towards the development of our Coding Club.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Thursday 19 Jul 2018 12:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116574.jpg","title":"High calibre medical staff recruited in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbspNHS Highland yesterday confirmed the full and part-time appointments, which include two advanced nurse practitioners and a physiotherapist.Bill Fernie, chairman of Caithness Health Action Team, said: \u0026ldquoIt is definitely good news that the posts which were empty for a long time are being filled and that is welcomed by us.\u0026ldquoThis is a success for NHS Highland but it has been a long time coming.

The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care.

This is an entirely natural phenomenon, the statement underlined.The death of cocker spaniel Bell prompted an investigation by Highland Council which then started to put up warning signs about the killer algae cyanobacteria.Earlier this week, two tourists from Ayrshire \u0026ndash who did not wish to be named \u0026ndash described the green slime as \u0026ldquoan eyesore and said they were concerned about their dog cooling off \u0026ldquoin that mess.One of them said: \u0026ldquoWe were here last year and it was nothing like this.

Pupils at Wick High could also miss out on extracurricular activities, it was stated.At present, Stagecoach runs a service to Gills Bay three times a day, Monday to Saturday, but from next month it will operate twice a day, Monday to Friday. There are additional journeys between Wick and John O\u0026rsquoGroats but they vary according to school hours.A Stagecoach spokeswoman said the company recognised the feedback from the community over its plans. \u0026ldquoThe revised proposals represent a significant investment by Stagecoach, and work will continue to promote these links to encourage a sustainable level of demand. A review will take place 12 months after the start of the new timetable in order to establish the long term future of the bus service to Gills Bay.Trudy Morris, who chairs the Caithness Transport Forum, said: \u0026ldquoWe are very pleased to see that Stagecoach has listened to the local community and agreed to secure the bus link to Gills Bay for a further 12 months. Not only will this bring benefit to local bus users, who would otherwise be isolated in their communities, but it also has potential to benefit the tourist market, providing services to link with the Gills Bay ferry.However, she is concerned about the review in 12 months time and said: \u0026ldquoWe will be working with Stagecoach and the local community to see what can be done to promote usage of the route, and will also be discussing with public sector partners such as Highland Council to see what might be done to secure the route on a non-commercial basis in future.Bill Mowat, the chairman of Gills Harbour Ltd, claimed public pressure had an impact on Stagecoach and pointed out there was strong opposition to the plan.Thursday 19 Jul 2018 12:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 19, 2018 at 11:39 amThe multi-agency Orkney Local Emergency Co-ordinating Group (OLECG) met today,  in response to the grounding of the freight vessel MV Priscilla on a skerry in the Pentland Firth.

We created the FitHomes concept to help Highland residents take charge of their own wellbeing and health needs through innovative technology and design.\"Thanks to the support we\u0026rsquove had from Centrica, both financially and advisory, we will be able to deliver digital health and assisted living technologies in a way that has not been possible before.\"The investment has been made by Centrica\u0026rsquos Ignite social impact investment fund. Established in 2017, Centrica Innovations aims to invest \u0026pound100 million by 2022 in new technologies that will transform the way people live, work and move.Sam Salisbury, Centrica Innovations labs director, said: \"As a market leader in connected home products, we are always on the lookout for opportunities to solve real world problems with new technology and innovation. The lack of affordable, energy efficient, desirable homes is one that is affecting families across the country so we\u0026rsquore delighted to be able to support an initiative that shows such potential in transforming how people, young and old, live in their homes.\"The origins of the FitHome go back to 2008 when a tenant was found dead in his home, having lain unnoticed for over a year. Vowing to put new preventative systems in place, Albyn commissioned research exploring potential solutions. As a result, the society decided to develop its own system that could be adopted across its growing portfolio of homes.Matt Stevenson of Carbon Dynamic said of FitHomes: \"I truly believe that this housing method can change the way that we view construction of new housing developments as well as feeding into the wider healthcare and societal issues.\"Thursday 19 Jul 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Thursday 19 Jul 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Visitors will then be able to access behind the scenes areas of the museum, experiencing objects up close.Curator Dr Karen Buchanan explained: \"We want to make as much of the material in our collections accessible as possible. This includes not only our objects in storage, but also the wealth of archive and library material we hold, which document the history of Gairloch parish. This funding will maximise our storage space, protect our collection for the future and enrich our visitors\u0026rsquo experiences.\"Museums Galleries Scotland is the National Development Body for museums and galleries in Scotland and offers strategic development support to the sector.

A spokesperson for the judges said:\"He is someone who thoroughly deserves to be recognised for the great contribution he has made to both the industry and the community. A wonderful role model and ambassador.\"Stories shared by his colleagues when nominating him, included times when he dug out roads during a storm to deliver bottled gas and a generator to a terminally-ill customer delivering flowers to a customer who had recently lost her husband, and caring for a customer who had suffered a severe stroke.\"For me, it isn\u0026rsquot about going above and beyond, it\u0026rsquos about doing what I feel is the right thing to do and making sure our customers are cared for and supported when they need us most,\" said a modest Mr Sutherland, who said the award was as much recognition for the Highland team as for himself. \"I\u0026rsquom delighted to take this award home to my wife and girls, who have supported me along the way as I disappeared for days during storms, sometimes missing important events and occasions at home. It\u0026rsquos all worth it as I\u0026rsquom glad to say I still love my job as much as I did when I joined 44 years ago as an apprentice.\"Colin Pirie, SSEN\u0026rsquos head of Region for the Highlands and Islands, added: \"Mike is without doubt the most dedicated, conscientious person I have ever met in my 28 years with SSEN.\"He genuinely cares for everyone he meets. His selfless attitude and his devotion to customers, colleagues (especially young people and trainees) and his family is well known. He is an example to us all.\"Mike is a great colleague but more importantly a great friend to all of us in the Highlands.\"Since their launch of the Utility Week Stars Awards in 2014, the annual event has grown to become the de facto celebration of dedication, ingenuity and teamwork in the UK utilities sector.SSEN picked up another gong, as the SSEN Safety, Health and Environment team won the Health and Safety Initiative award for the roll-out of an influencing behaviours training programme and safety licence across the division.Thursday 19 Jul 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Depute fiscal Alison McKenzie told Sheriff Margaret Neilson the 15-year-old was being trained in lifeguard skills and it was when they were alone at the pool Russell repeatedly fondled him over his trunks: \"It happened so frequently he could not recall the number of occasions he was molested,\" said the fiscal.The boy didn\u0026rsquot report the assaults and told no-one until many years later as a father of two he received a letter from Russell offering to act as a football scout for his children.The fiscal said: \"The complainer was furious, recalled the abuse he suffered at the hands of the accused, and made a statement of complaint to police.\"Russell admitted assaulting the boy on various dates between 1977 and 1979 at Dingwall Sports Centre Swimming Pool and between May and June 1981 at the Mackay Hostel sexually assaulting a 16-year-old.He further admitted assaulting an 18-year-old by handling his buttocks over his kilt in 1983 at a street in Dingwall and exposing himself to him.He also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting an 18- year-old at the hostel in 1984 by sitting on his bed uninvited, placing his hand under the bed covers and repeatedly attempting to touch his genitals.Sentence was deferred after his last appearance for reports.Russell is due to appear in court again on August 2.Thursday 19 Jul 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In more recent times, it has seen the fairytale rise of Ross County from Highland League to Premiership \u0026ndash and a notorious Town Hall appearance by the Beatles when the Fab Four were on the brink of global success.Now, history hunters are being targeted by DCDC which has sought to work with the public to create a new vision of the town.Fascinating facts are being assembled by Dingwall History Society for panels dotting the town and shining light on its rich past.Secretary\u0026nbspSandra MacDonald said: \"Dingwall has a very long and significant history and we have the information available.\"The group will gather facts and suggest significant sites worthy of interpretation but will not have the final say.Mrs MacDonald, whose late husband David \"DD\" MacDonald chaired the society for a decade, said: \"There are the obvious sites like the Tollbooth \u0026ndash the tower and the clock.\"Other sites being considered include the war memorials at Station Square and the Hector Macdonald Monument and Moot Hill in the Cromartie Memorial car park, where the Vikings are believed to have held gatherings.Mrs MacDonald added: \"A board can carry a minimum amount of information but can indicate where people can access far more online.\"DCDC secretary Robin Lingard revealed the heritage trail is one of several items being proposed by the group, set up as a charity two years ago to tap funding pots for improvements. He told a recent open meeting that membership had more than doubled. \"We are very pleased,\" he said. \"I think out of it new ideas will come forward.\"Community activist George Murray, project manager for Dingwall Means Business, targeting the establishment of a business improvement district (BID), said: \"I think the DCDC is the perfect body to spearhead and develop plans like the heritage trail. I see it as being beneficial not only for local community development and participation but also as a way of presenting our community heritage to the world, especially as we get busier with the advent of the cruise tour coaches beginning to discover the town and the success of the NC500 route.\"If suitable funding can be put in place a heritage trail round the area could be a real boon to the town.\"Dingwall councillor Angela MacLean said a trail is \"a fantastic opportunity\" to showcase the town.She said: \"Many of the DCDC group\u0026rsquos wish list buildings are in the ownership of the Highland Council and if DCDC or another local group would like to take over and run of any of these buildings I am more than happy to lend my support. I would also like to congratulate DCDC for the work they have done so far and look forward to working with them to make some of their proposals a reality over the coming years.\"\u0026bull What do you think about the idea?

The Oil \u0026amp Gas Technology Centre (OGTC) is leading the industry-backed “Facility of the Future” initiative that could halve the cost of developing and operating an oil and gas facility and help to access the equivalent of more than 3.5 billion barrels of reserves in so-called marginal discoveries.            A discovery is classed as marginal when the risks or technology involved make it too challenging to develop economically, for instance because of its geographical location or the specialist equipment needed.            The project wants to design a new approach that will make this process more efficient than traditional methods, such as fixed platforms.It aims to develop lower-cost, reusable facilities that can be remotely operated from onshore control centres, thereby increasing reducing the requirement for staff to work in the hazardous offshore environment and creating skilled onshore jobs. Chris Pearson, the OGTC’s small pools solution centre manager, said: “Oil and gas is playing catch-up with many industries when it comes to automation and remote operations. We’re exploring how the combination of existing and new technology can be best used in the offshore environment to improve safety, reduce life cycle cost and increase efficiency.“New, smarter and more automated ways of developing oil and gas fields are required if we’re to fully unlock marginal discoveries and maximise economic recovery from the UKCS. “The Facility of the Future initiative will help to significantly reduce life-cycle costs and strengthen the investment case for both marginal discoveries and more traditional reservoirs.”            The initiative will kick off with a study led by Crondall Energy and Buoyant Production Technologies to develop a floating facility adapted from the type of installations currently used for shallow water gas fields, known as NUIs, to make them suitable for oil discoveries. It hopes to design an NUI concept that will function at any water depth and uses a minimal manning approach by involving remote control and automation technologies.Niki Chambers, project manager at the marginal development solutions centre, said: “This study is looking at unlocking the capabilities of these floating facilities to work across any kind of discovery. It is opening up the whole of the UKCS.” The OGTC is supported by the Scottish and UK governments, Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire councils and Opportunity North East. It also generates funding from industry and university partners, and is currently in the process of securing further funds for subsequent studies as part of this initiative."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770822.1531988489!/image/image.jpg","title":"business stream looking to make waves with sales and marketing director","story":"        Water supplier Business Stream has hired a sales and marketing director from a rival business.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770715.1531940380!/image/image.jpg","title":"kevan christie judge politicians and officials by ability not bmi","story":"        The public shaming of NHS Scotland\u0026#8217s chief executive and our new Health Secretary \u0026#8211 who were told to quit their bad habits and \u0026#8220practice what they preach\u0026#8221 \u0026#8211 overstepped the mark in terms of intruding into people\u0026#8217s private lives.                No doubt, Tam Fry, chair of the National Obesity Forum, and Glasgow University nutritional expert Professor Mike Lean have enjoyed the 15 minutes of fame that their rudeness brought them.             These paragons of virtue effectively ‘called-out’ Health Secretary Jeane Freeman for allegedly smoking, having previously made an attempt to quit, while NHS Scotland’s chief executive Paul Gray was outed as a ‘fatty’ and told to lose weight.             It’s not my concern if Freeman smokes like a laboratory beagle – as long as she does something about NHS waiting times and delayed discharge. The same goes for Gray. He could go home at night and attach himself to a Toblerone drip for all I care. The important question here is – can he do the job? The calls from music hall double act Fry and Lean mark a worrying trend and do little to quell the sort of body fascism that leads to teenagers developing eating problems. READ MORE: Kevan Christie: Jeane Freeman makes good start as Health SecretaryI wouldn’t hesitate to criticise the Health Secretary on these pages or the chief executive of the NHS for that matter, but would never dream of making it personal by commenting on their habits or appearance. Their personal choices are their own to make.It fair to say both have risen to their posts through a combination of hard work and perseverance. The individuals in question are in key posts that bring a high degree of stress and it could be argued Freeman has the most difficult job in the Scottish Government.             Both are adults and, yes, both will know that smoking and obesity are killers. When they have time during the stressful lives they lead, they are probably trying to change bad habits – who isn’t? But to be subjected to this kind of personal attack, which came out of left field, is preposterous and stuck out like a sore thumb in the current climate of political correctness. Last December, a UK study estimated that one in four nurses are obese, and making a link between the long hours they work and their diet is easy to do. These dedicated health professionals probably eat on the go and are often too stressed and tired to rustle up a low-carb stir fry with extra quinoa.

I don’t agree. Granted it would be nice, but we’re in dangerous waters if people start getting employed based on their body mass index as opposed to their ability.In fact, someone like Gray is the ideal person to talk about obesity as he has ownership of the problem and first-hand experience of the difficulties some people face in trying to lose weight.We’re encroaching into similar territory as someone saying for instance, you can’t manage a Premiership football team unless you’ve played at the highest level – but Jose Mourinho has rubbished that kind of thinking. And does anyone seriously believe Freeman is a role model for people to emulate? She’s not Beyoncé.            So, while I agree with Fry and Lean’s central message on health. I feel on this occasion there was no need to shoot the messengers."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4758343.1531948209!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment health service without doctors is not worthy of the name","story":"        An array of different pressures have combined to create a crisis for the NHS in Scotland.                An array of different pressures have combined to create a crisis for the NHS in Scotland.            And one of the most significant is a growing shortage of doctors. According to the Royal College of General Practitioners Scotland, there will be 856 unfilled vacancies for GPs by 2021. And that means potentially life-threatening delays for patients trying to get an appointment and increased pressure on the GPs currently in the job.             Scotland is not alone with many countries around the world struggling to attract doctors, but that is no excuse. If anything, it demonstrates the need to find a lasting solution to the recruitment problem because competition for doctors will only get more intense.It is blindingly obvious that the best way to increase the number of doctors is to train more Scots to become doctors. However, new figures released by the Scottish Government show that the number of Scottish-domiciled students taking clinical medicine degrees at our universities fell to a ten-year low of 2,160 last year, compared to 2,350 in 2013/14.One reason for that is Scottish students face competition for places at medical schools from people from all over the world. Because medicine is a much more expensive course than other subjects to teach, the number of Scots allowed to enrol is controlled by the Scottish Government and international students are a lucrative source of external funds, effectively helping to subsidise the education of Scots.But this could prove to be a false economy. If the number of newly trained doctors fails to keep up with demand, then the recruitment crisis will only get worse. So the Scottish Government needs to take steps to persuade more school pupils that a career in medicine is for them – and they could start by addressing the causes of “GP burnout”, a problem described vividly by one doctor in The Scotsman recently.            But they also need to consider ways to persuade medical students from England, Wales and further afield that they should stay in Scotland after they graduate. During their student years, some may decide they like living in Scotland, but there are surely things that could be done to encourage the idea. Whatever strategy is adopted, Scotland needs to act quickly. It hardly needs saying but a health service without doctors is not worthy of the name."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770921.1531997913!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp msp james dornan admits false independence claim on rt","story":"        An SNP MSP has admitted he made a \u0026#8220mistake\u0026#8221 after falsely claiming that a majority of Scots supported independence during an interview on the Kremlin-backed channel RT.

[James Dornan] has been at it as well,” she wrote on Twitter.Mr Dornan then hit back, claiming that the Tories were trying to deflect attention away from their “dark money, Brexit fiasco, manipulating of democracy scandals”.He was referring to claims that a trust with links to the Scottish Tories may have been used to obscure the source of funds given to the party, which has been dubbed “Dark Money”.“I made an error and then put my hands up, you should try it sometime, feels good,” he told Ms Davidson. “Talking of useful idiots, has Theresa [May] given you permission to talk about Dark Money yet?”            The SNP has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4761169.1531981182!/image/image.jpg","title":"more disruption from faults sees scotrail record worst june punctuality since 2006","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The impact of increasing passenger disruption from rail network faults is alarming industry chiefs as figures showed ScotRail punctuality has got worse for nearly a year.                The train operator also suffered its worst June punctuality since 2006.            Major incidents included two overhead power line problems at Glasgow Central and Airdrie, which each delayed around one in ten of ScotRail’s 2,500 daily trains. The faults contributed to ScotRail’s annual punctuality falling or remaining static for the tenth consecutive month.            It dipped to 89.1 per cent of trains arriving at their destination within five minutes of schedule in the year to 23 June - the official measure.That was 0.2 points lower than in May and compares to 91.2 per cent last August.However, the latest monthly performance was worse, with 88.7 per cent punctuality between 27 May and 23 June.That compares to 92 per cent in the same period last year and 90 per cent in June 2016.The Scotsman has been told senior ScotRail officials are concerned at the level of disruption from faults which are the responsibility of their alliance partners Network Rail.            Last month, 72 per cent of ScotRail delays were caused by Network Rail, compared to 58 per cent over the last year.The next figures could be worse because record temperatures in the last week of June caused massive rail disruption across the Central Belt.Rail temperatures reached 51C, triggering widespread speed restrictions to prevent buckling and derailments.Angry passengers have tweeted their frustration. Samantha, a finance industry manager, wrote: “Not had a day yet since I started commuting with @ScotRail where they haven’t ruined my commute. Signalling issue after signalling issue.”            Matthew Verran from Dunfermline tweeted: “@ScotRail @networkrail seriously get your **** together with the signalling problems in Edinburgh, it’s DAILY.”Kirsty tweeted: “Different day, same ‘signalling error’ with scotrail - had more issues this summer with delays than in winter. @ScotRail get your act together honestly!”The deteriorating performance comes despite the introduction of two improvement plans, with the latest, by ex-industry chief Nick Donovan, leading to trains no longer missing station stops to reduce knock-on disruption.Scottish Conservatives transport spokesman Jamie Greene said new transport secretary Michael Matheson “must get to grips with the chaos engulfing Scotland’s railways”, which cost taxpayers nearly £800 million a year to run.He said: “Passengers across Scotland are growing tired of constant delays, disruptions or cancellations to their service. “Our railways are a lifeline service for many people who need to travel for work, school or to access vital public services. The very least they expect is that their train arrives at the station on time.            A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government’s Transport Scotland agency said: “We expect ScotRail to make positive steps by building on the recommendations  in the independent Donovan review.\u2028“This is already being achieved with skip stopping being all but eradicated and further review actions will bring gradual performance improvement over the coming months.”A ScotRail Alliance spokesman “June’s high temperatures caused some significant challenges and our infrastructure engineers are reviewing how we can make our railway even more reliable for our passengers.“We know we still need to improve, and there is more to do to deliver the service our customers deserve.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct.

One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney. It is reasonable to suspect that the SNP is in the unions’ pockets.\nI can only suggest that if Christopher wants to find out who is in the ‘unions pockets’ he should investigate the connection between the Labour Party and Unite,  and while he’s at it perhaps he should refresh his memory as to what powers are reserved at Westminster and which are devolved to Holyrood.\nThere are so many reds under beds these days \u0026#8230\n My primary concern is that Shetland and Orkney folk will be at risk for a number of August days while this irresponsible union strikes.

Assisting parents and carers with the costs of school clothing can help to alleviate poverty in the Highlands. \"\nLeader of the Council Councillor Margaret Davidson commented: \"The average cost of clothing primary and secondary school pupils in Highland is now estimated to range from around \u0026pound106 to \u0026pound130 per pupil which is a significant outlay for parents. I very much welcome this increase in school clothing grant as it helps to reduce inequalities for Highland families and is one of the measures being taken to proactively address poverty, and in particular child poverty.\"\nApplications are now being invited for the academic year starting in August 2018. To streamline the application process, the council has a single application form for school clothing grants and free school meals.

in the eye of storm in Tornado Alley","story":"Nicole Webber\n\u0026nbsp\nA storm chaser from Newtonmore had to run for cover from some of the world\u0027s most extreme weather in Tornado Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nThursday 19 Jul 2018 12:39

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve.

I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27408  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nFormer Louth TD and republican ex-prisoner Paddy Agnew was in Leinster House for the first time today, 37 years after being elected. \nPaddy Agnew was one of three republican prisoners elected during the 1981 hunger strikes while imprisoned in Long Kesh and taking part in the blanker protest. \nHe was elected in the 1981 general election, topping the poll in the Louth constituency.

It has created uncertainty and trepidation in sections of our community and for others an anticipation of constitutional change. \n\"So even without a specific timeframe, it is becoming apparent to a growing cross-section of opinion that partition is running out of road.\" \n\nThe Derry man also said all sections of society should be preparing for such constitutional change. \n\"A refusal to discuss or engage in preparations for such seismic change would be a wilful dereliction of duty and risks a return to the bad old days. \n\"The outworking of these dynamics, however, need not be a threat. in reality the reinforce the imperative for political engagement and dialogue.

A sculpture, perhaps modelled on the Washington Memorial Wall, on which could be inscribed the names of every person killed as a result of the 30 years war that ended in 1998.
