People living in the south of the country are more extroverted, with as many as 30 close friends on average, compared to 23 for Northerners. Pictured: The Angel of the North, GatesheadMen tend to have a wider circle, with 27 mates each compared to 22 for women.And despite the fact we meet our friends three times a week on average, only half of Britons (52 per cent) are happy with the number of chums they have.Almost six out of 10 (57 per cent) communicate with their friends face to face, 53 per cent said they use messaging apps and 44 per cent talk on the phone.Despite only 12 per cent of those surveyed saying they enjoy using social media, it is the primary form of communication for more than half (54 per cent) of respondents. Almost eight out of 10 (79 per cent) think friendship is much easier in modern times because of the many ways to stay in touch.Only 46 per cent of people would prefer to talk to their friends face to face, a figure that goes up to 60 per cent in those aged 60 or over.The study of almost 2,000 Brits across the UK, also found that more than half (59 per cent) have online friends they have never met in real life before.Still, more than three quarters of Brits (77 per cent) think life would be harder if they had no pals, a proportion that goes up to 85 per cent for those between 16 and 29.In fact, 85 per cent believe friendship is more important now, what with the pressures of modern life and 84 per cent added that the best moments of their lives were with their mates.Kim Mills, Sponsorship \u0026amp Partnerships Manager at Foxy Bingo said: \u0027At Foxy Bingo, we\u0027re all about our vibrant and friendly online community.\u0027We wanted to take a closer look at modern British friendships, and it\u0027s so interesting to see the regional spread in terms of friendship group sizes, and how people value their friends. \u0027It\u0027s no surprise to see that so many of our friendships are played out online these days, our online chat is more popular than ever and we like to think our online community feel at home with Foxy Bingo.\u0027The research also found that a third (39 per cent) of people have friends they barely see in person, but they would still consider a close companion, while more than a quarter (26 per cent) said life without pals would be unbearable.Nearly a third believed they could count on their friends for absolutely anything, 24 per cent added that their pals mean everything to them and more than a fifth (22 per cent) think their friends know them better than anyone in their lives.One in ten (nine per cent) believe friends to be more important than family, and seven per cent would rather be with their best friend than their partner.On the other hand, a quarter said they had been betrayed by a friend and 11 per cent said there was no one they truly trust, and 16 per cent worried that their mates didn\u0027t really like them.And seven per cent added that they have a frenemy, someone who they secretly dislike, and eight per cent confused they are competitive with the people they call friends.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Brazils Carnival erupts explosion colour","story":"    Rocking the feathers: A member of the Portela samba school performs during the second of two parades at 2019 Brazilian Carnival at Sapucai Sambadrome in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil          Time to party! A reveller from Paraiso do Tuiuti samba school performs in a scantily bodysuit, accessorised with flashing lights and buoyant feathers, during the second night of parades          They\u0027ve got the moves!

The project will create up to 20 new jobs with the profits being reinvested into charitable activities at the Dumfries House estate.The 18th century property, designed by the Adam brothers, was put up for sale by its former owner, the aristocrat and former F1 racing driver Johnny Dumfries.It opened to the public in the summer of 2008 following intensive restoration work.Princes Charles recently merged four of his charities focusing on culture, heritage, built environment and community education into one foundation based at Dumfries House.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Brentford fan given hilarious birthday surprise friends pay team mascot","story":"    As the players walk out onto the pitch they hold hands with the mascots, all under the age of 10.

People living in the south of the country are more extroverted, with as many as 30 close friends on average, compared to 23 for Northerners. Pictured: The Angel of the North, GatesheadMen tend to have a wider circle, with 27 mates each compared to 22 for women.And despite the fact we meet our friends three times a week on average, only half of Britons (52 per cent) are happy with the number of chums they have.Almost six out of 10 (57 per cent) communicate with their friends face to face, 53 per cent said they use messaging apps and 44 per cent talk on the phone.Despite only 12 per cent of those surveyed saying they enjoy using social media, it is the primary form of communication for more than half (54 per cent) of respondents. Almost eight out of 10 (79 per cent) think friendship is much easier in modern times because of the many ways to stay in touch.Only 46 per cent of people would prefer to talk to their friends face to face, a figure that goes up to 60 per cent in those aged 60 or over.The study of almost 2,000 Brits across the UK, also found that more than half (59 per cent) have online friends they have never met in real life before.Still, more than three quarters of Brits (77 per cent) think life would be harder if they had no pals, a proportion that goes up to 85 per cent for those between 16 and 29.In fact, 85 per cent believe friendship is more important now, what with the pressures of modern life and 84 per cent added that the best moments of their lives were with their mates.Kim Mills, Sponsorship \u0026amp Partnerships Manager at Foxy Bingo said: \u0027At Foxy Bingo, we\u0027re all about our vibrant and friendly online community.\u0027We wanted to take a closer look at modern British friendships, and it\u0027s so interesting to see the regional spread in terms of friendship group sizes, and how people value their friends. \u0027It\u0027s no surprise to see that so many of our friendships are played out online these days, our online chat is more popular than ever and we like to think our online community feel at home with Foxy Bingo.\u0027The research also found that a third (39 per cent) of people have friends they barely see in person, but they would still consider a close companion, while more than a quarter (26 per cent) said life without pals would be unbearable.Nearly a third believed they could count on their friends for absolutely anything, 24 per cent added that their pals mean everything to them and more than a fifth (22 per cent) think their friends know them better than anyone in their lives.One in ten (nine per cent) believe friends to be more important than family, and seven per cent would rather be with their best friend than their partner.On the other hand, a quarter said they had been betrayed by a friend and 11 per cent said there was no one they truly trust, and 16 per cent worried that their mates didn\u0027t really like them.And seven per cent added that they have a frenemy, someone who they secretly dislike, and eight per cent confused they are competitive with the people they call friends.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Burglars lurk grieving mothers garden ransack house","story":"    CCTV footage shows the thieves lurking before smashing into the conservatory where they loot the homeThe thieves had taken Mr Eades watch, iPad as well as throwing his clothes around her bedroom.And Ms Eades says the thieves rummaged through items belonging to her fiancé that she hadn\u0027t touched since his \u0027heartbreaking\u0027 death.Bungling ‘arsonist’ armed with a Molotov cocktail is filmed...Revealed: How David Beckham\u0027s former bodyguard tried to save...Share this articleThe mother-of-two posted the shocking footage on Facebook and wrote:   \u0027So last night at 7pm three absolute scum bags broke into my house. \u0027They smashed in through my conservatory and ransacked our house.

His mum and dad did know already.\u0027We had a few close friends round to watch it on TV last night. It was really exciting because nobody knew how he had done.When quizzed about how the couple planned to spend their fortune, Chloe said: \u0027We have a holiday to Peru planned, which we booked before the show.\u0027We are not very materialistic people, so we won\u0027t splash out on anything elaborate.\u0027If he had won the money or not, we would get married. We had talked about marriage, and the fact he has this money doesn\u0027t change anything.\u0027We may get married this year, but I wouldn\u0027t expect a ring in the next few weeks. If it\u0027s a bit longer that\u0027s also fine.\u0027We have known each other for a really long time. We met at the Alexandra Theatre in Birmingham, I was performing in a show there when I was 16.

heart attack on Monday. The nurse who helped save the life of the Dublin Bus driver who suffered a heart attack while driving through the city centre on Monday has urged people to undergo basic first aid training so they know how to react in an emergency.Aoife McGivney, from Ballinteer in Dublin, administered CPR to a bus driver on Monday morning after the driver fell unconscious and lost control of the bus.Ms McGivney was sitting in the downstairs area of the number 16 Dublin Bus listening to music on her way to work at the Mater Hospital when she realised the bus had broken a red light and was continuing to roll down Westmoreland Street towards O’Connell Bridge. “We crashed into a cyclist and we could feel the bus going over the bike,” Ms McGivney told The . “We thought there was someone under the bus so everyone started screaming.”Ms McGivney approached the front of the bus where she discovered the driver was unconscious. She tried shaking the man to lift his foot from the accelerator and eventually succeeded in moving his leg which allowed the bus to roll to a halt. Meanwhile, a man outside the bus had pulled the emergency lever to open the bus doors. “I said we needed to get the driver onto flat ground or his heart was going to stop. We got him outside the bus and into the recovery position but then I found he had stopped breathing and gone into cardiac arrest. I started CPR and asked people to call an ambulance.”Ms McGivney said she administered a number of cycles of CPR to the man before swapping positions with a passer-by who knew first aid. A garda who was on the scene also helped with the CPR. She says the ambulance arrived within 10 minutes and transported the man to the Mater Hospital. “I know this doesn’t happen often but those few minutes of time you get are so important,” said Ms McGivney who works in the ear, nose and throat department of Mater Hospital. “It’s important that people aren’t afraid to jump in and help, to be able to do something and not have to wait for the ambulance.”Ms McGiveney said she struggled to sleep last night and was quite shaken by Monday’s incident. She is planning to visit the Dublin Bus driver in hospital and hopes he makes a speedy recovery. “I’m so lucky I had my training behind me and knew what to do. The real hereos are the nurses and fire fighters who have to do this every day.”A Garda spokesman confirmed the driver was still in hospital where it is understood he remains in a stable condition. The cyclist hit by the bus was taken to hospital as a precaution but suffered only minor injuries. A spokeswoman for Dublin Bus said all drivers were trained in “comprehensive procedures” for dealing with these types of emergency situations.All vehicles are equipped with a radio which connects with the Dublin Bus central control centre who in turn contact the emergency services, she said.Gardaí are investigating the incident."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3815207.1551810686!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"northern ireland faces grave consequences in no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t David Stirling, head of the NI civil service, said a no-deal would have ‘a profound and long-lasting impact on society’. File photograph:  Charles McQuillanGetty ImagesNorthern Ireland faces “grave” consequences from a no-deal Brexit, including a “sharp increase in unemployment”, a reduced choice of fresh food and the risk of social unrest, the head of the region’s civil service has concluded.The warning from David Sterling comes in a letter to the region’s political parties laying out the expected impact of a hard exit on March 29th.His six-page assessment will heap pressure on Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party, whose 10 MPs in Westminster will play a pivotal role in determining whether Theresa May can build a majority for her Brexit deal as she prepares for a potentially decisive House of Commons vote by March 12th.“The consequences of material business failure as a result of a ‘no-deal’ exit, combined with changes to everyday life and potential border frictions could well have a profound and long-lasting impact on society,” Mr Sterling wrote in an assessment sent to Northern Ireland’s political parties.Noting that the impact would be more severe than elsewhere in the UK, Mr Sterling added there were “very limited actions that could be taken to mitigate” the worst effects.About 800 staff have been trained to run an operations centre in Northern Ireland to co-ordinate the response to a no-deal departure, which the civil service fears could potentially prompt unrest in some communities.‘Scenarios’“The planning assumptions include the possibility that, in some scenarios, a no-deal exit could result in additional challenges for the police if the approach appeared to be unfair or unreasonable for some of those most affected,” the letter said.Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O’Neill said the analysis “again underlines the recklessness of the DUP and the hard-right of the Tory Party who continue to pursue an agenda which is inexorably leading toward a no-deal Brexit”. British officials believe that, partly because of the worries about the economic impact of no deal, the DUP could support Mrs May’s agreement in the Commons next week. The UK government estimates that the Northern Ireland economy will be 9.1 per cent smaller over 15 years under a no-deal scenario.The leadership of the DUP, which provides Mrs May with a majority in Westminster, has recently softened its most trenchant criticisms of the contentious backstop plan for Northern Ireland, which aims to avoid a hard border with the Republic under all circumstances.Downing Street hopes that the party can be won over if the EU offers legal assurances on the temporary nature of the backstop, which would tie Northern Ireland to the EU’s legal order for goods and customs.While businesses have warned that the application of tariffs would “have an impact on jobs within a few weeks”, Mr Sterling said this would be “more acutely” felt in Northern Ireland because of the extent of trading with the Republic. ‘Cumulative effect’He added that Northern Irish businesses “are not adequately prepared for a no-deal outcome”, especially in the agri-food sector, which has “very small profit margins”.“The cumulative effect of the inability of businesses to prepare, the impact of EU tariffs and significant changes to the regulatory export environment for businesses here could result in business distress, failure or the relocation of some companies to Ireland and as a consequence... a sharp increase in unemployment,” Mr Sterling wrote.The letter said there was “no material risk of an overall food shortage”. But Mr Sterling warned that disruption would affect supply chains to supermarkets and the range of products available. “There is likely... to be some reduction in the choice of food available, particularly some fresh produce,” he concluded.“In effect, there is currently no mitigation available for the severe consequences of a no-deal outcome,” Mr Sterling wrote. “These consequences do not arise from the possibility of checks or controls on either side of the land border, but would simply be the direct consequence of the legal position that would apply.”Responding to the letter, Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said there “should be no surprises” in what Mr Sterling has told the political parties. “Business leaders have been saying this for over a year. A no-deal Brexit would be disastrous for our economy, for jobs and for our households. A no-deal Brexit will mean a hard border as both the UK and the EU must protect the integrity of their markets,” he said.

Photograph: Delil SouleimanAFPGetty ImagesHundreds more people have left the last area held by the Islamic State terror group in eastern Syria and gathered in a massive reception area to be searched and screened by US-backed fighters.Some of those who gathered outside the village of Baghouz said they had been waiting since the previous night when hundreds left the pocket held by Islamic State, also known as Isis. The latest wave of evacuations brings closer the final defeat of the extremists’ so-called “caliphate” at the hands of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. Officers from the US-led coalition were screening the men who left the Islammic State-held area to determine if they were militants or civilians.The exodus came three days after the US-backed forces resumed their push on militants holed up in Baghouz on the banks of the Euphrates River, close to the Iraqi border. In the past few weeks, thousands of civilians left the speck of territory in organised evacuations following an earlier halt in fighting.The Kurdish-led forces said their fighters were surprised by the large number of civilians, including Islanic State family members, cooped up in the tiny area squeezed smaller and smaller by intermittent offensives.The US-backed forces slowed their push on Baghouz last week to allow civilians to leave the tiny enclave. Asked about the situation inside Baghouz, a Russian woman who came out with her three children responded in broken Arabic: “Fear.” She said her husband had died.Intense bombingAnother woman in her mid-20s, who identified herself as Reem, from the central Syrian province of Hama, said she was waiting for her husband to come out of an Islamic State-controlled jail. He had been there for months after killing an Islamic State member in retaliation “for his baby daughter being killed in an air strike”, she said.“I haven’t seen him since and don’t know where he is,” Reem said, adding that she had asked repeatedly for his whereabouts before deciding to leave.The evacuees said the bombing was intense over the past few days. One woman said she saw a man hit by a missile as she was escaping from one tent to another. Another woman said many were waiting to leave and that the scene was chaotic at the safe passage area.Earlier on Tuesday, SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali, said about 3,000 people had come out of Baghouz on Monday. They left through a humanitarian corridor established by Kurdish-led forces for those who wanted to leave or surrender.Since February 20th, more than 10,000 people have left the Islamic State pocket, often in dramatic scenes of black-robed women with children in the back of trucks passing through the corridor and heading into the desert. They were then whisked off to a camp for displaced people to the north, while suspected Islamic State fighters were moved to detention facilities.Retaking the last Islamic State-held enclave in Baghouz would be a milestone in the devastating four-year campaign to end the group’s self-proclaimed caliphate that once covered a vast territory straddling Syria and Iraq. Mr Bali said a large number among those who left on Monday were Islamic State fighters who had “surrendered to our forces”.It is unclear how many Islamic State militants and civilians remain inside, but the number is thought to be in the hundreds. – AP"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3815337.1551810332!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bombs sent to london airports and waterloo came from ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA  police cordon at London’s Waterloo Station, implemented after a suspicious package was reported.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill‘I never wanted to be part of the German empire’For some living in Britain today, applying for an Irish passport is an expression of resistance to Brexit or a reawakening of a long-dormant connection to Ireland. For others it is nothing more than a desire to get through airport security more quickly.Tony Flemming, a Manchester native whose mother came from Athlone, voted to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum. He applied for Irish citizenship last year.“I want to go on holiday to Europe, and it would be easier with an Irish passport,” Flemming (73) says. “And the second reason I got it was just to see if I could.“I will use my Irish passport on the journey out and then switch to my British passport when returning home, so it’s quicker through security.”Despite being the new owner of a European travel document, Flemming said he “never wanted to be part of the ‘German empire’.”He added, “I’ve been hoping for Brexit for a long time. I just want to get out and get it sorted.”His children voted to remain in the EU.“My children have said I’m hypocritical,” said Flemming. “I think it’s perfectly normal to take advantage of a system if the option is there.”He was once a regular visitor to Ireland, but the last trip was during the 1966 World Cup. However, his dual citizenship is intended for sunnier travels.“I like to go to Gibraltar, so my British passport will be fine until I walk over to Spain, and then I’ll use my Irish one.”Flemming is not alone. Last year the passport service received 200,000 applications from British-based people directly to Dublin or through its office in London – although the largest share are for the children of Irish-born citizens living in Britain.‘This has opened up my Irish roots’Jim Greer (56), a social work lecturer from Scotland, spent €250 accumulating his grandmother’s birth, marriage and death certificates and a further €278 on an application for Irish citizenship.“Ireland was the only EU country I was eligible to apply for. I didn’t actually realise I was eligible until Brexit happened,” he says.Living in Scotland, where 62 per cent of residents voted to remain, Greer pursued Irish citizenship as a “symbol of resistance to Brexit”.“It is just not my outlook at all,” he says. “It feels less like we’re being dragged out of the EU as we’re being dragged into some English flag-waving, spitfire era.His paternal grandmother grew up in Ballymena, Co Antrim, before moving across to the west coast of Scotland.“She was actually a very staunch Protestant, so she would be turning in her grave right now,” says Greer, who visited Northern Ireland many times in his youth but has yet to set foot in the Republic.He spent six months learning about the country, listening to the Irish Passport Podcast, a series to educate aspiring Irish citizens on the country’s culture, history and politics.“I’ve found a new dimension. I always thought of myself as Scottish, but this has opened up my Irish roots. I might even consider living there.”‘Brexit doesn’t feel like such a big issue to me now’Londoners Rachel and Bill Bohling got their Irish passports at the same time as their mother, Cathy, who grew up in Co Tyrone.“We were quite delayed as a family in getting them, as we’ve been entitled to one all our lives,” says Rachel (26). “Our mum was very emotionally involved. She was pushing us to get them ever since Brexit.”With her boyfriend living in Paris, Rachel’s new passport gave her the confidence to look into transferring offices to France.“Brexit doesn’t feel like such a big issue to me now. I don’t think it can impact me the way it could before.”While Bill (31) has no immediate plans, having an Irish passport keeps the door to Europe open.“I personally love being European and having that option to travel,” he said.He speaks fondly about family trips to Ireland, where they visited relatives north and south of the Border.“I’ve always felt very appreciative of my mum’s heritage. That Irish root is very important to me. I’m a proud British and Irish citizen.”‘My mum jokes that I never cared about being Irish until now’Self-confessed pessimist Matthew Modlinsky (44) applied for an Irish passport just two weeks after the Brexit referendum.“I like to be prepared for the worst,” says Modlinsky, a transport co-ordinator. “I’m even stocking up on food now: cans of chickpeas, tinned tomatoes, nothing perishable.”His mother moved from Monaghan to Manchester when she was 16.“It’s just pure luck that my mum is Irish. I see other people who feel the same as me who aren’t as lucky.”His mother goes back each year to see family, but Modlinsky has visited the island just once.“My mum jokes that I never cared about being Irish until now. I know that’s terrible. Now that I’m an Irish citizen I should go more. I do plan to go.”A keen traveller, he hopes his new passport will make European trips easy. In the long-term, he plans to retire to France or Spain.“I don’t want to be restricted in what I do. That’s the travesty of it all. It’s not my generation, it’s the younger generation who are having an opportunity taken away from them.”‘I’ve enjoyed the freedoms of the EU for so long’Although Amy McCollam (40) only applied for her passport last year, she began researching Irish citizenship long before Brexit.“Ireland is a big part of me it’s home. I did all my important growing up there,” she said.When she was 13 her family moved to Ballymena, her father’s hometown. She lived there for seven years, before returning to England to study.Now, McCollam lives in Reading and is applying for Irish citizenship for her daughter, Keira, through foreign birth registration.“I want her to understand part of where she comes from,” said McCollam. “I’ve enjoyed the freedoms of the EU for so long and I love it, so I want her to have it.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

File photograph: Peter NichollsReutersTheresa May’s top government lawyer and Brexit minister are heading to Brussels on Tuesday afternoon in a last-ditch bid to secure changes to get her Brexit deal through parliament and smooth the UK’s departure from the European Union.The UK is due to leave the EU in 24 days, but parliament’s rejection of Mrs May’s deal earlier this year has put in doubt how, when, or possibly even if, Britain’s biggest foreign and trade policy shift in more than 40 years will take place.Mrs May has charged her team, attorney general Geoffrey Cox and Brexit minister Stephen Barclay, with securing changes to the backstop, the insurance policy to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic if a future trading relationship falls short.Mr Cox and Mr Barclay will hold a 90-minute meeting with the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier and other officials from the bloc on Tuesday, followed by further discussions over dinner.They are hoping to build on what Mrs May’s team calls “progress” in talks to find a compromise that would rule out the UK leaving without a deal, a nightmare scenario for many businesses.“We all want to leave at the end of this month and it depends how quickly we can get a deal through,” foreign minister Jeremy Hunt told BBC radio, describing the situation as having been “transformed in a positive direction” over the last month.“Our ask of the EU is an important ask ... but it is one ask and it’s a simple one. We need substantive changes that will allow the attorney general to change his advice to the government that says that, at the moment, theoretically, we could be trapped in the backstop indefinitely.”Mrs May has struggled to convince the EU that she can get the deal through a deeply ided parliament in London, where lawmakers are increasingly flexing their muscles to try to influence the UK’s departure from the bloc.She has offered lawmakers the chance to seek to prevent a no-deal departure and to delay Brexit if parliament rejects the deal in a vote she has promised to hold by March 12th.Both British and EU officials have said any delay would not be lengthy, probably a few months.Ministers are hoping Mr Cox can convince eurosceptic lawmakers he has done enough to remove the threat of Britain ending up in the EU’s customs union indefinitely, something Brexit supporters say would make a mockery of the 2016 vote to leave the bloc.The British government had been looking at either an end date on the provision or some way of London being able to stop the arrangement unilaterally, but have in recent days been less specific about what the changes would amount to.One minister said the change would most probably come in an addendum to the agreement – something the government hopes will be enough to change minds in parliament, where deep isions over Brexit have become increasingly entrenched.“How we get there is something we’re prepared to be flexible about,” Mr Hunt said. “But the crucial thing that we are looking for is to see whether Geoffrey Cox is going to be able to change his advice to the government.” – ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

times as Naughty, who sits on his lap while he holds a bottle of sparkling wine. In the footage, obtained by The Sun, Sir Philip is sitting on a black leather sofa with a woman in dark trousers and a patterned top on his knee. While a man walks around the room checking his mobile phone, Sir Philip and the woman discuss her job. He can be seen playing with her hair. A third man can be heard behind the camera directing the video. With the camera recording, Sir Philip says he is very upset the unnamed employee is leaving us adding that somehow we\u0027ll manage, as he pulls the woman known as Naughty closer to him. Sir Philip then says: So Naughty is now going to look after me instead of you, before audibly kissing her on the cheek three times.Having filmed the piece to camera, the woman stands up and sits on the arm of the sofa with the tape still rolling.Sir Philip then gestures for her to sit back down next to him before the interviewer behind the camera asks what the former employee was like to work with. Sir Philip responds: In the meanwhile, I\u0027ve got Naughty. Lucky me, as he shuffles along the sofa towards her and puts his arm around her before pulling back and rubbing her cheek with the back of his finger. An investigation by The  into Sir Philip revealed him to be the businessman at the heart of sexual and racial harassment claims.Sir Philip paid a female executive more than £1 million as part of a settlement agreement after she accused the retail tycoon of groping her in a series of allegations that were only disclosed after a six-month legal battle.He is also alleged to have racially abused a senior black employee, telling him that his “problem” was that he was still throwing spears in the jungle.The black member of staff received around £1 million, while two other female employees were paid hundreds of thousands of pounds each after complaining of Sir Philip’s “inappropriate” behaviour that included “grabbing” one woman by the face and putting another in a “headlock”.Five complainants each signed a gagging clause  – known as a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) – in return for the pay-offs.The  was able to make public for the first time details of the allegations after the High Court action brought by the billionaire

believe nude portrait work leonardo da vinci","story":"The charcoal sketch of a nude woman will be  included in an exhibition set to be held in Chantilly later this year to mark the 500th anniversary of Da Vinci\u0026#39s deathA charcoal drawing of a nude woman who bears a striking resemblance to the Mona Lisa may be the work of Leonardo Da Vinci, according to experts at the Louvre.The drawing, known as the Monna Vanna, has long been believed to have been produced by his studio, but not necessarily by the Renaissance master himself.Experts at the Louvre in Paris, which houses the world’s largest collection of Leonardo’s work, including the Mona Lisa, now believe that the nude is probably his work.It will be included in a special exhibition at Chantilly later this year to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Da Vinci’s death.The drawing is a preparatory sketch for a painting of a semi-nude woman and is housed at the Condé Museum at the château of Chantilly, 25 miles north of Paris, according to experts.The Monna Vanna was previously believed to be the work of apprentices in Da Vinci\u0026#39s studioMathieu Deldicque, a Louvre curator, said microscopic examinations revealed that the Monna Vanna was drawn from the top left to the bottom right, suggesting that it is the work of a left-handed artist. Leonardo is the world’s most famous left-handed painter.“There is a very strong possibility that Leonardo did most of the drawing,” said Mr Deldicque, who initiated months of examinations of the sketch by historians and scientists at the Centre for Research and Restoration of the Museums of France. The centre, which has a reputation for reliability, studies and restores works of art housed in more than 1,200 museums across France. It uses high-tech scientific equipment to analyse and date them.The Louvre is extremely cautious about attributing artworks to Leonardo. Its experts have reportedly concluded that the world’s most expensive painting, the Salvator Mundi, attributed to Leonardo when it was sold for a record $450 million (£342 million) in 2017, is not his work after all. The museum is understood to have cancelled plans to include it in a forthcoming Leonardo exhibition.But the Louvre is giving the Monna Vanna the benefit of the doubt.The Mona Lisa is widely acclaimed as the best known painting in the worldBruno Mottin, a conservation expert at the museum, had earlier confirmed that the drawing on paper dated from the lifetime of Leonardo, who died in France in 1519. He was unsure whether it was the work of the polymath himself because of “hatching on the top of the drawing near the head done by a right-handed person”.The drawing uses one of the hallmarks of Leonardo’s work, the “sfumato” technique, which softens transitions between colours, mimicking an area beyond what the eye focusses on, known as the “out-of-focus plane”. Da Vinci was the most prominent practitioner of this technique, which he employed in the Mona Lisa.Nevertheless, Mr Deldicque cautioned: “We must remain prudent. We want to be serious and scientific about this. The quality of the drawing, both to the naked eye and under imaging analysis reveals the work of an exceptional hand. But we cannot be absolutely certain that it is the work of Leonardo and we may never be.”Comment: Chris Grayling is so shameless, it’s almost heroicLondon explosive devices: \u0026#39Irish dissident plot\u0026#39 could be behind packages as counter-terror police investigate Leaving Neverland: everything we know about the new Michael Jackson documentary airing on Channel 4Comment: Why is it that only Left-wingers can enjoy the privilege of double standards?Game of Thrones season 8 trailer: watch Arya face death and dragons in the final teaserBrexit latest news: Donald Tusk claims \u0026#39external anti-European forces\u0026#39 tried to influence 2016 EU referendumComment: Dear Mr Macron, your arrogance will only make Europe’s problems worseAsh Wednesday and Lent 2019: When fasting starts and the meaning behind itGame Of Thrones\u0026#39 Battle of Winterfell: all we know about the longest battle scene ever filmed\u0026#39A slow-burn crisis\u0026#39: how Ebola will take months to resolve SNP\u0026#39s \u0026#39shoddy\u0026#39 planning blamed for leaving NHS in the grip of a recruitment crisisAdvances in stem cell treatment give hope to millions with \u0026#39incurable\u0026#39 diseasesFrom ignorance to a potential cure: the history of HIV breakthroughsKent to become international wine tasting holiday destination as 2018 heatwave produces vintage year for English and Welsh wineThe Independent Group begin talks with Electoral Commission about becoming fully-fledged partyMini drones will be used by the Army to spy on terrorists inside buildings, MoD announcesKylie Jenner becomes youngest self-made billionaire, according to Forbes, through Instagram-driven makeup businessAC Grayling wins £20,000 libel claim against Twitter user who said he was paedophileWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/03/05/TELEMMGLPICT000134387906_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"kent become international wine tasting holiday destination 2018","story":"Chapel Down Winery in KentKent is set to become an international wine tasting destination after a record year for English and Welsh wine, with production tripling and exports doubling in 2018.The heatwave caused a bumper harvest last year, and experts have said that it will be a vintage year for wine in Britain.Now, visitors are beginning to come from around the world to go on wine-tasting holidays in Kent, Sussex and Wales.The south-east of England features the most active vineyards, attracting the most tourists, as the wine garden of Kent and clusters of vineyards in Sussex and Hampshire work together to offer wine tastings.Wine tasting holidays are already winning awards. Winemakers Hush Heath, part of the Kent group, recently opened a tasting room and winery, which won a VisitEngland Visitor Attraction award last year.Bolney wine estate in Sussex have built a new restaurant and wine tasting room as well as creating nature walks around their vines, in order to capitalise on the wine tourism industry and teach people about their wines.A spokesperson from Wines of Great Britain said that English and Welsh wine is particularly attractive to American tourists.She said Wine tourism globally has become a very popular leisure pastime.It\u0027s a combination of the two, the majority of visitors are domestic, that includes \u0027staycationers\u0027, but we are definitely setting our sights on attracting more overseas visitors. The US is a prime target as they are the majority consumer of our exports.This is yet another way we can attract American tourists to Britain.Miles Beale, Chief Executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said: “It’s extremely exciting that in 2018 UK wine makers have produced volumes that near-triple the number of bottles made the previous year. This is down to the gutsy English and Welsh wine businesses and all those investing in them to grow vineyards, create fantastic wines rivalling the best in the world and develop amazing places to visit.Last summer’s record heatwave provided near perfect grape growing conditions and a bumper harvest with UK winemakers predicting that when it starts being released, 2018 is likely to prove a vintage year. This will prove vital to maintaining the reputation of English and Welsh wine as it grows – including its exports.”Guy Barter, chief horticulturalist at the Royal Horticultural Society added: It was a year in a hundred for grapes, I\u0027ve never seen anything like it before, not even in 1976.We are certainly going to see more grapes and more wine being produced.Normally British grape juice is rather acid, that makes a rather mouth puckering wine, the heat, light and late autumn meant they were full of sugar.This made the best wine.

The strike and a later jet dogfight brought the neighbours to their worst military confrontation in two decades.Pakistan is widely accused of harbouring and sponsoring militant groups to project power in India and Afghanistan. Western officials have judged previous crackdowns to be mainly for show. JeM has been banned in Pakistan since 2002, but according to a US State Department assessment last year, it was still able to recruit, fundraise and train freely.At least 40 paramilitary police were killed in a February 14 suicide bombing claimed by Jaish-e-MohammadA statement released on Tuesday said Pakistan had “decided to speed up action against all proscribed organisations”.Gen Talat Masood, a former senior military officer, said he believed this crackdown would be serious, because the government and military had come to view the groups as a liability.He said: “Even if they had any utility at one point, now they don\u0027t and they are a drag.”Threats to put Pakistan on a terrorist financing blacklist unless it takes more action have also weighed on the government and powerful military establishment, he said. Pakistan\u0027s economy is already groaning under a balance of payments crisis and can ill afford international sanctions.“I think this time it will be more effective,” he said.JeM claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing of a paramilitary police convoy in Pulwama in Indian-controlled Kashmir on February 14.

But it\u0027s better than what they have today. Please review our commenting policyComment: Chris Grayling is so shameless, it’s almost heroicLondon explosive devices: \u0026#39Irish dissident plot\u0026#39 could be behind packages as counter-terror police investigate Leaving Neverland: everything we know about the new Michael Jackson documentary airing on Channel 4Comment: Why is it that only Left-wingers can enjoy the privilege of double standards?Game of Thrones season 8 trailer: watch Arya face death and dragons in the final teaserBrexit latest news: Donald Tusk claims \u0026#39external anti-European forces\u0026#39 tried to influence 2016 EU referendumComment: Dear Mr Macron, your arrogance will only make Europe’s problems worseAsh Wednesday and Lent 2019: When fasting starts and the meaning behind itGame Of Thrones\u0026#39 Battle of Winterfell: all we know about the longest battle scene ever filmed\u0026#39A slow-burn crisis\u0026#39: how Ebola will take months to resolve SNP\u0026#39s \u0026#39shoddy\u0026#39 planning blamed for leaving NHS in the grip of a recruitment crisisAdvances in stem cell treatment gives hope to millions with \u0026#39incurable\u0026#39 diseasesFrom ignorance to a potential cure: the history of HIV breakthroughsKent to become international wine tasting holiday destination as 2018 heatwave produces vintage year for English and Welsh wineThe Independent Group begin talks with Electoral Commission about becoming fully-fledged partyMini drones will be used by the Army to spy on terrorists inside buildings, MoD announcesKylie Jenner becomes youngest self-made billionaire, according to Forbes, through Instagram-driven makeup businessAC Grayling wins £20,000 libel claim against Twitter user who said he was paedophileWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/25/12/brexit-so-far-1.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6030851  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Brexit campaign  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/25/12/brexit-so-far-1.jpg","title":"brexit bank england ecb currency emergency swap euro pound","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

It is at this point that central banks will be available to provide cash through so-called swap lines.There had been some speculation that the ECB would not support a euro swap line if no Brexit deal is agreed with the UK.But the ECB and BoE confirmed on Tuesday that the facility will be available.The ECB said it will continue to work closely with the Bank of England to monitor market conditions carefully.In its latest health check of the financial system, the BoE also warned that some disruption to cross-border services is possible and, in the absence of other actions by EU authorities, some potential risks to financial stability remain.Although these would primarily affect EU households and businesses, they could also be expected to spill back to the UK in ways that cannot be fully anticipated and mitigated, it added in a statement.However, the BoE\u0026nbspsaid banks, insurers and other key parts of the UK financial system had to a large extent protected themselves from the risks of Brexit.The remarks came in minutes published on Tuesday of\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspFinancial Policy Committee (FPC) meeting held on 26 February.Laith Khalaf, senior analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown said the BoE\u0026nbsphad given a clean bill of health to banks and insuruers\u0026nbspahead of Brexit.The Bank does expect volatility in market prices if a no-deal Brexit materialises, which will come as a surprise to precisely no-one.However what is interesting is that the central bank’s numbers show the heightened risk associated with Brexit has at least been partly factored into UK share prices.\u0026nbspNo-one knows whether the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal, and given the range of political permutations it’s not even possible to robustly assign a probability to either outcome, let alone what the financial implications might be.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It looked a bit like one of those odd shaped potatoes in the middle of a tray full of the perfectly ones that\u0026nbspthe supermarkets used to insist were the only ones shoppers would buy.\u0026nbspNo these aren’t official figures, as grocers are typically only too keen to remind everyone of\u0026nbspwhen they don’t come out of them looking good. But they are closely watched because they are based on an admirably comprehensive survey - the shopping data submitted by a 30,000 strong panel. \u0026nbspSainsbury’s and Asda criticise watchdog over merger findingsSainsbury’s-Asda merger at risk as CMA says deal could push up pricesAsda and Sainsbury’s top brass will benefit from the mergerThat data showed that Sainsbury’s sales declined by 1 per cent. Worse still, from the point of view of pride, is that its sluggish performance (this is no one off) means it should soon surrender its position as Britain’s number two supermarket to its proposed merger partner, which has been revived somewhat.\u0026nbspSainsbury’s now has 15.7 per cent, Asda 15.5 per cent. The corresponding figures this time last year were 16.2 per cent and 15.6 per cent, which ought to give Sainsbury’s investors pause for some serious thought.\u0026nbspMuch of the focus following the figures’ release - hot on the heels of a set of numbers from Barclaycard - focussed on the rather mixed evidence of pre Brexit stockpiling (people say they’re looking at it but the figures aren’t picking it up yet).\u0026nbspWere Theresa May’s one policy of note not threatening to drop a bomb on all of the supermarkets, and on all of us too, Asda’s renewed vim ought to have\u0026nbspmade it an attractive target for someone other than Sainsbury’s\u0026nbspby now. Owner Walmart is none too keen on hanging around.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s\u0026nbspprobably working on plan B right now.Sainsbury’s, by contrast, looks rather like what Britain’s going to look like when its dismal Conservative government has finished doing its worst: Ailing while looking enviously across at its rivals.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

It is at this point that central banks will be available to provide cash through so-called swap lines.There had been some speculation that the ECB would not support a euro swap line if no Brexit deal is agreed with the UK.But the ECB and BoE confirmed on Tuesday that the facility will be available.The ECB said it will continue to work closely with the Bank of England to monitor market conditions carefully.In its latest health check of the financial system, the BoE also warned that some disruption to cross-border services is possible and, in the absence of other actions by EU authorities, some potential risks to financial stability remain.Although these would primarily affect EU households and businesses, they could also be expected to spill back to the UK in ways that cannot be fully anticipated and mitigated, it added in a statement.However, the BoE\u0026nbspsaid banks, insurers and other key parts of the UK financial system had to a large extent protected themselves from the risks of Brexit.The remarks came in minutes published on Tuesday of\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspFinancial Policy Committee (FPC) meeting held on 26 February.Laith Khalaf, senior analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown said the BoE\u0026nbsphad given a clean bill of health to banks and insuruers\u0026nbspahead of Brexit.The Bank does expect volatility in market prices if a no-deal Brexit materialises, which will come as a surprise to precisely no-one.However what is interesting is that the central bank’s numbers show the heightened risk associated with Brexit has at least been partly factored into UK share prices.\u0026nbspNo-one knows whether the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal, and given the range of political permutations it’s not even possible to robustly assign a probability to either outcome, let alone what the financial implications might be.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Aircraft flying at altitude create additional warming effects, including the formation of contrails and clouds.\u0026nbspCurrently these are not incorporated in company disclosures, or in the models used to benchmark them, even though they are likely to be significant.Faith Ward, co-chair of TPI on behalf of the Environment Agency Pension Fund, said “Investors have a clear message to the aviation sector: When it comes to carbon performance they must be in it for the long haul. That means setting stretching emissions reduction targets to 2030 and beyond, and ending a reliance on offsetting. It’s clear from TPI’s research that this is not currently the case.”“Offsetting is no substitute for a clear strategy to reduce emissions, and the IEA’s carbon budget for air transport excludes the use of offsets. The aviation sector is doing the basics when it comes to carbon performance, but investors are urging them to take more significant steps as they judge which airlines are most likely to survive the turbulence of the transition to a low carbon economy. “Helena Viñes Fiestas, deputy head of sustainability at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said: “The aviation industry clearly has a range of actions it can take to respond to climate change - improved energy efficiency, bio fuels, and offsetting amongst others. As investors, we need clarity about the contribution each of these will make - and, critically, how much they will cost - if the sector is to make its contribution to the goals of the Paris Agreement.“We’ll tell you what’s true.

The fact they are tipped over also seems to push them further apart, researchers\u0026nbspYale astronomers Sarah Millholland and Gregory Laughlin\u0026nbspsaid.More than 100 new exoplanets found“When planets such as these have large axial tilts, as opposed to little or no tilt, their tides are exceedingly more efficient at draining orbital energy into heat in the planets,” said first author\u0026nbspMillholland, a graduate student at Yale. “This vigorous tidal dissipation pries the orbits apart.”Earth and its moon are in a similar formation. The moon\u0027s orbit is slowly growing, but Earth\u0027s day is gradually lengthening, as the two go apart.The tilting seems to decide a whole range of features about the planets.“It impacts several of their physical features, such as their climate, weather, and global circulations,”\u0026nbspLaughlin\u0026nbspsaid. “The seasons on a planet with a large axial tilt are much more extreme than those on a well-aligned planet, and their weather patterns are probably non-trivial.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They were discovered inside the remains of Cuban crocodiles\u0026nbspfound in\u0026nbspQueen Elizabeth II Botanic Park, Grand Cayman.Professor Samuel Turvey, senior research fellow at ZSL’s Institute of Zoology, said: “Humans are almost certainly to blame for the extinction of these newly described mammals, and this represents just the tip of the iceberg for mammal extinctions in the Caribbean.“Nearly all the mammal species that used to live on these tropical islands, including all of the native Caribbean sloths and monkeys, have recently disappeared.“It’s vitally important to understand the factors responsible for past extinctions of island species, as many threatened species today are found on islands. The handful of Caribbean mammals that still exist today are the last survivors of a unique vanished world and represent some of the world’s top conservation priorities.”One of the newly discovered extinct rodents,\u0026nbspCapromys pilorides lewisi\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspGeocapromys caymanensis, is believed to have been recorded by the English explorer Francis Drake.

Their closest living relative is Desmarest\u0027s hutia, which are widespread in Cuba and can grow to a weight of 8.5kg.The researchers believe the Cayman Islands may have been colonised by mammals carried across from Cuba on rafts of vegetation, which have been documented to float as far as 60 miles in less than a week.1990s\u0026nbsp(New Mexico Museum of Natural History)Professor Ross MacPhee of the AMNH’s mammalogy department, said: Although one would think that the greatest days of biological field discoveries are long over, that\u0027s very far from the case.With only one possible sighting early in the course of European expansion into the New World, these small mammals from the Cayman Islands were complete unknowns until their fossils were discovered.“Their closest relatives are Cuban how and when did they manage a 250km journey over open water?We’ll tell you what’s true.

If they are ministers they would be expected to resign, or get sacked.“Free” votes are usually reserved for well-established issues of conscience – notably matters such as abortion, capital punishment, fox hunting – and for relatively minor bits of uncontentious legislation, including, sometimes, private members’ bills.Occasionally they can be used as a way of pressuring the opposition parties to also offer a free vote – assuming the margin of advantage in such tactics lies with the government. (The opposite is also true).Created with Sketch.

Yet that is precisely what is being openly discussed, most recently by the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt.Labour to order MPs to vote for second Brexit referendum amendmentIn the crucial vote on a no-deal Brexit expected next week, Theresa May and (most of) her cabinet are desperate to keep the option on the table. That does not necessarily mean they want that to be the outcome – quite the opposite in nearly all cases, though some view it with greater revulsion than others. Rather, they believe, rightly or wrongly, that it is an essential part of their negotiating armoury, even though it is common knowledge in Britain and Europe that it is no more than a bluff.The problem for Ms May is that the no-deal scenario is viewed with such horror by the great majority in the Commons that any attempt to keep it open as an option is futile. As has been obvious for some time, there are only about 50 to 100 MPs who could be said actively to prefer that outcome (ie leaving on World Trade Organisation terms) to the other options available.That means the other 550 to 600 are actively opposed to it a majority of 450 against the no-deal option. Even if a fair number of Tory MPs followed her into the ision lobby against their better judgement on a whipped vote, the prime minister would still face an even larger defeat than the historic one she suffered a few weeks ago when her withdrawal deal with rejected (by 432 votes to 202). \u0026nbspDefeat, then, for the government on no-deal Brexit – even on a whipped vote – is inevitable, because the rebellion within the parliamentary Conservative party would be so great as to guarantee it. Worse, arguably, it would mean significant resignations from the Cabinet and wider government.Cabinet members Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark have written newspaper articles declaring as much some 15 to 20 ministers of state are also rumoured to be ready to quit – some have publicly stated that they would.Therefore, in order to save face and make the best of a bad job, Ms May will have to accept the device of a free vote in order to avoid utter humiliation.Such a prospect though merely draws attention to the political fact of life that has been obvious ever since she lost her overall majority and her moral authority in her snap election last year she has no majority in the Commons for her government nor for her flagship policy.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

But given parliament looks set to extend Article 50, there’ll be further opportunities to secure support for Labour’s alternative Brexit deal.“This would bring the country together and defend jobs, rights and our security.”Labour’s David Lammy, a supporter of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “It’s become clear today that there is no majority in the house for May’s deal, but also that Labour’s alternative plan cannot command a majority either.“In the key votes ahead of us we must extend Article 50 to take a catastrophic no deal off the table and use that time to put this decision back to the people to decide if they back the government’s botched Brexit deal or staying in our current EU deal.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Small clay boxes were among the other vessels found.Mr De Anda said the objects were “completely untouched”.Created with Sketch.

The offerings were meant to ask for rain, the experts believe.\u0026nbspIt emerged that the cave had been discovered, but not fully explored, by local people around 50 years ago.They told an archaeologist about the cave\u0026nbspbut he ordered it sealed – possibly to protect it – and only issued a brief report that was forgotten in Mexican government archives.The archaeologists studying the objects plan to leave them all in the cave after their analysis.Known as Balamku, the cave is about 1.7 miles east of the main pyramid of Kukulkan, also known as El Castillo or “The Castle”.Kukulcan Pyramid at the Mayan archaeological site of Chichen Itza (AFPGetty Images)Mr De Anda and his team have been exploring Chichen Itza to establish the routes and sites of the Mayan underground water system.A series of sinkhole lakes known as cenotes are visible on the surface of the site, but there are other, undiscovered water sites beneath the labyrinth of pyramids, patios and temples.Water was always central to Chichen Itza, whose name means “at the mouth of the well of the water wizards” in the Maya language.Mr De Anda said experts had crawled a few hundred metres into the cave, which in places is just 40cm high, in hopes of finding the connection to a cenote believed to lie under the pyramid of Kukulkan.“Let’s hope this leads us there. That is part of the reason why we are entering these sites, to find a connection to the cenote under the Castillo,” he said.Additional reporting by Associated PressWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Google has allowed the app to remain on its Google Play store and Apple’s investigation continues.Google told the office of Congresswoman Jackie\u0026nbspSpeier, one of the letter’s signatories, that the investigation concluded the app does not breach any agreements, according to Fortune.Under Saudi Arabia’s restrictive ship laws, women cannot travel without permission from their male s and male relatives have a final say over a woman marrying. Critics say the app serves as the practical and technological arm of the repressive rules that restrict and inhibit countless aspects of everyday life for women in the country.Absher, which roughly translates as “yes sir”, allows men to turn on notifications that alert them with a text message any time a woman under their ship goes through an airport.Saudi Arabia prepares to prosecute women’s rights activistsAbsher, which has been downloaded more than one million times, also allows citizens to complete a range of bureaucratic tasks, such as renewing driver’s licences to male s and giving women permission to seek a job, which is legally required in Saudi Arabia. It also has features that send alerts if a woman leaves a certain area – making it difficult for women to leave without the permission of a “male ”.Ilhan Omar, a Democrat elected to the House of\u0026nbspRepresentatives who is\u0026nbspone of the signatories, tweeted: “Women are not your property! Women are not your property! Women are not your property! So why are @Apple and @Google hosting an app that allows men to track and control women’s movement in Saudi Arabia? This insanity needs to end!”Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who sent a separate letter to Apple and Google, said: “American companies should not enable or facilitate the Saudi government’s patriarchy.”Brother of Saudi activist ‘being tortured’ fears treatment worseningHe added: “By permitting the app in your respective stores, your companies are making it easier for Saudi men to control their family members from the convenience of their smartphones and restrict their movements. This flies in the face of the type of society you both claim to support and defend.”Google and Apple’s decision to host the app has sparked criticism from Human Rights Watch, which said the tech companies were “facilitating human rights abuses”.Representatives for Google and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Aircraft flying at altitude create additional warming effects, including the formation of contrails and clouds.\u0026nbspCurrently these are not incorporated in company disclosures, or in the models used to benchmark them, even though they are likely to be significant.Faith Ward, co-chair of TPI on behalf of the Environment Agency Pension Fund, said “Investors have a clear message to the aviation sector: When it comes to carbon performance they must be in it for the long haul. That means setting stretching emissions reduction targets to 2030 and beyond, and ending a reliance on offsetting. It’s clear from TPI’s research that this is not currently the case.”“Offsetting is no substitute for a clear strategy to reduce emissions, and the IEA’s carbon budget for air transport excludes the use of offsets. The aviation sector is doing the basics when it comes to carbon performance, but investors are urging them to take more significant steps as they judge which airlines are most likely to survive the turbulence of the transition to a low carbon economy. “Helena Viñes Fiestas, deputy head of sustainability at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said: “The aviation industry clearly has a range of actions it can take to respond to climate change - improved energy efficiency, bio fuels, and offsetting amongst others. As investors, we need clarity about the contribution each of these will make - and, critically, how much they will cost - if the sector is to make its contribution to the goals of the Paris Agreement.“We’ll tell you what’s true.

It’s coming soon . . . and it’s going to be ruddy marvellous.I don’t think I’m giving too much away when I say there will be some big personalities trying to work as a team. And that’s always seriously entertaining.But also, the thing about The Apprentice is that none of the celebs realise when they sign up that it is probably the single most full-on thing they will ever do in their le.How do I know this  I was a ­contestant in  Lord Sugar’s aide.And when Lord Sugar asked meI would be on the Comic Relief show, I honestly thought: “How hard can it be ” How wrong I was.The girls asked me to be their project leader and we all quickly found out that you don’t know how much you will do for charity until you are part of an event raising money for Comic Relief. There is almost no limit.Also, it’s hard to do justice to the exhaustion. We were on the go from am until midnight. I was surviving on about two hours’ sleep a night.Probably my most vivid memory of the  show is cleaning two tonne of squid — what we misguidedly decided to serve at the fun fair we were organising. I was the only one who knew how to clean squid.Plus, as project manager I decided to take most of the rubbish jobs myself. And cleaning squid is very messy, as each one squirts ink.Just when I was pretty much ­covered in the stuff, I got a call from Trinny Woodall, who’d gone home to put her kids to bed.She said there was a party at PR guru Matthew Freud’s house and I had to join her to canvas the room for donations. While she turned up looking — and smelling — ine I had to rush there straight from the kitchen, stinking of fish.But boy was it worth it — we raised £million. Oh, and let the records show that £, of that was raised by the girls — with the help of some very generous friends.As well as bringing money to a brilliant cause, it’s highly entertaining viewing. And this year is going to be top notch, with some amazing players.The girls’ team consists of Amanda Holden, Ayda Williams, Kelly Hoppen, Rachel Johnson and Tameka Empson. The boys’ team is Omid Djalili, Richard Arnold, Russell Kane, Rylan Clark-Neal and Sam Allardyce. Their task is a ­cabaret-themed event.Sam Allardyce, former England football boss, was also my football manager at West Ham for several years and he was very, shall we say, authoritarian. But during this process he had on a hairnet and was making canapes — and, ahem, wore a bright neon dress with panache.I can reveal Claude Littner had a much better time than me overseeing the girls’ team. They were unbelievably dynamic, organised and focused.Meanwhile, the boys were all ­wandering around saying, ‘Er, what do we do ’ Believe me, it took all my willpower to hold my tongue and not try to get them organised.While the girls struggled to hold their ticket price, the boys stood firm and Simon Cowell put huge pressure on Ayda and Amanda with a surprise demand for the girls.But at the end of the day, one major donation to either team means anyone can win, organised or not.There is a jaw-dropping moment when one of the boys “entertains” the audience with balloons strategically placed to hide his, ahem, “three-piece suite” as Lord Sugar puts it. And when the balloons pop . . . you won’t believe what you have just witnessed.After the task, back in the boardroom, Claude was full of enthusiasm about how fantastic the girls were and what a brilliant time he’d had.I said nothing. When Rylan askedI had anything to say, I said: “Plenty — and none of it good.”They would have done anything for the charity. And I mean anything. I could hardly watch at one point. It really is laugh-out-loud funny.Boy is this show going to be worth the ten-year wait.Celebrity Apprentice for Comic Relief is on BBC on March  and .ONLY Elle Macpherson could manage to look a million dollars while wearing cosy winter warmers.She arrived as a special guest at Vienna Opera Ball in Austria wearing a grey knitted polo neck and white, wide-leg trousers – yet somehow managing to look the very definition of effortless chic.I am particularly envious because although I know I can brush up well, when left to my own devices my look is either bag lady or corporate stf.NEW figures showing how dramatically domestic violence has risen in London are truly sickening. There was an appalling  per cent increase in offences between  and .The sheer quantity is horric – in  there were , domestic abuse crimes recorded by the Met Police, compared with , in .These figures are for London but – obviously – it’s happening all over the country.I can’t help thinking thatit was revealed that , MEN had been attacked, assaulted and hurt by the women in their lives, more would be done to stop it.But what I really want to know is: Why are so many men intent on hurting women The good news is that Sadiq Khan, London mayor, announced an extra £million of funding for support services for domestic violence victims, saying cuts had left them at “breaking point”.Also, Clare’s Law means people will be able to check whether their partners have been domestic abusers.The legislation was named after Clare Wood, who was murdered and set on fire by her partner, who she did not know had previously served a three-year prison sentence for harassing another woman.These changes are positive.But isn’t it terrible that either thing is needed in the first place  Any domestic abuse whatsoever is shocking, tragic – and unnecessary. And we need hardline action to make it illegal.That involves stronger sentencing and an absolute zero-tolerance approach, until anyone guilty of it becomes a social outcast.She wants the cash to fund specic projects chosen by us – with more oversight to make sure the money is not squandered.I’ve got an even better idea. How about we don’t spend ANY money on foreign aid – except emergency disaster relief – and use it instead to fund our own hospitals, schools, housing and mental heath care NINE men were jailed in Bradford this week for a total of  years for grooming and sexually abusing vulnerable teenagers.A harrowing impact statement from one victim was read in court saying she was “nothing but a toy to play with”, which is vile.I want to know when we’re going to stop reading about these gangs of men who prey on and abuse young girls, ruining their lives.What is needed is prevention. Action must be taken in the care system to protect vulnerable young people and in society so people can speak out when they suspect someone is being groomed.Sentences should be stfer to make people think twice – eventheir moral compass is skewed – for fear of the consequences.This story makes me despair, though. What has happened to our community values to stop us looking after those who need it most HERE is your one-minute Brexit update for the week.There will be three key votes in Parliament.The first is a vote on Theresa May’s deal – her agreed terms for leaving the EU. It’s a “yes or no” question.We can only assume the answer will be no . . . again.Then the second vote – to leave Europe with No Deal.This is another “yes or no”. That, too, will surely be a no.So, MPs don’t want to leave with Theresa May’s deal and they don’t want to leave with No Deal.Then there will be another vote on delaying Brexit while they work out the terms on which we DO leave.That one could run for years and years.Blimey!MY heart goes out to the mother whose daughter’s stillbirth left her terried she would lose her two healthy sons. It really is a tragedy.And it must be unbearable for her that the NHS Trust admitted negligence.If she had a child who needed expensive care as a result of NHS negligence, it would make sense to sue the trust. But asking for £million compensation when the sad truth is all the money in the world won’t bring back her baby is a blow to an NHS already on its knees.In fact, its financial woes may even have contributed to the lack of care that caused this tragedy in the first place.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Only a blank so blank that it screams.”But it was “two-dinners” Watson, before his dramatic weight loss, whose “curry house conspiracy” with Gordon Brown toppled triple election-winner Tony Blair.It was Watson who was forced to apologise after using Parliamentary privilege to smear dead Tory Leon Brittan with “evil” child sex slurs.And it is Watson who aims to wreck free speech by gagging the Press.Jew-baiting Marxist Jeremy Corbyn seems a saint by comparison.His bleak imagery will come as no surprise in Westminster, but it explains the tidal wave of ministers who walked out of her Cabinet in exasperation.To her shame, Amber Rudd and her fellow Ruddites lacked the courage to follow suit last week.

I know, I know. It really could go either way, that one, couldn’t it  You might end up looking as toned as Joe Wicks — or more like Piers Morgan with an industrial air compressor up his rear.Fortunately, ITV and its diet expert Michael Mosley had gathered “six famous guinea pigs” to gorge themselves stupid and settle this debate for good: Nadine, Hayley Tamaddon off Coronation Street, Peter Andre, Made In Cha’s Hugo Taylor, “Chaser” Shaun Wallace and Tessa Sanderson, who all brought their own degree of hype and range of medical quirks to the experiment.Hayley, for instance, has irritable bowel syndrome, while Hugo suffers from a debilitating strain of irritable personality syndrome and is prone to quoting the Dalai Lama or grandly announcing: “I’m trying to do this for other people. It’s kind of, like, a selfless act.” Or it was, until Hugo decided he couldn’t be arsed and pulled out of the experiment at the end of Week One.The other five kept eating, eating, eating, though, until their bodies began to groan, fart and generally give up on their owners. Hayley and Tessa both had to be withdrawn from the process on health grounds, Shaun Wallace developed sleep apnoea and Nadine began passing “rubber pellets”.One other thing also became apparent during the opening few days of The Junk Food Experiment. Their innards could’ve been begging for mercy and Nadine might well have been on the verge of crapping a cc song, but they all looked exactly the same.It was no sort of spectacle at all, so they tried perking it up with all sorts of production stunts. Peter Andre went for a brain scan that revealed it’s  per cent McFlurry, Michael Mosley entered a competitive eating challenge and Shaun Wallace was sent to his local pub quiz, where he misidentied “the unwanted, loud screeching sounds you sometimes hear from a microphone or speaker” as “white noise” rather than the correct answer, Little Mix.On Day , Nadine also went for another dump — and I don’t know what she was thinking while she sat there, but my mind was wandering to the fact it’s now  years since ITV axed World In Action, a show that was sold around the world and conducted the investigation leading to the release of the Birmingham Six.Here we are now, two decades later, watching six self-publicists come to the the “no-s***, Sherlock” conclusion of the century — eating nothing but pizzas and fast food is bad for you.With the most damning fact of all being that ITV, at the very least, is sending mixed messages about the obesity crisis on its network Hub, where I watched The Junk Food Experiment and every other show received the same promo message.“Sponsored by Domino’s — the official food of unmissable entertainment.”Thanks for your concern, though, ITV.

I mean who, in their imaginations, wants to eliminate the human race It is worth looking at some data. Many of the kids, led by Greta herself, argue that governments are “doing nothing” to reduce carbon emissions.  Not that they are failing to do enough – which is a legitimate argument – but that they are doing nothing.Yet figures published on Monday show an astounding decline in Britain’s CO₂ output. According to statistics released by Carbon Brief,  saw the sixth consecutive fall in the carbon pumped by Britain into the atmosphereTotal emissions are down by  per cent since , a record unmatched by any other major country. With the exception of , the year of the General Strike, you have to go back to  to find a lower level of carbon output.Given the rise in our population in the meantime, that figure is even more impressive. In per capita terms, we have now reduced CO₂ emissions to the level of .You can of course argue that there is still more to do. But “doing nothing”  Seriously  Yet that is indeed the claim being made by eco-activists. They are asserting that governments, including ours, are deliberately wasting time for some reason that no one ever quite explains, but that vaguely has to do with “putting profits before people”.Listen to the way in which the London marchers explained their behaviour in a video put out by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. One after another, the young people claimed that they were protesting against people who were quite happy to wreck Planet Earth.“The government doesn’t really care about our future,” said the first demonstrator. “They’re just trying to waste time,” said the second. “I really care about it, because it’s gonna be my kids who wake up and the world’s in pieces,” said the third. “We’re the ones who have to live here,” said the fourth.And where do you suppose the rest of us will be living  I mean, I get that it is tempting to demonise your opponents, but not wanting their own kids to survive  That’s not exactly setting the bar high, is it To be fair, most of us see the world in black-and-white when we’re in our teens. Think back to what you used to read or watch at that age. Young adult literature doesn’t really go in for shades of grey, does it  J.K Rowling doesn’t try to explain what makes the Malfoys nasty. Their nastiness is a given.Some youngsters extend their Harry Potter view of the world into politics, ing the world, not into Leftists and Rightists, but into goodies and baddies. Why would someone want to poison the seas or burn the rainforests  Because – weren’t you listening  – they’re baddies.Most of us eventually learn that le is more complicated than that. For example, Britain has seen huge reductions in its CO₂ emissions because, under Margaret Thatcher, it stopped subsidising unprofitable coalmines. At that time, the sort of people who now march against climate change were marching against the closures.The reason that the United Statesis also seeing a sharp fall in its carbon output is that it is has taken up large-scale fracking – again, a technology that many of the marchers hate.But rehearsing these arguments means acknowledging that things aren’t always simple. It means understanding that there is a trade-off between opportunities for deprived communities and carbon output. It means grasping that most carbon emissions come from China and India. It means recognising the contradiction between “mining coal good” and “burning coal bad”.Most of the marchers will come to understand these things. But some will carry on telling themselves that people who disagree with them are, like the Malfoys, just evil. A few will never grow out of their teen certainties at all.

Maria, , of Costa Rica, said: “There was a  with two crew members and they were mad with us. “We started yelling to them ‘please, please let us on the cruise is still here’. “But the guys said ‘you are not going to be so lucky and we are closing the doors and leaving’. “Alessandro was in shock because it was his nightmare and it actually happened.“He was so frustrated he wanted to jump to the ship. But [the drop] was so big and dangerous.”Maria, who is also a trained journalist, said she has never missed a train, plane or boat before, but because they were relaxing on their honeymoon they let their guard down. It was the ship’s last port before ing to Miami and it was the sixth day of a seven-day cruise.They claim the ship usually sailed at .pm from its stops, but this time the ship departed Nassau, in the Bahamas, two hours earlier than they expected.In an excruciating twist, they had arrived at the port just minutes before the ship was due to sail but didn’t realise it was about to set off.Maria said: “We thought we were on time. We were there .pm or .pm and we heard the call from the ship — but there were so many cruises we thought it was another ship. Then we heard the horn. When we arrived to the pier we were in shock.”Here they saw the gangway had been removed and the vessel was in the process of leaving its moorings.  Maria said: “I think the worst feeling was to see that the boat was still there and knowing we can go inside and see the boat leave without you. “I think I would have preferred to have been at the pier and the boat had already gone.”To make matters worse, the couple realised they had left their passport, visas, and credit cards on board, meaning they were marooned on the island with no money or way out.Fortunately the crew managed to retrieve their travel documents and cards on board before handing them to the pilot who was guiding the ship out of the harbour.He then immediately sailed back to the quayside and handed Maria and Alessandro their passports and wallets.But they were forced to pay £ each to fly back to Miami after the blunder and were reunited with their luggage three days later.At the immigration office they learned they were actually one of six people who missed the boat. Maria said: “There were two other couples. One were very, very angry so we didn’t keep in touch but the other two were nice.Shortly after they ed home the couple found out a video which captured their dockside debacle had gone viral — but they saw the humorous side to it.Maria said: “Of course it would be betterit didn’t happened. But it could have a positive flip-side. “Now I can say it was funny experience and we have a good story to tell our kids when we have kids.”The video of her holiday mishap was filmed from the deck of the nearby Norwegian Bliss and the call to depart came at .pm local time.Dockers began removing the gangway and closing the door with the ship leaving at .pm.The hapless couple showed up five minutes later with shopping bags from their excursion.Frantically waving, they tried to get the attention of people on the dock and on the ship.Other passengers on the cruise ship can be seen looking at the couple from their balconies as the propellers start to churn in the water.Maria is a household name in her home country and found fame as a  year old or the TV show Recreo Grande.The star — who is also a top model and social media star — is best known for the weekly show RG Elementos.In , she co-starred in the movie Buscando a Marcos Ramirezm a box office success in her home country."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000460243858.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle trolls royal family stupid arrogant report abusive  cops","story":"In one vile post believed to be referring to Meghan Markle, one user wrote: How dare the arrogant BRF [British Royal Family] threaten me, a US citizen, with possible policeI express disgust for that narcissistic skank Writing on the JerseyDeanne website, the New York user added: Will they deny me a visitor’s visa next!

Columba sent a man across the River Ness after stories of a “water beast” had circulated. It’s said that while the man was swimming he was approached by a beast but Columba made the sign of the cross and told the animal to “go no further”.George SpicerModern day interest in the beast was largely sparked by a sighting in July  by George Spicer and his we when they claimed a most extraordinary form of animal crossed the road in front of their car.Surgeon’s photographPerhaps the best-known picture of Nessie is the ‘Surgeon’s photograph’ which was published in April , supposedly showing the animals head and long neck. According to the photographer Robert Kenneth Wilson, he managed to capture the image while he was looking at the lake. The image though was exposed as a huge hoax in the  book, Nessie – the Surgeon’s Photograph Exposed.Holmes videoLab technician Gordon Holmes claimed he had managed to film the monster in  which he described as this jet black thing, about  metreslong, moving fairly fast in the water. Both BBC Scotland and STV aired the footage at the time which marine biologist Adrian Shine described as among “the best footage [he had] ever seen.”Nessie was reported to have been seen  times in .Research carried out last year revealed that the mythical creature is worth £m a year to the Scottish economy.Irish missionary St Columba is said to have been the first person to spot the beast in the River Ness in AD."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000473857723.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"mistress bdsm dog walk waterloo station","story":"The brief clip shows an elderly man on his knees in the middle of the central London train station while a woman holds onto a dog lead tied to his neck.In the clip the woman, dressed in leather, fishnet tights and black boots appears to speak to police who have stopped her.While the identity of the woman has not been confirmed, it is thought to be a dominatrix known as Miss Foxx who is selling the footage on an adult-only website which seems to have been filmed on February  at around pm.Miss Foxx wrote: “I decided to take my human b***h for a walk from Waterloo.“I have done public walks several times before but I did not expect this kind of reaction.”While out on her walk she claims she had other woman “asking questions, smiling, laughing” as well as passers-by asking to film her and her man-slave.She even claimed a priest had “the biggest smile on his face”.In the post she also says she was stopped by the police because she was “disturbing the peace”.The footage has now gone viral on social media and sites like Reddit where it has picked up around , comments.One joker on the site wrote: “Probably just tired waiting for a train at Waterloo station”.Another added: “I get being into that sort of thing, and I’m not judging anyone, but… whatsomeone he knows sees him ”A third commented: “There really is someone for everyone.”British Transport Police confirmed to The Sun Online they had attended an incident at the station on February  but added no action had been taken and there had been no reports of a crime having taken place.The man is pictured kneeling on the station with a dog lead attached"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000473874677.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"man finds girlfriends secret box used condom netflix you","story":"He claimed she hoarded personal items above her wardrobe including a toothbrush, boxer shorts, hair from his comb, toenail clippings and a used condom.The creepy discovery was compared to hit Netflix stalker drama You, in which the main character has a box of keepsakes he stole from a woman he tricks into falling love with him.Reddit user Ellamk appealed for help on the sites Relationship Advice thread yesterday in a post titled: My girlfriend has a creepy box above the wardrobe.The -year-old said his student lover, aged , appeared normal after a year together and until recently I have never noticed anything strange about her behaviour.But one day she left him in her room when she went to lectures and he started rummaging through her stuff out of boredom.On top of her wardrobe was an old Ted Baker box - and when I opened it I found so many random things that I used to own.He said: There were odd socks in there that she has taken.

The Tory welfare chief admitted disabled people feel put on trial by the benefit system in a damning verdict on her own party’s legacy. Unveiling a string of new policies, the Work and Pensions Secretary said the Department for Work and Pensionsmust go further, to listen harder and to reform effectively.” Ms Rudd drew on the experience of her late father, who was blind for more than  years, saying: “I want to believe I felt his anxiety, the struggles his blindness brought. Every stumble. Dignity and frailty “These weren’t intellectual exercises for me - they were visceral. I never pitied him, I empathised and I supported him. Ms Rudds comments mark a sharp break from David Cameron’s talk of the welfare scrounger in  and George Osborne’s complaint about people “sleeping off a le on benefits in .  Charities welcomed the package of measures but said Ms Rudd must go further. Mark Hodgkinson, Chief Executive of Scope, said: “Far more progress needs to be made before disabled people are truly equal. Disabled people will rightly say that these measures don’t go far enough.” So what has she actually announced  Heres a summary. . , disabled pensioners will no longer face regular reviews  More than , disabled pensioners will be spared cruel repeated tests to prove they deserve benefits. From this Spring, Personal Independence Paymentclaimants over the state pension age will no longer face unnecessary reviews every few years. Instead it is thought the claimants, of which there are currently around ,, will face “light touch” reviews of their condition once a decade. They can still have a reviewthey ask for one. The Tory welfare chief will also look to merge tests for two benefits, ESA and PIP, into one system, and could upgrade targets to help more disabled people into work. Charities welcomed the shake-up but demanded Ms Rudd go further - warning millions of others will still be stuck in a failing system.  Benefits outsourcing giant Maximus will have its contract for hated ‘fit-for-work’ tests extended by more than a year, ministers announced today. The corporate empires benefit testing firm will carry out ‘Work Capability Assessments’ for ESA payments for a further  months to July . The extension - the second since the contract began in  - will allow the firm to rake in tens of millions of pounds more taxpayers money from the tests. But ministers insist it is a temporary measure to ensure stability ahead of a huge shake-up...  Ms Rudd announced plans to merge the fit-for-work test - which assesses people for Employment and Support Allowance- with a separate test into one unied, integrated service from . Under the new scheme, to be piloted this year, fit-for-work tests would be combined with assessments for a dferent disability benefit, Personal Independence Payment . Ms Rudd argued it would pave the way for a more joined-up claimant experience in future. But charities warned it could just make things worse. Genevieve Edwards of the MS Society warned: “It’s like harnessing two donkeys to a farm cart and expecting it to transform into a race chariot. . Appeal victories are too high and the system will be looked at  The Work and Pensions Secretary said the Department for Work and Pensionsmust go further, to listen harder and to reform effectively. And she admitted the number of PIP disability benefit appeals ruling against the government - % last summer - was “too high” and of “particular concern.” Its a major change in tone after the DWP repeatedly emphasised that the proportion of appeal victories were low compared to cases overall. The Cabinet minister added: We should do more to gather the evidence we need to make the right decision, earlier, so fewer claimants have to seek redress through a tribunal. “I will be looking at this matter over the coming months.” . The sanctions regime could be softenedMs Rudd told MPs: My Department will be testing how we increase engagement and build a trusted and strong relationship between work coaches and claimants awaiting an assessment in Universal Credit , and those found to have Limited Capability for Work.Last month, in response to the Work and Pensions Select Committee report on benefitssanctions, the Department agreed to carry out a small test. [This is where] work coaches start from a point of no conditionality and scale up where appropriate, focusing on what claimants can do. This contrasts with the current approach, which starts at full conditionality and then tailors down accordingly. The Minister for Employment is taking this forward. . The internal appeal system could be reformed  Currently to launch a benefits appeal you must go through an internal DWP system called mandatory reconsideration first. Some claimants claim this system is a whitewash designed to put extra barriers in front of them. Fewer than a fth of MRs are successful for claimants. Ms Rudd said: We will also be exploring whether we can enhance the mandatory reconsideration process to gather further evidence from claimants and make more accurate decisions sooner. . Sick pay reforms are finally being brought forward Long-planned reforms to Statutory Sick Pay, touted for more than a year, will finally be consulted on shortly. Ms Rudd said: “When someone is too ill to work, the system that awaits them should provide the support they need without writing them off. “I’ve been working with the Health Secretary to look at how we can improve statutory sick pay and occupational health, to enable employers to provide comprehensive support. “We will shortly consult on reform of statutory sick pay and improving access to occupational health. “We want to encourage and support people to play their part in this agenda.” . Therell be new research designed to help claimants  Ms Rudd said: “I will commission a new piece of research to better understand claimants’ experiences of the benefit system and how to meet their needs. “This research will complement the report Scope published last week, which provides an important reminder of the extra costs faced by disabled people. “Together these will inform future policy-making to better reflect the needs of disabled claimants.” . A disability work target could be made more ambitious The target to see million more disabled people in work by  could be raised, Amber Rudd said.

Two separate tests will be merged into one unied, integrated service from , Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd announced. The tests are Work Capability Assessment for Employment and Support Allowanceor Universal Credit - run by a subsidiary firm of Maximus called Centre for Health and Disability Assessments Ltd - and separate assessments for Personal Independence Payments , run by Capita and an arm of Atos.  Todays extension comes despite more than two-thirds of appeal tribunalsoverturning fit-for-work tests last year. Yet confirming the contract extension, Ms Rudd argued it would pave the way for a more joined-up claimant experience in future. She added: “This will allow for a safe and stable service now, and as we transition to the new integrated service.” The announcement came ahead of a wide-ranging speech by Ms Rudd vowing to improve the disability benefit system after years of warnings it is throwing people into destitution. She admitted disabled people feel put on trial by the DWP process and “we need to do more to close the gap between intentions and reality. She said the enormous rate of appeals ruling against the government - % for PIP last summer - is of particular concern and the number is too high. And she signalled a major break from the language of the past, when ex-PM David Cameron talked of the welfare scrounger in  and ex-Chancellor George Osborne talked of the closed blinds of their next-door neighbour sleeping off a le on benefitsin .  She also announced, disabled PIP claimants will no longer be regularly re-assessed PIP and Universal Credit claimants could eventually receive a single assessment to “capture all the information required in one appointment” Ministers are “taking forward” moves to soften the benefit sanctions regime for some claimants Ministers are “exploring” whether to reform the internal appeal system, known as mandatory reconsideration, in a bid to make decisions more accurate A commitment to see million more disabled people in work in the decade to  could be made more ambitious Long-planned reforms to Statutory Sick Pay will finally be consulted on shortly A new piece of research will be run to better understand claimants’ experiences of the benefit system.This is only the start. We can, and should, go further, Ms Rudd said. But Marsha De Cordova, Shadow Minister for Disabled People, said Ms Rudd’s statement was “vague on detail and raises signicant questions” - and demanded an urgent Commons debate.  Maximus health assessments arm, Atos Independent Assessment Servicesand Capita have been paid hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayer cash for carrying out ESA and PIP assessments. Yet the majority of full appeals overturn the original decision - including in more than , tribunals for PIP since it launched in . Despite the figures, last year the Capita and Atos contracts for PIP tests were extended for the second time to July . Today Ms Rudd said Maximus contract would be extended in a way that aligned it to the duration of the PIP contracts. Maximus subsidiary firm Centre for Health and Disability Assessments Ltd previously had its contract - due to expire on  February  - extended to  February . She said in a written statement to MPs: I have established the Health Transformation Programme to undertake the signicant task of transitioning the currently separate Work Capability Assessmentfor Employment and Support Allowance and Universal Credit , and the PIP assessment services into one unied, integrated service from . To support this, we are developing a single digital . An integrated approach will allow for a more joined-up claimant experience across these benefits, which takes account of the multiple interactions an inidual may have with DWP. We hope that developing our own digital  will also enable a greater range of assessment providers to compete to help us deliver this important service in the future. To enable an integrated service, we are extending the contract for the Health and Disability Assessment Service , which includes the delivery of the WCA, and aligning it to the duration of the extended PIP contracts. This will allow for a safe and stable service now, and as we transition to the new integrated service. Charities last night welcomed reforms to the disability benefits system. But they urged Ms Rudd to go further - and warned combining two very dferent tests was an uphill challenge. Genevieve Edwards of the MS Society warned neither of the tests reflect the reality of MS and bringing them together won’t make things better. She added: It’s like harnessing two donkeys to a farm cart and expecting it to transform into a race chariot. Richard Kramer, Chief Executive of Sense, said:“We agree that the assessment processes need to be transformed and the Secretary of State is right to address this. However, the two benefits and their assessments are intrinsically dferent and therefore the question is, how combining the two will work in practice. We are worried that, rather than fixing a problem, there is a risk of simply compounding the problems that disabled people are already facing when it comes to the assessments. A spokesperson for Centre for Health and Disability Assessments said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with DWP to deliver the Health Assessment Advisory Service. Since taking over the service we have fundamentally improved the experience for those we assess. The time spent in the assessment process has more than halved, we have doubled the number of clinical staff working in the service and consistently met the majority of our performance targets. We will continue to work in partnership with charities and disabled people’s organisations to improve the service further.” Asked about the extension today by the Mirror, Ms Rudd said: We have the contractors in place for the next few years. I hope the changes that we are making will make it more competitive going forward.” "},{"url":null,"title":"margaret hodge accuses jeremy corbyn","story":"NewsMargaret Hodge accuses Jeremy Corbyn of deliberately misleading her over anti-SemitismThe Jewish MP has been critical of the labour leaders handling of anti-SemitismShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical CorrespondentDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video dame-margaret-hodge-slams-corbyn-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIMargaret Hodge has accused Jeremy Corbyn of misleading her over handling of anti-Semitism cases. The Labour MP says she was told by Mr Corbyn when they met last week that his office had no role in the handling of disciplinary cases. However after a number of emails were leaked and a whistleblower spoke to the Observer, she wrote to to Mr Corbyn expressing concern that either the leader had intentionally misled her or his staff are misleading him. Dame Margaret wrote: I was given categorical assurances that this does not happen and has never happened. However, it is clear from the whistleblowers account that your staff did intervene and have had a direct role in complaints. Labour have insisted that it was categorically untrue to suggest that staff in the leaders office overturned recommendations in cases.But emails leaked to the Times appear to confirm that senior officials in the leaders office did become involved in inidual complaints. Dame Margaret added: This directly contradicts what I was told at our meeting and shows that the measures put in place to tackle antisemitism are neither independent nor robust. In fact, they were subject to political interference from a senior member of your own office. I can only conclude that either you have intentionally misled me or your staff have been misleading you. Earlier today Dame Margaret accused Mr Corbyn of promising a zero tolerance approach that fell apartthe cases involved his mates. And she condemned the appointment of Tony Blairs ex-flatmate Lord Falconer as anti-Semitism surveillance commissioner - saying the peer is not independent.  Last summer, when action was being taken by the Labour Party against me, I was absolutely bombarded by telephone calls from Charlie Falconer, the Jewish MP revealed to the BBC. They were not about the rights and wrongs of the case. They were all about trying to force me to give an apology.It comes as Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson is set to hold private talks with Jeremy Corbyn today over the anti-Semitism crisis. We need somebody totally outside the Labour Party otherwise this becomes another Chakrabarti fiasco, she said. Dame Margaret complained only  people have been expelled over anti-Semitism, although dozens more quit before disciplinary action concluded. Last summer Dame Margaret clashed with Jeremy Corbyn, branding him an anti-Semite and a racist to his face in the House of Commons. She initially faced disciplinary action but it was later dropped.  Margaret Hodges letter in full HOUSE OF COMMONS LONDON SWA OAA Rt Hon Jeremy Corbyn MP House of Commons London SWA OAA th March  Dear Jeremy, Thank you for meeting me last week to discuss the steps that are being taken to tackle antisemitism in the Labour Party and for setting out how complaints are handled. You made it clear in our discussion that your office plays no part in the complaints process, which is handled exclusively by the General Secretary and her staff. You will therefore not be surprised that I was somewhat bewildered when I read the whistleblowers account in the Observer that contradicts what you told me to my face last week. It is simply unacceptable for a senior member of staff in your office to intervene in the disciplinary process to prevent a party member from being suspended for antisemitism. In doing this, your office overturned a recommendation made by staff in the partys complaints unit. As you will recall, you assured me last week that neither you nor anyone in your office are involved or are aware of such complaints. I distinctly remember it being said that it would be appallingstaff in the Leaders office intervened or had a role in complaints. I was given categorical assurances that this does not happen and has never happened. However, it is clear from the whistleblowers account that your staff did intervene and have had a direct role in complaints.   This directly contradicts what I was told at our meeting and shows that the measures put in place to tackle antisemitism are neither independent nor robust. In fact, they were subject to political interference from a senior member of your own office. I can only conclude that either you have intentionally misled me or your staff have been misleading you. I look forward to hearing from you to explain which one is the case. Finally we also discussed your proposed appointment of Charlie Falconer as an independent reviewer. I explained to you in detail at our meeting why, because of his behaviour last summer, I think his appointment would be inappropriate. I am disappointed that you appear to be going ahead and appointing him anyway. I do not have trust in his independence in this role. It is symptomatic of the problems we face that I must write to you within days of our meeting. This undermines any confidence I and others have that you really want to build trust on this issue.

The money is needed to plug the gap left by years of underfunding from the government. One example, uncovered by a Times investigation, was of a state school asking parents to give pound, per child each year. Others do not specy amounts but are receiving pound, a year. A growing number of schools told the newspaper they are adopting a four and a half day week to save money, with one saying it would charge parents for their children to stay in school on Friday afternoons. And today the Labour MP Jess Phillips tweeted a picture of a letter sent from her sons schools telling parents they were planning to shut at pm on Fridays from Sepetember.It explained: This measure will mean that we can make savings by reducing the number of teachers employed by the school and reducing hours worked by support staff.They told parents that they were looking into providing paid childcare during those hours.The government insist that school funding is at its highest ever level reaching pound.bn by . But according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies between - and - school spending per pupil in England fell by about % because of a rise in pupil numbers and cuts to councils and sixth forms. While the overall amount does not take into account inflation or per-pupil funding. About  schools responded to Freedom of Information Act requests from the Times, of which more than  said they had asked for parental donations in the past year. About half asked for specic amounts.   Jeremy Corbyn tweeted about the figures, saying: Austerity is a political choice, not an economic necessity. And a generation are paying the price. The highest request, for pound, a year per family, came from Rosh Pinah, a Jewish primary school in north London. The donations contribute to the running costs of the school, the curriculum, security and Jewish studies. Sir Thomas Richs, a grammar school in Gloucester, said it received donations of pound, last year. It asks alumni and parents and said that it aimed to raise pound, in the last academic year. Henrietta Barnett, a grammar in north London, said: All costs above the basics are passed on to parents as voluntary contributions. Only essential maintenance is done, school buildings are falling into disrepair. We will have to use our reservesin order to survive. A Department for Education spokesman said: We have protected the core schools budget overall in real terms since , and put an additional pound. billion into core schools funding across - and -, over and above plans set out at the last spending review. We recognise the budgeting challenges schools face and that we are asking them to do more. Thats why we have introduced a wide range of practical support to help schools and head teachers, and their local authorities, make the most of every pound.

The grandmother said the scaffolding had been left outside the building since the workers complained of not being paid and stopped coming to work.  Instead of waiting for the workers to come and finish the work, she decided to take action and climbed out of her first-floor window and hauled away the planks obstructing her view, , reports Devon Live.I leaned out of the window and pushed one of the planks and I was able to move it as it wasnt screwed down and so I pushed it down the passage way, she said.

The toddler was about to be transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit when she suffered a cardiac arrest. Doctors tried to resuscitate Marcie, who lived with her family in Bath, but were unable to save her. Avon Coroners Court heard Marcie died shortly before am on December   having been taken to the hospitals emergency department by her father James Tadman two days previously. The inquest heard she had been suffering with a cough for a couple of weeks and her father had telephoned the out of hours GP service on the morning of December , who said she should see one of the doctors. Marcie was examined and I was told she had a viral infection, Mr Tadman said. I was told to keep doing what I was doing and to keep her well hydrated and feed her and to keep up with the Calpol and she should improve in  hours but she would get worse before she got better.  That night Marcie was regularly coughing as she slept and at .am Mr Tadman got up to check on her. He took her the hospital because he was concerned about her breathing. A male nurse told me she was suffering from a simple chest infection, possible pneumonia, and that antibiotics would be given and she would be right as rain, he said. She was taken to the childrens ward and given the antibiotics, and Mr Tadman was told his daughter would be able to go home in a couple of days. Mr Tadmans sister, Rachael Le Huray, went to visit her niece on the evening of December  and noticed the alarms on Marcies monitors kept going off. Before I left one of the last things James said to me was dont worry shell be fine, she said. I stroked her hair and said goodbye. That was the last time I saw her alive. She was dead eight hours later. Mr Tadman said he shared his sisters concerns and questioned whether his daughter was getting sicker but was reassured the antibiotics would help. He said he fell asleep and woke at am on December  to find Marcie had been sick again. I was starting to get concerned because Marcie was still talking to me and was generally responsive but she looked worse and very unwell, he said. No-one  seemed concerned so that put me at ease.  A consultant then entered the room and ordered her transfer to the intensive care unit. I explained to Marcie that everything was OK and they were going to go to another room, he said. She looked at me and said OK, daddy. When the nurse finished giving the fluids Marcie looked at me, took one big breath and she looked straight into my eyes. I had hold of her other hand and was stroking it, telling her she was going to be OK, she just seemed to turn off when she exhaled and went limp. I really didnt know what was going on. I looked at the nurse and she had a look of horror on her face and shouted crash. I couldnt believe this was happening. He added: They were attempting resuscitation and that hour and a half was most definitely the worst of my le.  A doctor then came to see him to tell him they were going to stop resuscitation. It was all a bit of blur, I just couldnt get my head around how we had got to this point when they had been telling me all day she was going to be fine, he said. They couldnt explain why there had been so little concern and why we had received so much reassurance and then she had died. A post-mortem examination found Marcie had died from a Group A Streptococcus infection with secondary pneumonia. Dr Victoria Jacobs, who had examined Marcie at the out of hours GP service, told the court her notes of the appointment could have been better and she has since hugely reflected upon this. A doctor who examined Marcie shortly after she was admitted to hospital told an inquest she did not screen Marcie for sepsis. Dr Claire Verey who worked in the emergency department at Baths Royal United Hospital at the time said she did not use a sepsis screening tool. Wiping away tears, she told an inquest Avon Coroners Court in Bristol: My diagnosis was based purely on the Marcie I saw in front of me. In my mind, Marcie Tadman was definitely an unwell child in front of me. I reconciled all the observations I had in front of me with bacterial pneumonia. This is my only explanation for not doing all the sepsis tests. I cannot fully explain why sepsis didnt pop up in my head. Its just I genuinely felt that all the signs pointed to pneumonia. Rather than using the screening tool I used my own judgement looking at Marcie as she was in front of me. I apologise wholeheartedly for what happened to Marcie. Dr Verey told the inquest that, had Marcie been screened for sepsis, she should have been given IV antibiotics sooner, as sepsis guidelines dictate. She said: It can be very dficult to decide whether or not someone has sepsis. Sepsis is still quite rare in children. Putting a drip into an adult is a relatively easy thing to do, but getting a drip into a child is not so straightforward. I know that thought crossed my mind at the time, and meant that I maybe didnt get a drip in to start giving antibiotics perhaps as quickly as the sepsis guidelines dictated. She added: The sepsis screening tool is designed to be quite a blunt tool, and it will pick up a lot of children who are far less ill than Marcie was and who maybe dont need the full screening. Therefore rather than using the tool I used my judgement looking at Marcie as she was in front of me, and maybe thats why she didnt get the treatment. The inquest continues.

Nicola Bentley, , and husband Phil, , say that they complained about the issues ten months ago. However they claim that only  per cent of the problems at their home in Kippax near Leeds have been fixed. The pair used their le savings to help buy their four-bedroom dream-home, off plan from house-builders Persimmon after going to see a stunning show home. However after a few days of moving into the detached home, they discovered a number of problems. This included doors that did not fit properly and holes in the plasterwork. Architraves were also found to be uneven, there was cracking around the window boards, bubbled paintwork and even the turf in their garden was lumpy and uneven.   The married couple, who have two children aged  and , say the home was left looking like a building site. They noticed problems as soon as they got the keys last May and it has been an uphill struggle ever since. Financial director Nicola suffers from systemic autoimmune disease lupus and claims increase stress levels and airborne dust have led to recent flare-ups. But despite contacting Persimmon Homes on a weekly basis the couple claim only % of the defects identied have actually been repaired. Mother-of-two Nicola said: Its been awful and its taken over our lives. There isnt one room in the whole house which is complete.  We are living in a building site, we havent been able to put any photos up on the walls and there is just a TV and sofa in the living room. We dont like to wallow in self-pity but this has dragged us down so much, it has nearly broken us as a family. Its been horrendous and the worst year of our lives. We wish we had never done it. This is our le savings, we have put everything into the house. I thought we had a dream home but its turned into a nightmare from hell. They keep apologising but apologies arent good enough. I just want our house finished and I want it right.   The couple outgrew their previous home of  years and decided to look for a bigger property. Nicola and Phil viewed a showroom home in September  which was of a similar style to the prospective house they were looking to move into to. After discussions, they decided to go-ahead with purchasing the new-build which was bought off-plan.  However, they were allegedly not allowed to inspect the property to make a snagging list prior to the exchange of contracts because it was against Persimmon policy. Dalek Graphics managing director Phil said: To start with, the Monday after we moved in we received a snagging report saying there were  defects. I identied a further . We were not allowed to inspect the house before we bought it. They said it was against Persimmon Homes policy to let us in before we signed on the dotted line.   We spoke to the solicitor about pulling out but we were advised it would cost up to pound,. They saidwe didnt move in when they said it would cost pound a day in penalty fees. We bought the house off plan. We liked the area and looked at a showroom house in a dferent development in Castleford in September  which was of a similar style.  The first thing I noticed when they gave us a new home demonstration was they had put the wrong size casings on every door, it was about an inch too big. They could not wait to give us the keys. I feel like Ive been robbed blind. We have spent pound, and then pound, in extras. Persimmon, the housebuilder which is at risk of seeing its lucrative Help to Buy contract removed, saw pre-tax profits surpass poundbillion last year. Pre-tax profits rose  per cent to pound.billion in , on a four per cent rise in revenues to pound.billion, it has been reported.   The profit rise comes after it built , new homes in the year, an increase of  compared to . It sold them for an average price of pound, - one per cent higher than in . Of these, nearly half, or ,, were sold to people using the Help to Buy scheme - some  more compared to . The housebuilder is reportedly at risk of being stripped of its right to participate in the Governments Help to Buy mortgage scheme.  Thats allegedly because of issues including the use of Help to Buy to acquire houses with leases, the quality of Persimmon homes and treatment of customers, and its leadership in the wake of the backlash over pay. The FTSE  company also recently confirmed that interim chief executive Dave Jenkinson will stay on in the role permanently after previous boss Jeff Fairburn was forced out at the end of last year following an outcry over his poundmillion bonus.

Imam Sis is slowly starving to death and his previously muscular physique is being eaten from within. And as the -year-old is now approaching three months without any food, his kidneys are also starting to struggle. And while the Newport man remains strong in spirit, he is becoming increasingly exhausted after a few minutes of conversation. He also stopped passing faeces  days ago, reports Wales Online. Since December  he has been on hunger strike, living on vitamin B and B tablets, and one fresh lemonade a day, supplemented with herbal teas and salty water. He came to the UK from Turkey  years ago as a political refugee and has lived in Wales for the last five years.   He said: The last couple of days I have hardly drank any liquid, it kills you and you get very bad headaches.I feel very tired even when I speak.Imams hunger strike is part of a global movement which has seen over  Kurds on hunger strike. The strikers are calling on the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture– a body responsible for investigating torture and human rights abuses in prisons – and the European Court of Human Rightsto investigate the alleged human rights abuses against a Kurdish leader.  Since  the leader of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party , Abdullah Oumlcalan, has been incarcerated in Turkey. Members of the Kurdish community in Wales say Oumlcalan has been in solitary confinement since  and he hasnt been allowed any visitors, family, or legal representation since September .

We love le, we love a free le but Kurdish people have no free le in the world. The  million have no freedom in the system. We are trying to change this.  I don’t want to do this hunger strike. All the hunger strikers take B complex vitamins. This is not a death fast. We don’t want to die. I have already lost over kilos. That is over three stone. Your heart rate gets funny.

Midwives detected that something was amiss when Carla Woods, , was giving birth to her youngest daughter, Freya, now  months old.She was diagnosed with cervical cancer after a lump was found on her vaginal wall, despite having no other symptoms. Now the mum-of-two from Caerphilly, Wales believes that her daughter has saved her le. After Carlas cervical cancer spread to two lymph nodes in her groin, she needed intense chemotherapy, radiotherapy and Brachytherapy to survive. Thankfully she was told in January this year shes now cancer free and is sharing her story to highlight the importance of smear tests. Carla said: I had no idea there was anything wrong until the midwives told me there was a mass on my vaginal wall.   I call Freya our little miracle baby as without her I wouldnt have been diagnosed with cancer until it had spread further. I never missed a smear test, I had one six months after my eldest daughter, Paige, four, was born but I was due my next one when I was pregnant with Freya which stopped me from having it done. At first the midwe thought it was a fibroid when she spotted the mass and they told me to book a doctors appointment for further tests.  I was so busy being a new mum to Freya that it took me a few weeks before I finally visited my doctor and was referred. It was such a shock for me and my husband, Andrew, , when I was finally diagnosed in June , we had no idea it would be something as serious as cancer. The tumour was already the size of a satsuma and I needed chemotherapy and radiotherapy to get rid of it. I also had a three week course of internal radiotherapy called Brachytherapy.   It wasnt how Id expected to spend my maternity leave but I was grateful to have caught it early so there was treatment available. Carla - a healthcare advisor - had never missed a cervical smear test before falling pregnant. Despite always having clear results prior to her diagnosis, she is now urging other women to not push aside the lesaving test. She added: I didnt have any of the usual symptoms that I are typical of cervical cancer for example, bleeding or back or pelvic pain. SoId not have been giving birth the tumour would have continued to grow which is why Im so thankful to Freya.   After being given the all clear at the start of this year as there was no evidence of cancer we are now trying to move on. People think theyre invincible but it can happen to anyone which is why smear tests are so important. Smear tests help detect cancer even when theres no symptoms at all.  I have been left infertile by the cancer treatment as it has caused my body to be in early menopause but Im so happy to now be cancer free. I cant thank the staff at the Velindre Cancer Centre, Cardf, for all their support during and after treatment as well as my friends and family. Im now sharing my story as a warning to other women and raise awareness for cervical cancer.

The a-like behaviour all began when the male passenger discovered there were no gluten free or meat-free meals.According to Canada’s CTV , he told crew that he could not eat meat or wheat.  One of his fellow passengers witnessed the escalating commotion and told the news site that while he didnt appear intoxicated, he was being rude to staff on board the flight from Vancouver to Toronto.

But instead a newlywed TV star and her husband arrived minutes late to watch their cruise ship sail off toward the horizon - without them. Even worse, the Royal Caribbean ship was carrying Costan Rican actress Maria Gonzalez Roesch and her new husband Alessandro di Palmas passports, money and clothes. Footage of the couples desperate dash in vain to board the ship and dawning realisation they had been marooned whipped around the world , and now the unlucky travellers have shared their nightmare story - revealing how they made it home.   The pair were on the sixth day of their seven-day Royal Caribbean cruise holiday on February  when the Symphony of the Seas ship was docked at Nassau port, before it was due toto Miami, Florida. Passengers had been given an all-aboard time of .pm and at .pm, the gangway was removed and doors were closed. The couple arrived five minutes too late. The video, taken from the Norwegian Bliss cruise liner docked next to the Royal Caribbean, shows them arrive, run toward the stern and attempt to speak to crew onboard, who cant be heard in the footage, but were likely giving them the bad news that it was too late.   The clip shows the pair waving their arms and screams of “no!” can be heard from as the ship moves away without its desperate cargo. Alessandro can be seen throwing up his hands in apparent defeat as the ships propellers start turning and the vessel moves away. Punctuating their dismay, the ship sounds its departure horn in a farewell to the port just minutes later. Maria, , last week explained on her Instagram that the cruise on the trip had always left at .pm but that day the ship left earlier.   The couple had been given a new itinerary but didnt read it, and had assumed the vessel would be departing on the same schedule as it had at other ports throughout their journey. The newlywed also claimed the couple were not the only ones to have made the mistake, saying they later learned they were among six people who had missed the boat. Speaking to the Sun on Tuesday, Maria explained the ships two crew-members they could be seen pleading with in the clip were mad with the couple.  We started yelling to them please, please let us on the cruise is still here. But the guys said you are not going to be so lucky and we are closing the doors and leaving, she said. Alessandro was in shock because it was his nightmare and it actually happened. He was so frustrated he wanted to jump to the ship. But [the drop] was so big and dangerous. The couple realised they had left their passports, visas and credit cards aboard, leaving them facing being stuck in Nassau with no means of getting home. I think the worst feeling was to see that the boat was still there and knowing we can go inside and see the boat leave without you, Maria told the Sun.   They were saved from being marooned on the island by a quick-thinking crew who sent the pilot guiding the ship out of harbour sailing back to the quayside with the couples travel documents and wallets. However their mistake cost them pound each for flights back to Miami, and it was three days before they got their luggage back, Maria saod. After the clip of their plight went viral, Maria, a model and social media star who became famous in her home country of Costa Rica as a child star on TV show Recreo Grande and is best known for the weekly show RG Elementos, said she could see the bright side. She reportedly said: “Now I can say it was funny experience and we have a good story to tell our kids when we have kids.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man discovers grandad using vagina","story":"NewsMan discovers grandad using vagina sex toy as vase next to late grans pictureThe mans innocent grandfather put a bunch of flowers in the the articial vagina - and no one had the heart to tell him what it was really meant forShareCommentsBySimon Glover:,  MAR NewsA promotion poster for Tenga Premium Vacuum Cups, released in , shows them with flowers inside \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was horried to discover his grandad using a vagina sex toy as a vase for his late nans flowers.

The grandson was visiting the family home, in Japan, when he went to the altar to pay his respects. But he quickly noticed something was not quite right. His grandfather had put flowers inside the young mans Tenga brand masturbation aid - alongside his late wes photo.  The confused pensioner had mixed up the red and white sex aid with a flower vase and included it as part of the altar display. The grandson said: My grandmother passed away a year ago, so I wanted to say a prayer for her, and I saw that the Tenga I received as a going-away present when I quit my old job is being used in the worst way anyone has ever used it. Grandpa... thats not a flower vase. Why didnt any of my relatives stop him before this happened  The only silver lining is that I hadnt ever used it.

The woman was one of  people arrested among six unmarried couples caught during a raid on a local hotel late last year, the The Sun reported . She is among at least two women who appeared unable to walk following their painful punishment on March , which took place in front of a mosque. Sharia police marched the  to a public square outside a mosque where they were caned as punishment for having a sexual relationship outside of marriage.  Awaiting them was a Sharia enforcer shrouded head to toe, except for a narrow slit in his robes. The province is known for enforcing Islamic criminal codes, despite secular laws applying in most of the rest of Indonesia, a Muslim-majority country where most practice the faith moderately.  But in Aceh, alcohol is banned, and adultery, sex outside marriage and homosexual acts are among the crimes outlawed. Punishments can include caning and whipping and imprisonment for those who break the strict laws, including travellers who fall foul of the rules.  The province has been criticised by human rights watchdogs including Amnesty International, which last year condemned the canings. The group saod some of those flogged included unmarried couples punished for showing affection in public. Two men were last year whipped with canes  times each after being caught having sex with underage girls. One begged for mercy as he received the lashes.  Indonesias President Joko Widodo has called for the public humiliations to stop. At one point Acehs Governor asked the capitals administration to bring the floggings indoors, to prevent investors being put off bringing their business to the region. Hundreds have been punished since the rule was introduced in the area in .  However the footage shows the canings in public spaces continue and remain popular, drawing plenty of appreciative spectators to film and photograph the events. Earlier this year a teen couple were flogged in Banda Aceh for cuddling in public. An audience gathered to watch and jeer as they were punished for being found guilty of the moral crime under Sharia law. The head of the local public order agency, Marwan, explained of this weeks spectacle: This law is designed to have a deterrent effect, not only for the offenders but for the spectators who watch the caning, the Sun reported.  He added: “The pain of being flogged is not that bad, the embarrassment is worse.” However the footage showed appeared to show otherwise, as the woman was pictured crying and hunched over in agony as she left the public square. Sharia courts also consider lesbian, gay and bisexual relationships a crime punishable with public canings, jail-time or fines. Wearing tight clothing or missing Friday prayers can also attract punishment. Unmarried couples are not allowed to sit together at the same table in public under the strict rules.

Myself and a mate were looking for somewhere to watch the tennis and, by chance, we met up with Pat and a few other United fans,” he said. “We had a good bit of banter and we’ve kept in touch since.”The friendship with Pat and other United fans actually led to the formation of a unique supporters’ club, the BeeArabs, so when Steve was planning his latest charity bike ride, this seemed an obvious route to take.“We thought it would be a good idea to start at Tannadice and head for Grfin Park.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

He was a former member of shinty#s South of Scotland area executive council and did a lot of work for the Referees’ Association.He was probably best known for his work with young players in Mid Argyll, organising qualying tournaments of the Aviemore Indoor Sixes tournament for many years. His work for that competition was recognised by the organisers when he was given a special award at Aviemore along with his friend Donnie MacKenzie of Lochaber.John helped reform Kilmory shinty club in the mid s along with Ian MacPhee, the late Kenny MacRae, Roddy Munro and Alex Campbell. He also served on their committee for many years.John had served as a policeman for a short time before working in the quarry at Furnace, then going on to be a very well-known driver with Gleaner Oils, which supported many of his shinty activities with young players in Argyll.John was a great organiser and acted as goal judge in a number of senior shinty finals including the Glasgow Celtic Society Cup and notably the Camanachd Cup Final in Inverness when Gordon MacIntyre of Oban Camanachd scored his famous winner at the Bught Park.John apparently retrieved the ball from the net and lobbed another onto the park for the re-start before presenting the goal-scoring ball to Gordon after the match.John is survived by his brother Jim who played for Glasgow Police and he was pre-deceased by his we Donella. As a couple they were permanent fixtures at most shinty events in Argyll and well beyond, particularly at events involving young players.Tribute reproduced courtesy of the Camanachd Association"},{"url":null,"title":"casa crew takes the plunge","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTo raise money for to make Heal Scotland a reality, Lilia Sinclair is encouraging everyone to join her to e into Loch Fyne.A dook is scheduled for Saturday March  # with a twist.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"drongan man 28 snared having","story":"NewsDrongan man, , snared for having sexual relations with -year-old girlSick Samuel Davidson, of Watson Terrace in Drongan, was caught out when officers found the teen in his bedroom on May , .ShareByAbi Smillie:,  MAR NewsDavidson admitted engaging in sexual activity with the girl\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA -year-old man was snared for having sexual relations with a -year-old girl after her parents filed a missing persons report.

The Royal National Leboat InstitutionAyr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat. The branch, which has been around for over  years, issued an urgent appeal last November, appealing for a younger generation to pitch in to save the Ayr branch . Committee member and Secretary Robin White, said: “Sadly the number of volunteers helping to run the branch recently has been dwindling, to such an extent that so few are left the AGM came to the sad decision to close the branch down. However, a number of branch members have indicated they still wish to support the RNLI and will now do so via the Troon Branch. “This Branch is looking for new volunteers, soyou would like to help, please get in touch.” Ayr once had its own Leboat, stationed at Ayr Harbour in  under the management of Ayr Harbour Trust.   During the following  years a number of dferent Leboats were in service, one of which was built in Shadwell, London in  for just under pound. This was transported from London to Ayr Station by rail free of charge, by the London and North Western Railway Company. It was taken down Ayr High Street to Ayr Harbour and christened the ‘Janet Hoyle’, after the donor’s we. Eventually in  the RNLI Committee of Management decided to close the station as Troon had a motor Leboat where there was deemed a safer harbour entrance.

Little Saul Wylie will travel to America for le-changing treatment on his severe form of cerebral palsy. The six-year-old, who weighed just lb at birth, has made the waiting list for pioneering surgery. There has been a massive charity effort across Ayrshire to fund the trip, with pound, raised in little over six months.Mum Karen, , told the Ayrshire Post : “To achieve this so quickly is beyond our wildest dreams.“We set a target of two years to get the money but the community reaction has been incredible.” Saul, of Tarbolton, has to go to the States because his aggressive condition is not treated on the NHS. The brave kid lives with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, which affects his muscle tone and leaves him unable to walk unaided. Karen said: “Saul’s dream is to be able to stand by himself and take independent steps and maybe even one day walk around school with his friends. “Like every parent, we long for endless opportunities for our boy. “Saul is very happy and determined but we just want him to have the best opportunity at a better quality of le and to become as independent as possible.”  Medication, Botox, and even trampoline therapy have all been used to try and limit Saul’s pain. But his spot at St Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri could be the ultimate answer. Karen said: “The operation is called selective dorsal rhizotomy, which will reduce Saul’s muscle stfness. “Added to intensive rehab, it will allow Saul to stand independently and potentially walk again. Unfortunately there is a waiting list for international patients so Saul’s surgery is not scheduled until . “But because we are in a position to go we have been put on their cancellation list and are keeping our fingers crossed.” Karen and husband Stuart have thrown themselves into a string of fundraising events with the ‘Steps For Saul’ campaign gathering momentum. Karen said: “We’ve done everything from coffee mornings to quiz nights and we can’t thank people enough for their response. “There have been skyes, race nights, sponsored cycles and I also did the Great Scottish Run. “People have taken Saul to their hearts and we’ve even had donations from as far afield as America, New Zealand, Canada and Ireland. “Hopefully he now has the chance he deserves.” • An open ice skate for Saul will take place at Ayr Ice Rink on Sunday, April , from -pm.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnDrugsCerebral palsyCharityAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14087197.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/0_SWNS_CAUL_BIRTH_02.jpg","title":"hmv re opens three scottish","story":"NewsHMV re-opens three Scottish stores after successful negotiations with landlordsThe companys managing director confirmed the move was \"the best outcome for our staff and customers\".ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsGeneral view of HMV at Ayr Central\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMusic giant HMV has re-opened its shop in Ayr Central shopping centre.

Blackburn, head of restructuring accountants French Duncan LLP, revealed the Hourstons site in Alloway Street, Ayr, was “unlikely to remain a retail” store. She said: “Hourstons battled against the changing retail environment but this is a story being told on the High Streets of many of our town and city centres as a lot of traditional retailers close because of major consumer changes. Councils need to look at ways to assist retailers, casual dining outlets and other stalwarts of the High Street to ensure that city centres remain attractive to consumers in the years to come. However, punitive business taxes and an inflexible approach by landlordsare leading to retail deserts in the heart of our communities.

Sleazy retired architect Ross McKay will also be kept under court supervision for the same period. McKay, , insisted he was innocent of the sordid behaviour but he was found guilty after a trial last month. Sherf John Montgomery told McKay: “You have been convicted of conduct which, in my estimation, contains a substantial sexual element and a signicant sexual aspect by clandestinely taking photos of female schoolgirls wearing short skirts. “At  years of age you really should be able to control yourself more appropriately than you have done by indulging in this sort of behaviour.” Sherf Montgomery warned McKay: “I detect an air of defiance from you, both at your trial and in what you have told the author of your criminal justice social work report. “My advice to you is keep a low profile. Do not put yourself in a position where it can be construed you have the aim of self-gratication.” Defence lawyer Gillian McBlane successfully argued against the imposition of a stringent sex offender prevention order against her client. This was requested by depute fiscal Vicky McMillan, and would have kept McKay out of public parks and well away from schools.   Ms McBlane said: “He is first offender and there is little to suggest he presents a signicant risk to the public.” Sherf Montgomery reminded her: “He continues to deny responsiblility.” But Ms McBlane maintained: “He very much recognises the authority of the court and he has assured me of his commitment to any order you might impose.” McKay, of Ardlochan Terrace in Maidens, insisted at his trial that he had not taken the photos of Belmont Academy schoolgirls in mini skirts that were found on his phone. He also denied stopping his car in Peggieshill Road to take the images, although the court heard evidence of a vehicle with the same registration as McKay’s parked there. The offences took place in mid- and again in March . Sherf Montgomery told McKay at the trial: “There is overwhelming evidence it was you in your car. “You’re guilty all day long.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSex crimeAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire school teacher accused","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire school teacher accused of sex with underage girlComputer science specialist Ryan Fisher appeared in the dock last week to deny any involvement.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  MAR NewsFisher was a teacher at Prestwick Academy when the sex is alleged to have taken place. \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA teacher is facing charges of having sex with an underage schoolgirl.

and a foot-tapping reminder of the swinging sexism of the late s.For anyone who enjoys those wonderful kitchen-sink dramas of the decade - A Taste of Honey, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, or Poor Cow - this is for you.Although, in fairness, at times it feels more Sid James than Shelagh Delaney as the humour and slapstick of Carry On provide plenty of laughs.And for anyone, like myself, who doesnt already know Made in Dagenham the Musical, dont despair... the songs, like the early Ford Cortinas, are instantly adorable.Kirsty Cleland has all the allure of a young Rita Tushingham as she enchants, enthrals and entertains in the lead role.As a strike-leader and long-suffering we, the Galashiels actress is both convincing and commanding.And the ever-reliable Stuart Mitchell, who plays hard-done-by husband Eddie, has to be at the top of his game not to be outshone.But, in true socialist fashion, Made in Dagenham the Musical isnt just about the leads... everyone has their part to play - and how well they play it.Tracy Borthwick is having a blast as the potty-mouthed Beryl.And Amanda Blacklock is pitch perfect as the hapless Clare who attempts to keep up with the flow of double-entendres.Ellen McFadzen, with her Viv Nicholson hair-style and shortening mini-skirts, is a delight as sassy Sandra.And the shopfloor resolve is perfectly pitched by Ellen Halliday, as Cassie, and Julie Craig, as Connie.Relationships, friendships and even governments are tested in this factual story which, historically, helped females eventually earn an equal footing when it came to filling up pay packets.Robin Murray could challenge Mike Yarwood with his hilarious performance as Harold Wilson.And hes regularly brought down a peg or two by the feisty Rachel Inglis as Barbara Castle.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a battle of the classes as much as the sexes, with Jodie Millar and Yvonne Mitchell providing some gentried grace.The dialogue is a delight, the foot-to-the-floor pace is perfect, and the choreography, costumes, straight from Carnaby Street, and score makes sure this is a production that will strike a chord for decades to come.But for any musical production to be a success, it needs songs.From the brilliant opening scene, this show doesnt disappoint.Busy Women, Everybody Out and Viva Eastbourne are nothing other than tremendous encore numbers that bring out the very best of this talented cast.But perhaps the highlights are Julie Craigs sensational take on the riveting Same Old Story, Rachel Inglis reaching the high notes in the incredible Ideal World, and the delightful duet of Stuart Mitchell and Kirsty Cleland with the making-up masterpiece Im Sorry, I Love You.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a celebration of women fighting for their rights.While it succeeds, this move away from the comfort zone is more of a testament to just how good Selkirk Musical Theatre Company has become.If you havent yet got your tickets... join the picket line quickly and dont be disappointed.Made in Dagenham the Musical runs every night this week at .pm with an additional matinee performed on Saturday at pm.CASTRita OGrady -

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 1 2019","story":"Ellen Sager, , from Tumbler Ridge, sent a letter to the Courier in August , asking for information about her Campbeltown-born grandfather, Thomas Douglas.Ellen said she knew very little except what her mother, Isabella, who emigrated to Canada in , had written in her grandmother Bessie’s obituary.It read that -year-old Bessie was the widow of Thomas Douglas, a lighthouse keeper who drowned at McArthur#s Head Lighthouse, Islay, in November , just nine months after Isabella was born.Ellen received two replies to her  request, from relatives who gave her the name and address of Robert Douglas, Thomas#s nephew, who was born in Campbeltown in  but moved to Australia in .Ellen said: #When I contacted Robert, he said he did not know that his uncle Thomas had a family.#I have been blessed to have many letters that Robert has written describing le in Campbeltown.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

People pick up dferent ideas from other peoplersquos weddings and events in other parts of the world and then they want that for themselves. Itrsquos an aspiration thing and the Internet has a lot to play, making people more educated, savvy and know what they want. Because of this, people think out the box and are able to put their own personal touch on the wedding to make it unique.Thinking outside the box is definitely what Hassanrsquos clients do well. The biggest wedding he has planned in his career involved a dizzying , guests. With clients more cost-savvy now, he describes how over-the-top ideas from couples are never far.ldquoThe craziest idea wersquove had was when a couple wanted , flowers hung from the ceiling two years ago, Hassan remembers, amused. ldquoIn big spaces like conference rooms, it softens the space, but these things are expensive - particularly with fresh flowers - so we then have to look at the next best thing, how we can achieve it, how it can be set up. We would then have to work with other professionals who can work at heights.In the first episode, we get to see a wedding being put together in the cityrsquos Crowne Plaza as Hassan and his staff scramble to hang hundreds of flowers from the ceiling, albeit fake ones.He explains: ldquoFresh flowers are obscene and not everyone can afford it, so we then look at articial flowers, which look just as real. For the sake of a few hours, they want it to look good, obviously.What is it about weddings that have Asian families going over-the top ldquoPakistanis are not that extravagant in their day-to-day lives, but a wedding is when theyrsquoll either be welcoming a new addition to the family or giving their daughter away, so theyrsquoll spend the most, says Hassan.ldquoWith pound, budgets, you have to take everything into consideration, including clothes and jewellery, which are a big expense. Clients travel to Pakistan and India to get their shopping done. Remember, Asian weddings can last for days as well. Some families will put marquees up at home and host pre-wedding events where the whole family comes together. It does add up to quite a lot of money, but the Bank of Mum and Dad can help out. Though, these days, professional couples themselves are very much in control and can pay everything themselves. Many live with their parents so they have that additional income saved up, he adds.Viewers will get to see a Falkirk mum planning a joint walima for her two sons in episode one as Hassanrsquos clients work on ways to cut down costs.Hassan says: ldquoSome will realise itrsquos too extravagant and theyrsquoll decide to put money into a house instead. But, nowadays, clients will cut down on the number of events they have and just roll it all into one day to cut down on costs.Working with demanding clients and large families comes with its tribulations. Hassan says: ldquoWhen yoursquore working with two families trying to create one event, sometimes it gels really well and other times itrsquos the opposite and you get friction. Usually, one family will sit back and let the other take control. If both families have dferent views, they can clash. Irsquove had that before and it does get tricky. Wersquove witnessed barnies happening right in front of us and it can get awkward, but itrsquos just about stepping in and mediating. In the end, theyrsquore always smiling.Itrsquos been his busiest year on record and, as Asian weddings continue to evolve, whatrsquos next for Hassan and his team ldquoWersquore seeing people sht away from having weddings in Scotland and opting for destination weddings.

Tell you that therersquos going to be a referendum on Brexit, that the ERG are back in their box, Jezza has finally come good, and Theresa May has been put in a secure unit. But I canrsquot in all honesty agree with commentators, like the blessed Polly Toynbee, who believe we are now on the road to redemption.Yes, Labour did repeat its promise to hold a referendumJeremy Corbynrsquos ldquoworkable plan of a permanent customs union is rejected ndash as it was in one of last weekrsquos many meaningless votes. Oh, and Labour will support a referendumthere is no General Election. Anda no deal Tory deal looks likely. If, , .ButLabour really wanted to eliminate the threat of no deal, it would have moved heaven and earth to deliver the SNPrsquos motion calling for precisely that.Looking back on this dismal week, the standout, surely, is the arrant insanity of Parliament ndash a rational body of elected representatives ndash failing to take the opportunity to rule out an event which would put the army on the streets, interrupt food and medicine supplies, and cause the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.Yes, the Yvette Cooper Oliver Letwin amendmentwas endorsed by Parliament overwhelmingly, after Theresa May gave it the nod. This means that there will be an extension to Article Parliament doesnrsquot support a deal by March . Well and good. If therersquos one thing the UK Parliament is supremely good at itrsquos failing to agree.It doesnrsquot like Mayrsquos botched deal, the Norway option, EFTA or any other solution that Brussels thinks acceptable. So that means an extension is inevitable. Except that the French president Emmanuel Macron and the Brussels negotiator, Michel Barnier, have made clear that the  countries of the EU , will only contemplate delaying Britainrsquos departure from the EUit is for ldquoa purpose. Holding more meaningless votes, staging more ministerial resignations and arguing on College Green outside Parliament do not, one suspects, constitute a legitimate purpose.Still, everyone seems convinced that an extension is in the bag. This led to largely unwarranted excitement on the Remain side. With Labour calling for a Peoplersquos Voteand Theresa Mayrsquos deadline finally breached, Twitter went into orbit. Lord Adonis all but declared victory in the Battle of Brexit. Europhiles were dancing in the streets, metaphorically at least, and jeering at the nasty Brexiters who had been defeated by the forces of good. It was like the last reel of Lord of the Rings.But such triumphalism was premature. Much as I wish it were the case, there is still no majority in Parliament for a referendum. Stephen K Bush, the political editor of the New Statesman, has been counting them out and counting them back in again and he is adamant that the Labour Brexit rebels will prevent any motion for a referendum passing through Parliament. He says at least  Labour MPs are opposed. Hersquos right.ldquoRebels here is something of a misnomer since there is widespread belief that Brexit is the outcome desired by their leader. Indeed, on one interpretation of last weekrsquos events, Jeremy Corbyn has managed to find a way to secure Brexit while also appearing to support a referendum. This is because what is called the Kyle Wilson amendment.This cross-party proposal, which Labour is minded to support on March , calls for MPs to agree to Theresa Mayrsquos deal , but only on the condition that there is a referendum to validate it. Bingo. Labour can tell all its working-class Brexit supporters in target marginals that, yes, it didnrsquot block Brexit. But Jeremy can also curry favour with the Remainiacs of Islington by appearing to support a Peoplersquos Vote.Itrsquos very clever, but to my mind somewhat bonkers. Why would Labour help pass Theresa Mayrsquos deal, which Jeremy Corbyn has said is worse than no deal, would lose thousands of jobs and would lock the UK into a backstop from which it cannot escape  At least this is what he has said repeatedly in the Commons.Surely, a vote is a vote. Theresa May could legitimately say that her deal has been endorsed by Parliament, and call on Labour to campaign for it in any referendum. Not that she has the slightest intention of calling a referendum.Theresa Mayrsquos strategy is the same as it ever was: not listening, nothing has changed, take it or leave it. It pains me to say it, but the Prime Minister at least has a strategy. It is to run down the clock, while allowing the ious tribes in Parliament and in her Cabinet, to fall out among themselves.Itrsquos working. Labour is moving ever more in the direction of her deal, however much they may deny it. Parliament canrsquot agree on anything.There are tears in Cabinet and more resignations ndash  from the Government so far. But whorsquos counting  The European Research Group ndash that comically misnamed faction of extreme Brexiters ndash has reportedly split over William Rees-Moggrsquos equivocation on the Irish backstop.And while all about is chaos and acrimony, so ticks away the clock until Brexit day. Twenty-eight days at the time of writing. Goodness me, is that really the time  Yes it is. As in the film of the same name, the zombies are stirring.I accept that is an offensive way to describe Nigel Faragersquos ldquoBrexit Betrayal march from Sunderland to London. But it could get nasty on the road.What do I think will happen in the end  As Irsquove been saying in this column since Christmas, I think Parliament will block a no-deal Brexit. There will be an extension of Article , and Labour will probably end up backing Mayrsquos deal, or abstaining on it which amounts to the same thing.If Labour, by some remote chance, continues to reject Mayrsquos deal or its iants, in the meaningful vote on the inglorious twelfth, then I think MPs would still reject a referendum. There is still no majority for one, and Labourrsquos die-hard Brexiters are not for turning.Which makes the most likely option ndash about the only one Theresa May can authorise as PM under her prerogative powers ndash would be to revoke Article . Pull the plug. End it.OK, so thatrsquos wishful thinking on my part. Her Government would fall and precipitate an election. But looking at the chaos that is Brexit, and the lack of time, it seems as good a shout as any, especiallyBrussels reject a meaningless extension.If Britain canrsquot decide how to leave the EU, an extension to Article  would be pointless. The sensible thing to do would be to cancel Brexit, go away, and think again."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-so-thats-what-tutti-frutti-is-about","story":"THE news story in The Herald about a drunk having to call the police after falling asleep in a Greenock pub toilet and being locked in, reminded George Dale in Beith: \"When I was  I attended a stag night and we ended up in a Chinese restaurant near Charing Cross.

At the heart of this ambition lies our commitment to fair work.For employees fair work means decent wages, secure contracts and just working practices. Fair work is not only right in principle, it also results in better health and greater wellbeing for workers. In turn this drives creativity, innovation and productivity. It also reduces staff turnover, which means increased profitability for businesses.With employment reserved to Westminster, Scotland does not yet have the powers to make fair work a legal requirement, but that doesnrsquot stop us from taking as much action as we can to encourage fair work practices.For years the Scottish Government has championed good employment practices through schemes such as the Scottish Business Pledge and Living Wage accreditation, and we are now strides ahead of the rest of the UK in many areas.There are now , accredited Living Wage Employers in Scotland. We also have a higher proportion of employees paid at least the real living wage than any other UK nation. We have gone further than any other part of the UK to help eradicate blacklisting from public contracts, and we have ensured that no person directly employed by the Scottish Government is on an exploitative zero hours contract.:Scottish and Welsh parliaments to vote on Brexit oppositionItrsquos great progress and we want to do even more to support workers and businesses across the country, which is why we have been working with the Fair Work Convention and the Scottish Trades Union Congress on the Fair Work Action Plan.The plan sets out a range of new measures to embed good practice, with tailored approaches to meet the needs of inidual businesses.It includes setting up a new Fair Work service for small and micro employers, a new target of increasing the number of employees paid the real living wage by , over the next three years, a revamp of the Scottish Business Pledge to fully align it with fair work practices, and a learning network to better support businesses who want to sign up and meet these objectives.Wersquore working hand in hand with unions and employers to put fair work first in a truly meaningful way. This is an approach that is good for workers, good for businesses and good for Scotland as a whole, and that is why wersquore so determined to lead by example.Ultimately, for as long as employment law is reserved to Westminster the Scottish Governmentrsquos ability to eradicate unfair working practices will be limited, but that wonrsquot stop us acting where we can.Another area which remains substantially reserved to Westminster, but where some new powers are nevertheless allowing us to take a dramatically dferent approach to the rest of the UK is social security.:Scotland best part of UK for workplace gender ersitySince the Social Security Act was passed by the Scottish Parliament last year, we have been able to improve the lives of thousands of people across the whole of Scotland.We have delivered the Carersrsquo Allowance Supplement, paying out more than pound million to over , carers. Wersquove also put pound. million into the pockets of more than , families in Scotland through the new Best Start Grant. In fact since our new agency, Social Security Scotland first opened its doors, we have paid out an additional pound million to people across the country. That is already making a real dference - but there is so much more to come.This year there will be four new benefits to help carers and low-income families, and we have now announced that we will take responsibility for the rest of the devolved benefits from next April. From there we will roll out disability and carers benefits, and winter weather payments.Having these powers is good for the Scottish Parliament but it will be truly transformational for the people in Scotland who for too long have felt the failures of the UK Governmentrsquos callous approach to benefits.And having these powers means that we are able to build a dignied, respectful social security system, with benefits co-designed with the people of Scotland.These powers have broken new ground and by the end of the process ndash which takes time because of the complexities involved and the need to get it right ndash we will have accomplished the most complicated extension of devolution since the Parliament was reconvened  years ago.It shows how Scotland can choose a dferent path and create a more equal and prosperous country, with fairness at its core.Imagine what more we could dowe held the full range of powers of independent Parliaments.This article originally appeared in The Evening Times"},{"url":null,"title":"snp-economic-plan-would-torpedo-indyref2-alliance","story":"Colin Fox, co-convener of the Scottish Socialist Party and a former board member of the last Yes campaign, said the Growth Commission would ldquotorpedo another -style alliance.He said it reminded him of ldquosomething New Labour could have produced, adding: ldquoI sat on the Yes Scotland Advisory Board and played a constructive, collegiate role.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust. This is helpful in identying accident black spots and monitoring for environmental hazards and poisons, and potential wildle crime.\"Tuesday  Mar  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"Delay to Wick 20 mph speed limit plans","story":"THE brakes have been put on plans to introduce a  mph speed limit on the majority of roads in Wick.The proposal was mooted by Highland Council as a way to improve road safety and encourage walking and cycling.However, Wick members of the Caithness committee this week described the scheme as \"a blunt instrument\" and said other measures to reduce speed would be more effective.

It’s perhaps no surprise that the transport secretary refused to say he had confidence in HIAL’s management the last time I asked him.

Speaking on behalf of the four Scottish Health charities, Angela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland said: “It’s less than four weeks until March  and people are telling us how anxious and concerned they are about the lack of clarity and detail.#As leading patient voice charities, representing hundreds of thousands of people, we have a responsibility to articulate the very real worries and fears many have about the supply, distribution and storage of medicines in a no deal Brexit.“Insulin, for example, is a daily le-saving necessity for thousands of people with diabetes, and any delay or interruption to access would be incredibly dangerous.“Anti-epileptic drugs are also a daily necessity for people with epilepsy.#Any delay or change in the makeup of the drugmight trigger seizures in someone whose condition has been well-managed for many years with no guarantee they will be seizure free again.#Additionally, emergency rescue medication, like midazolam, is a vital lesaving drug for people with dficult to manage epilepsy. Any interruption to supply raises serious concern and may result in avoidable deaths.“There are many other drugs and medical supplies which are equally critical to health.“We are urgently calling on the Scottish Government to produce the detail required to reassure the Scottish public that all relevant organisations involved in the supply, storage and local distribution of medicines in Scotland, have robust systems and agreements in place.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The turnout was  per cent.Prospect has said it will consult representatives next week before confirming industrial action plans. The action is likely to start in April and continue through the summer.This situation arose after HIAL airport controllers sought a pay rise, as they said they were being paid half as much as their counterparts in other areas. However, HIAL said this isn#t the case and proposals were rejected by Scottish Ministers.Prospect negotiations officer David Avery said: “Our members at HIAL undertake highly skilled roles, much in demand across the UK and Europe, but due to public sector pay restraint their pay has fallen signicantly behind the rest of the industry.“Air Traffic Controllers do not want to have to take this action but ministers’ refusal to engage with the issue of pay has left them with no choice. Prospect remains ready to negotiate at any point to avoid this action but ministers must come back to the table with a new meaningful offer.”HIAL managing director Inglis Lyon, has responded to news of the ballot, saying: “We are disappointed Air Traffic Controlcolleagues have chosen to take industrial action that is likely to have a signicant impact on passengers and the communities we serve in the Highlands and Islands.#The Prospect union has sought a double-digit pay award. As a government sponsored agency, HIAL must follow the Scottish Government pay policy. We cannot implement pay awards more than that directed by government.#HIAL made a pay award offer to all staff which was accepted following an overall ballot of trade union members and paid to all staff at the end of September .  This was backdated to  April  and saw colleagues receive increases of up to three per cent in line with Scottish Government Pay Remit Guidelines.#Prospect ATC members rejected the pay settlement, but nonetheless received the increase.#We are open to holding further talks with Prospect on a recruitment and retention allowance for Air Traffic Control staff that would further bolster an attractive remuneration package that already includes excellent pension benefits and holiday entitlements.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Given that controllers have now voted to go on strike, it would appear that the problems extend more widely than just centralisation.“Given the leline nature of our air services, the impact that industrial action will have on those services must be taken extremely seriously.

From isles patients attending hospital appointments to local businesses trying to remain competitive, these services are a genuine leline.“Even at this late stage, we would urge HIAL and the unions to get back round the table and resolve this dispute.  Ministers must also do everything possible to help broker a resolution and avoid the massive disruption any airport closures would inevitably cause.#Following Friday#s announcement from the Prospect union, that air traffic controllers under their membership had voted to undertake industrial action, HIAL said, as a government-sponsored agency, they had to follow the Scottish Government pay policy, and could not implement pay awards more than that directed by the government.A Scottish Government spokesman has since weighed in on the situation, saying: “HIAL has implemented a pay rise for all staff, which is a signicant improvement on previous years, as well as signicantly increasing their contribution to their pension scheme in order to maintain this benefit for employees. Staff also continue to receive generous annual leave, sick pay and other allowances.“In the face of the UK Government’s continued budget cuts, the Scottish Government delivered a distinctive and progressive Pay Policy for   — one which is fair, supports those on lower incomes and protects public sector jobs and services while delivering value for money for the people of Scotland.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

So does Nicola Sturgeon’s comment about the possibility of forming a coalition government with Labouranother snap election’s called at Westminster. Askedshe might form a Labour-SNP coalition, Nicola Sturgeon said last week she was “ready to work with other parties” to oppose the Conservatives’ disastrous Brexit plans. The Conservatives also seem to be upping the ante. Last week an anonymous government minister warned “there’ll be no escaping the Brexit disaster for Scots”. He or she was apparently just one among “a number of senior figures” briefing the BBC against the prospect of another indyref. Methinks they doth protest too much. Meanwhile there are suggestions that the Scottish Tories have urged the Prime Minister to “keep hold of all the cards” in the event of a second referendum so that London decides the date, question and franchise – a clear acknowledgment that allowing under-s and non-European citizens to vote again would be enough toa small Yes vote right now.In  most EU nationals voted No, after scare stories that an iScotland would be forced to quit the EU. But since the Brexit vote and the UK government’s failure to guarantee rights to folk who’ve made their entire lives in Britain, almost every EU national still here will back independence second time around. They won’t be fooled again.Similarly, , - and -year-olds voted in  and around  per cent backed independence, according to a poll carried out by Tory donor Lord Ashcroft. Since the next indyref will also determine access to jobs in Europe, the result’s likely to be an even stronger Yes vote among young Scots next time. Last week’s ridiculous claim by David Mundell suggests he also knows how Brexit may soon change the political landscape north of the Border.The Scots Secretary said Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP actually want a no-deal Brexit to “pursue their fantasy of independence”. Mr Mundell insisted: “They pretend to oppose no deal, yet no deal is their real aim. They hope it will cause chaos, confusion and boost support for independence. Everything  that they do or say on Brexit has been a publicity stunt.”Now a man who shares party membership with Chris ‘no resignation’ Grayling, Boris ‘zipwire’ Johnson and Jacob ‘backstop-ultimatum’ Rees Mogg has clearly had practice in recognising the hallmarks of the cynical gesture and the empty stunt. But suggesting Nicola Sturgeon wants a no deal Brexit – are you having a laugh  Since Mr Mundell has clearly been on another planet for the last two years, he’s missed the fact that Sturgeon’s been getting pelters from Yessers for appearing more interested in saving Britain than readying Scotland for indyref. Chaos might well look like “the best backdrop for another campaign for independence” to politicians who are quite prepared to break up Britain and wreck livelihoods over hysterical fears about foreign workers and dogmatic beliefs about the benefits of unregulated free trade, but there’s been no occasion over the last two years when the First Minister has forgotten the entirely negative long-term impact of Brexit on Scotland, realising that dferent cross-border trade arrangements aren’t ideal birthing conditions for any new state.You can only conclude that the sudden eruption of rattling by Tories north and south of the Border means Whitehall expects the SNP leader to call for another Section  order sooner rather than later.And why might that be – because any kind of Brexit, hard or soft, on  March or a few months later, opens up a whole new set of scenarios for Scotland.Once Britain has actually withdrawn from the EU, it’s likely that the EU and the smaller trade body EFTA will approach Scotland offering rival membership deals in the event of a vote for independence second time around.Senior officials in Iceland are openly discussing the many advantages of having Scotland as a new member of the EFTA halfway house and thereby creating a powerful bloc with three contiguous North Atlantic states controlling vital sea routes, fishing grounds, oil and gas fields and a vast wind, marine and geothermal renewable energy resource. If Gavin McCrone was writing another memerandum to ministers today about the strategic and economic potential of such a move, he might again conclude an independent Scotland “would tend to be in chronic surplus to a quite embarrassing degree”, eventhe big income from decades of oil and gas predicted  years ago has largely been squandered by successive UK governments.Meanwhile, academics at the recent Oxford conference on Rewriting the UK Constitution have predicted that the EU will make a public offer to Scotland once Brexit means there’s no further risk in offending Britain and no conflict of interest in wooing the Scots instead. And why wouldn’t the EU want us  Regaining five million generally progressive, pro-EU citizens in the wake of Britain’s acrimonious departure would be an important boost to the European project.Any bidding war between EFTA and the EU would serve to bolster the viability of Scottish independence, consolidate a new Brexit-oriented strategy and increase support for another Scottish vote. Of course who knows what will happen next with Brexit Theresa May’s deal may get the go-ahead, but her new assurances on the Irish backstop may not satisfy Brexiteers. An extension to Article , allowing time for a second Brexit vote, might let the SNP trade support for an understanding on a future Section  order. In short, things are hotting up on the independence front even though the issue and the SNP have been virtually cut out of mainstream political debate.Momentum is building and those opposing Scotland’s right to self-determination in the light of Brexit know it.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dani garavelli celebrities like stacey dooley should think twice about comic relief","story":"There are ways to help developing countries that do not involve fetishising human suffering or ignoring our country#s complicity in their plight, writes Dani GaravelliIt’s a shame an important discussion about the tone of Comic Relief has been focused so directly, and so vituperatively, on one woman – Stacey Dooley, and I can’t help wonderingthe fact she’s glamorous and female has something to do with how she has been targeted. I am not suggesting the Instagram photograph she posted with a random black child on her hip is unproblematic. MP David Lammy was right to point out it plays on all those tired old “white saviour” tropes. But Dooley is not just some C-list celebrity who has popped her head into Uganda to boost her own profile. She may currently be dancing on Strictly, but she is also a documentary maker with a track record of tackling serious subjects: sweat shops, people trafficking and child soldiers. Forcing her to take the flak for the cloying paternalism of Comic Relief seems harsh and lets an awful lot of other people off the hook.Thirty years after Live Aid, most people of my generation, who sang along with gusto to Do They Know It’s Christmas  cannot hear the line: “So tonight thank God it’s them instead of you” without a visceral sense of shame. We recognise, now, the flaws in the privileged pop stars’ approach: the way Live Aid treated the continent of Africa as homogeneous and its people as unormly helpless the way it presented Bob Geldof as a saint and relied on dehumanising shots of starving babies to guilt-trip comfortable First Worlders into donating.We understand – or at least we ought to – that this sort of relief effort risks disempowering those it purports to help and deflects from the UK’s role as an oppressor that plundered many benighted countries of their resources.Yet, despite this – and many high-profile calls for the West to confront the legacy of its imperial past – a sanitised and white-centred attitude towards racism and the developing world remains widespread.We saw it at this year’s Oscars. Two years after Moonlight, a sensitive portrayal of black masculinity, won best film, Hollywood suffered a relapse, handing the award to Green Book, a buddy movie – made by white director Peter Farrelly – in which a northern white bigot agrees to drive a brilliant, but repressed black musician on a tour of the Deep South. And guess what  The white driver is the main character. And the story is seen through his eyes. And it turns out he’s not so bad after all. He teaches the black musician about black culture. They listen to Little Richard and eat fried chicken. And, in the end, the lonely black musician celebrates Christmas with his driver’s big white Italian family. No wonder Spike Lee walked out in disgust.We see it too in the sixth-formers heading out to build clinics across the developing world. It’s all very well-intended, but – as they hold ceilidhs and race nights to fund their trips – do they ever stop to consider who benefits  Is it the local residents who could – with the money raised – have been trained to do construction work themselves  Or is it mostly about their own egos and CVs Founder Richard Curtis saw Comic Relief as Live Aid for comedians so of course it came with a similar condescending vibe. The very first one, at Christmas , saw Lenny Henry broadcasting from a refugee camp in the Sudan.The format was always excruciating. High jinks interspersed with war zones, cake sales interspersed with pot-bellied infants. Happy face sad face, like Alex the Lion in Madagascar .Not so long ago such comments would have you written off as po-faced and tight, but in recent years the backlash against “poverty porn” has grown. In , the Radi-Aid awards nominated three films, involving Tom Hardy, Eddie Redmayne and Ed Sheeran, for the title of most offensive campaign of the year. The one that attracted most attention was Sheeran’s Comic Relief video, in which the singer offered to pay hotel costs for street children in Liberia. Sheeran was presented as a Messiah figure, dispensing western largesse. In the wake of that controversy, Liz Warner, CEO of Comic Relief, which runs Sports Relief and Red Nose Day, pledged the organisation would change its ways, and push African voices to the fore. Last year, a film about street children in Kampala was introduced by Rio Ferdinand, but he did not appear in it. Instead, a Ugandan charity worker and the children explained the issues to the viewer.Unfortunately, Dooley’s Instagram pictures – and the charity’s response to Lammy’s criticism – suggest it has fallen back into its old ways. Instead of reflecting on the validity of the MP’s words, it accused him of failing to respond to its offer for him to go to Africa – again that generic reference to an entire continent – and make a film himself. This was defensive, untrue and missed the point. Lammy did respond, but declined the offer, which is understandable given he wasn’t asking Comic Relief to give a  to British politicians but to indigenous voices.The furore prompted many angry-from-Manchester types to rant on about a lack of gratitude, thus proving Lammy’s point: that the Comic Relief model requires humility and submission from its beneficiaries. In reality, no-one was suggesting the £bn-plus Comic Relief has raised was unnecessary or unwelcome just that there are ways to help developing countries that do not involve fetishising human suffering or ignoring our country’s complicity in their plight. If I were going to tackle the “white saviour” syndrome, I would start in schools and particularly with To Kill A Mocking Bird. With his liberal benevolence firmly rooted in privilege, Atticus Finch is the archetypal white saviour, whose fate takes precedence over that of Tom Robinson, the black man he unsuccessfully defends against  accusations of rape. As long as the politics of Harper Lee’s book go unchallenged in classrooms, her paternalistic perspective is likely to persist.Lammy’s solution is for Comic Relief to have African voices counter lazy stereotypes. One comedian he suggested the programme might promote is Kenyan-born Njambi McGrath. In a clipposted on his Twitter feed, McGrath suggests western backpackers who take off for the developing world are “detoxing from privilege”.“I hear you went to Africa my love,” she says. “Tell me, where in Africa did you go  Let me guess. Did you visit the medieval city built by the Shona people of Great Zimbabwe  Or perhaps maybe you went and spent some time in the ancient kingdom of the Baganda people  And they will say ‘I went to an orphanage.

The First Minister warned the PM’s deal would be “disastrous”, saying that ending freedom of movement could cut the number of people working and paying taxes in the country, with the NHS and social care sectors particularly badly hit.She added: “The deal on the table guarantees us more years of uncertainty during which Scotland’s interests will be at the mercy of a vicious, seemingly never-ending Tory civil war on Europe - one where I am afraid to say the extreme Brexiteers currently appear to be in the ascendancy.“It could open up our markets to US produces which for very good reasons are currently banned and it will damage our economy, our living standards and our National Health Service.“The Prime Minister’s deal would be disastrous and must be rejected by the House of Commons.”She again made the case for a second vote on Brexit, insisting there was a “strong democratic case for that” as the Leave campaign had been “deliberately vague, some may say deceitful, about the form Brexit would take”.The SNP leader said: “Simply pressing ahead with Brexit knowing we are heading for disaster makes no sense at all. After all, whatever most people voted for it certainly was not where we find ourselves now.“A second referendum provides everyone with a second opportunity.”Explaining why Scottish Conservative MSPs voted against the motion, Jackson Carlaw accused the SNP of using Brexit for its own political ends.The interim party leader claimed Theresa May’s deal would provide a “smooth and workable” Brexit, had been backed by  other EU member states, and would lay the groundwork for a “strong and abiding friendship” with them going forward.He said: “The number of people who voted to Leave was the largest number of people to vote for anything in our history.“And while they have largely been forgotten in this place, let us not forget that they included one million people in Scotland – more than the number who voted for the SNP in the most recent Westminster election of .“Almost every study into the  vote has shown that Leave voters knew exactly what they were voting for: to gain independence from supranational institutions and to get greater control of their community and our borders.“And every fair analysis of the withdrawal agreement suggests that is exactly what Brexit is delivering. That, I would suggest, is why people who actually voted Leave still overwhelmingly stand by their decision.“I believe that the Withdrawal Agreement and the political declaration that goes with it are worthy of our support.“Even a year or  months ago, a deal was far from inevitable. We now have it in our grasp.”Scottish Labour voted in favour, along with party colleagues in Cardf, with leader Richard Leonard calling for a People’s Vote.

How very petty of you.

I#m glad to hear it Ian.So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration You mean you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century  Nation-states have existed throughout human history and patriotism # or nationalism # is a normal part of human social experience, as evidenced in innumerable great artistic works, for example.Where things go wrong is where one nation-state wants to conquer and control others. But that has a dferent name: imperialism.Well Carl, when it comes to education and this of literature, I would rather have a book written by a british,not scottish, author than this of an american, in which to study or reflect on with regard to literary works used for educational purposes. Quite rightly, these books, written by foreigners##sorry, yanks, should be taken out of the national curriculum and author#s unique to the UK or Scotland selected instead.I must confess, I am a little worried and concerned about the UKIP doing so well in the European Election#s considering Mr Farrage is a more extreme version of the vile Tories, and how he gives the impression of a nationalist, xenophobic buffoon where, I feel,we do leave the EU, he will, like the vile Tories, be in a position to rule and do as he pleases without being answerable to anybody, namely the EU under the European Human Rights Act. Many people may criticize the EHRA, but I would dread to think what this country would be like without it     David, you never fail to amaze me.You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner and then go on to criticise nationalism and xenophobia.You really do believe in taking the scatter gun approach to political philosophy.Without the European Human Rights Act there would be an awful lot less terrorists running round for a start, old hook hands would of been deported along with his pals years ago, The   tube an bus bombings may never of taken place, an Cherie Blair would have a few less £millions in the bank. Any and all of these options are preferable to what we have now.At the last general election when the Lib Dems signed a pact with the Conservatives the writing was on the wall, they blew it big time and will never in the future be able to have an influence on British politics.Maybethey had made a coalition with Labour it might have been dferent but now its too late, any vote for Liberal in the future will be a vote wasted.The study of English literature should, in my view, encompass all literature written in the English language, including its many dialects and historic iations. That should include studying local writers, but not to the exclusion of international authors.We study literature for all sorts of reasons, but bolstering national pride or trashing another nation shouldn#t be amongst them.If we were to go down the road of only studying our own literature, Scots students would never study Shakespeare or Dickens, English students would never study Burns or Lewis Grassic Gibson, neither would study Melville or Twain, and all would be worse off for it.The attack on the English curriculum has come from the dreadful Michael Gove, but it could quite easily have come from Nigel Farage who hates hearing non-English accents, let alone reading non-English texts.UKIP under Farage represents a severely authoritarian threat to our liberty which should not be under-estimated. So far we#ve only seen the tip of this particular iceberg.Farage is married to a German so he hears a foreign accent every day, such a pity you only soak up what murdochs media tell you instead of a few facts.How very true John, they, the LibDems, know how to go out with a bang##so to speak.

You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner #lol Malcolm, I was being slightly sarcastic in my response to what literature teachers should be using to teach with ###.but on a more serious point, I do not see why teachers cannot use books written by scottish or british authors to demonstrate literature and its meaning##..within and between the lines. I am sure, as you might agree, there is just as equally good examples of literature within the boundaries of our own country or the UK in which to use for educational purposes  I wasn#t specically saying every foreign book should be banned##.it was, as said sarcastically, yank#..sorry, american in the context of the subject.Theo Smith and the other  Shetland Lib-Dem voters might explain why they like it so much. But they won#t.Are you unable to express your own views Brian  because that link is your longest post by far.Carl Pickard, in answer to # Ian. So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration # I am strongly forUnity of all humanity, that does not mean I carte blancheagree with of all the attemptsand mechanisms to forge those unities by politicians. However the EU is a vast improvement of what went before it. WW and WW were the result of the preceding collection of sovereign nation states.On balance I there for do support the EU, however there are grounds to improve it, not demolish it. I most definitely agree with immigration and the opening of borders to all friendly states and cultures..Britain has benefited hugely due to its ersity of cultures.If anyone advocates banning immigration and sending #them# home, would they expect all UK and Scottish ex pats to be expelled from wherever they are and be sent backThat would be fun would it not I would expect to be deportedfrom whatever country I was in other than my ownI broke their laws. I would not expect that country to feed clothe and house me, nor would I expect free everything, maybe that#s just me as I don#t expect this country to do that for me either . Instead of hysterical rantings of they want to send them all back try actually listening to what they say instead of what the murdoch media say they say.A new experience # Iagree with Ian Tinkler.Robert Sim, in answer to # you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century# I certainly do loath the primitive mentality which is soblind and stupid to realise most of human suffering is simply because Nation States and nationalistsare collectively too selfish to look beyond theirown self interest and belief in racial superiority.. Nationalism is a prime example of that and Salmond and his NATS a great example. Our oil, we are better, fairer, alone we would be wealthier, ect,ect and all that self righteous rubbish. Also nationalism goes a bit beyond great artistic works, a few examples : The Holocaust ,Omagh bombing , Bloody Sunday. Ethnic cleansing . Tribal massacresCambodian genocide , these are a few examples of hundreds of incidents..These killings have little to do with imperialism, more about tribalism and a self belief in racial superiority. #The simple fact is we are all the same species with exactly the same ancestry and emotions.# Very true, Ian.

In  he was accepted into the prestigious Hornsey School of Art, where he made his mark in etching and printmaking with his graduation piece ‘At the Ebb’ being selected for exhibition in the Royal Academy Summer Show.After further enhancing his reputation and craft as a member of the Glasgow Print Studio, which he joined in the mid-s, Tommy ed to Portree in  and founded Skye Original Prints.A combination of gallery and workshop # that drew in many visitors- the space also provided a base for the printmaker to create works which he would go on to sell around the world.With the Isle of Skye Gallery opened this week, the former creative hub of the celebrated Sgitheanach artist could act as an exciting  for current talent on the island.. “It just needed a wee bit of decorating really. I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"name chosen for skye resort following cash prize","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe hotel will be situated on the site of the former golf course on the Struan Road in Portree.After receiving close to  entries, Mr Charles Garton Jones # a London-based property developer who also owns the Cow Shed, a boutique bunkhouse in Uig # picked the winning name # #The Bracken Hide#, which was submitted by Skeabost resident Ian Williams.“In all, we had nearly  suggestions,” said Mr Garton Jones. “It was great fun going through them and narrowing them down, but there was one that stood out from the crowd. #The Bracken Hide#, we thought, conveyed a lovely feeling of exploring the wilderness.”Mr Williams, who received a cheque for £ for his winning suggestion, said the idea was prompted by a photo of the resort which sparked a memory from his childhood. He said: “For me, it was the image that was in the press of the building and particularly the roof, which was covered in greenery.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

The speed restrictions will apply at all times for the safety of road users ‎until works are fully completed.The Department has programmed the work and traffic management arrangements to minimise any inconvenience, however, drivers should expect some delays and are advised to leave additional time when planning any journeys.Completion of the work by  April  is dependent on favourable weather conditions, however, the Department will keep the public informed of any change.For traffic information about this and other improvement schemes visit: www.trafficwatchni\"  \"  Ireland, Lions and Ulster Rugby legend Willie John McBride honoured by the QueenUrinated on the shelves at Tesco and struck security guard on eye Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"academy runners star at ulster schools cross country championships","story":"Banbridge Academy#s Bethany Nixon was the star of the show at the Ulster Schools# Cross Country Championships where she ran a magnicent and dominant race to claim the Gold Medal and title of Inter Girls Ulster Schools Cross Country Champion.

However, committee member Suzanne Warring said she is confident it will open as planned.“We’re looking at everything that is available in the whole postcode,” she said.“There are very few commercial properties in the area, but we have seen everything that there is, so we’re reaching out to everyone to make sure we get an appropriate site. “At this stage we are still confident we will be opening in September. My daughter is one of the ones who will be going to the school in September and we certainly expect that to happen. Over the next couple of weeks we hope to get the building secured and then we will have enough time to prepare. Because we have the money in place and all of the groundwork has been done in advance, we should be able to open as planned.”According to Ms Warring, the naíscoil has already had an unprecedented amount of applications, which are indicative of a growing demand for Irish-medium education in the area.“It is massively encouraging,” she enthused.“To think that your kids can go to a local naíscoil, bunscoil, or meánscoil in the future is fantastic. It really shows how much things have changed here. The naiscoil is the start and we hope to build on that. We’re trying to build a community around it. There are a lot more Irish speakers in the area than we would have known and it will create a place for those people, and for those who just want to learn.”She continued: “Because of the non-denominational ethos of Irish medium education, we welcome applications from everyone in the community and the inclusive, child-centred nature of Irish medium is exactly what the area needs. “We had an amazing turnout at The Ivanhoe in December for our information morning. Many parents don#t have Irish themselves but we know from the success of our existing Gaelscoileanna that this is not an issue. “The momentum is there and the funding is ready to go. “The committee is working diligently to secure suitable premises to open the doors in September  as planned. We would welcome input from anyone with suitable premises or sites to get in touch so that we can make this vision a reality.

Likewise, the countdown to Cheltenham begins in earnest for local punters after the hugely-popular Sean Graham preview night at Belfast’s Europa Hotel.This year’s top table included the top trainer from last year’s Festival Gordon Elliott along with David Casey, assistant trainer to his rival Willie Mullins.Noel Meade’s stable jockey Sean Flanagan joined the line up along with Mark ‘The Couch’ Winstanley , Richard Hoiles , Gary O’Brienwhile Bookmakers Brian and Ronan Grahamwere on hand to provide the latest odds and give their insights.If the  of experts are to believed, Clan Des Obeaux, an impressive winner of the King George, won’t be winning this year’s Gold Cup, or any other Gold Cup for that matter.Last year’s RSA Chase hero Presenting Percy was the almost unanimous selection from the top table. There was a good each-way shout for Elliott’s Shattered Love , but the Co Meath trainer insisted he’d love to be training Presenting Percy. David Casey was keen on whatever Mullins aims at the race , but cautioned that he wouldn’t back last year’s winner Native River “with stolen money” following his below-par efforts this season.Elliott appears to have great chance of landing the feature on Day One with the brilliant mare Apple’s Jade.Without giving too much away, he added that he “couldn’t be happier” with Apple’s Jade, who is four from four this season.Defending champion Buveur D’Air was friendless at the top table while Casey reported Laurina to be in rude health, but stressed that she would need to improve on her form having won a weak Mares’ Novices’ Hurdle in .Brain Graham feels the seven-pound Mare’s allowance will be a key factor and thinks Apple’s Jade will prevail.Altior , unsurprisingly, was an almost universal tip to retain the Champion Chase with only Winstanley opting for second-favourite Min .If Buveur D’Air was largely opposed by the  in the Champion Hurdle, Stayers’ Hurdle ante-post favourite Paisley Parkwas described as the lay of the meeting by bookmaker Ronan Graham.The  seemed keen to take on the favourite with the reliable Supasundaeand Faugheen .

won’t be contesting the upcoming local council elections, said he has supported the playpark project since entering Derry City and Strabane District Council.Therefore, it is a facility that he would like to see delivered before the end of his tenure.In  Cllr O’Reilly called a meeting to protest against possible plans to build on the only green space at Coshquin on the outskirts of Derry.  He, along with local residents, objected to a planned car park to accommodate weddings at the Cosh Bar  Grill.He explained: “We started working with residents to develop a playpark and now we’re finally at the design stage.“The pre-design stage is nearly complete and then after that funding will be allocated and the park will be built, so we’ve nearly got it over the line.googletag.cmd.push

to identy adequate provision for the Coshquin area and now council is hosting this event which will bring forward some designs to regenerate the area.“I would encourage as many people from the local community to come out on the evening to look at the plans and to provide their input.”Cllr O’Reilly also gave assurances that fellow Independent Councillor, Sean Carr, who will be running for election in the Foyleside District Electoral Area on May , is committed to seeing the project through.The meeting, hosted by Derry City and Strabane District Council along with local residents, will take place

confirmed.Businesses and houses along the entire Abercorn Road were expected to benefit from a free “facelt”, however, no expressions of interest were received from contractors when Derry City and Strabane District Council put it out to tender.Around  commercial and residential properties are said to have engaged with the scheme.Work, which was supposed to be completed by the end of March, has now been pushed back until at least the end of the summer after the council said it would be “dficult to state a timeline”.“Subject to the successful appointment of a contractor the work should be completed in the summer of this year,” a Council spokesperson said.The total cost of the cosmetic upgrade is £, and will primarily cover facade improvements to commercial and residential properties.The works will comprise of upgrading commercial frontages, such as signage and painting, and decorative interventions to residential properties, namely the painting of front facades only and decorative features of front facades.Last September, to help expedite the project and ensure it met the strict deadline of March , , local councillors were asked to grant delegated authority to Council Chief Executive John Kelpie to sign off on all contracts associated with its delivery.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

between Council, as lead partners and the Executive Office, through its Urban Villages Initiative, City Centre Initiative and Triax Neighbourhood Partnership Board.The Executive Office provided all of the funding for the project meaning there are no financial implications for the council.In a statement to the Derry News, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council has now confirmed that there has been a “slight delay” in the implementation of the Urban Villages Revitalisation Project proposed for Abercorn Road.“The proposed project focuses on the upgrade enhancement of the facades of commercial and residential properties along Abercorn Road and has been warmly welcomed by local business owners and residents.“The delay in the implementation of the project is due to Council receiving no tender submissions, following a public tendering exercise in November December  inviting contractors to bid for the works.”She added: “A second tendering exercise was initiated in January  with a closing date of th February. Subject to there being interest in this tender, and a suitable contractor being appointed, Council anticipates works to commence in March .“Council has previously issued correspondence to all of the participating property owners advising them of the current situation, and hopes to convene a further engagement meeting, following the outcome of the current tendering process.”"},{"url":null,"title":"public urged say re development prehen boathouse","story":"Anyone with an interest in the future of Prehen Boat House is being urged to go along to a public consultation event taking place tomorrowfrom .pm-.pm at The Loughs Agency building.

As everyone knows, Dromara is a strong club but this year surpassed all expectations with the club being the only one in Ireland to have its members win two INFC Nationals.N Black  Son won the Friendship National and N Edgar  Son won the Skibbereen National.The Edgar partnership had a fantastic young bird season as well, winning the NIPA Young Bird National from Rosscarbery.N Black  Son also won the NIPA section D Old Bird Channel fancier.

I just want to try and put out what Irsquove been feeling for a long time.Conal first developed a love for music by listening to his big brotherrsquos Elvis Presley records.He later began to perform as the lead singer with the local band Bone Idle before moving on to Freak Out and then to Sweet Leaf mdash the band he fronted for  years.ldquoIrsquove been fronting rock bands for the last  years since my early twenties and it was always just covers like AC DC, Led Zeppelin and Lynyrd Skynyrd, Conal continued.ldquoBut when I started to write music, that wasnrsquot what was coming out of me. It was more singer songwriter, folky stuff.ldquoIt wasnrsquot really a surprise to me as the stuff I would have listened to outside my giging would have been the likes of Bob Dylan and Steve Earle.Conal is recording his new songs with the band Stillwater, which also features Killyleagh musician Damien Hanna.While he is experiencing a creative purple patch, the father-of-four does not yet know when the music will be available.ldquoI donrsquot have a title for my new EP yet as Irsquom still writing and Irsquom still recording. I would hope that the EP would be out by the summer and the album by the end of the year but you never know, the EP could turn into the album.He and Stillwater performed two of Conalrsquos new tracks, Venus and All of the People, in an interview on That Like That on NVTV.Conal says that the second track is really resonating with people.ldquoThis track is aimed at society in general, not only young people on Facebook, but all those who point the finger at somebody and gang up on some poor soul, he explained.ldquoThen when something happens to that poor soul, then yoursquoll get the smiley faces and comments of lsquoHe was a great fellarsquo or lsquoShe was a great girlrsquo and hopefully it teaches them a lesson to realise what people might be going through on the inside.Conal is a regular at Denvirrsquos in Downpatrick and will next perform with Stillwater in Portrush Town Hall at the North West  in MayTo watch Conalrsquos interview and performance on NVTVrsquos Talk Like That visit twww.nvtv shows talk-like-that-conal-montgomery Conal and Stillwater on their Facebook pages or ring Conal on  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"De La Salle head ‘disappointed’ at decision  ","story":"THE principal of De La Salle School in Downpatrick has spoken of his ldquodisappointment in this weekrsquos statement from the Red High Parents and Friends Association.Mr Ciaran Maguire called on all four schools earmarked for the proposed lsquosuper schoolrsquo in Downpatrick ldquoto come together and put their best foot forward.Mr Maguire said he was disappointed for the trustees of De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos, who ldquohave given so much of their lives to the families in East Down.He described their involvement in education has been one of ldquogreat success and achievement.Mr Maguire said De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos were ldquotwo highly effective schools meeting the needs of young men and women in the greater Downpatrick area.He said the trustees had the confidence of staff, pupils and parents at De La Salle and from the wider business community.Mr Maguire remarked: ldquoWithin my last two years as principal of De La Salle, I have witnessed on a daily basis children going to and from St Patrickrsquos, to St Maryrsquos to De La Salle, accessing a curriculum that isnrsquot possible within their own school and sharing both the knowledge and expertise from each of these schools, where the results have been nothing short of excellent for each pupil.ldquoThis collaboration has been up and running successfully for years and is a model of good practice for other post-primary schools to see.ldquoWhat is wrong in having a rsquosuper schoolrsquo  Do the families in the greater Downpatrick area not deserve it  A school where children regardless of ability can achieve their potential He continued: ldquoThe new school will cater for every child. No child will be disadvantaged or be selected to attend this new school. For once they will have control over their choice of post-primary education.ldquoWhat is proposed is a Catholic school, with a strong Catholic Lasallian ethos. No child will be turned away because of not making the threshold grade. They will wear the same unorm, access the same curriculum and extracurricular activities and be treated with the same care and respect that they currently receive in their respective schools.Mr Maguire added: ldquoThis is something that very few communities in Northern Ireland can avail of.

She spends hours out on the Red High pitch, which is just across the road and she and Josh just compliment each other.ldquoShe is a great wee worker, willing to learn the tricks of the trade and takes everything in her stride, he added.ldquoIdeally, Annie would drove to play in a girlsrsquo only side, but she knows how to mix it with the best come Sunday morning. She is in a mixed team and can handle herself.Josh, who also started out with Celtic Bhoys before moving to Downpatrick FC, was picked up by Solitude scouts after a series of trial games and he now attends training at the North Belfast club twice a week.ldquoHe has come on leaps and bounds since joining Cltonville, said his dad.ldquoHe has won the player of the year for the past two seasons in a row and just loves being part of the set-up at Cltonville.

If there isn’t legally binding change,it is just more assurances or guarantees about the temporary nature of the backstop, that is not going to work.”According to the Sunday Times, the hardline European Research Groupof Tory MPs have indicated they will support the PM’s Brexit dealtheir demands are met, including a legally binding mechanism to escape the backstop.• Morning View: DUP reaction to backstop will be central to fate of UKIn private talks with Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, the ERG called for a legally binding mechanism to escape the backstop, with a clear exit route and an unambiguous rewrite of the language in the government’s legal advice, the newspaper said. The demands were drawn up in conjunction with Mr Dodds, it was reported.Last week, DUP Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson appeared to indicate his party would be willing to accept a time-limited backstop. His remarks led some commentators to suggest that the DUP was softening its stance on Brexit, with former UUP leader Lord Empey accusing the party of “slithering towards a fudge” on Brexit.Jay Donnelly sex picture ‘still in possession of others’Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald hoping to hold talks with chief constable Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Speaking to the News Letter yesterday, Mr Dodds said his party was going to “examine very carefully and critically” whatever concessions the government manages to secure from Brussels.“We will be guided by what the effect of it is. Does it legally change the withdrawal agreement  That is what is clear and important,” he added. “If it doesn’t change the withdrawal agreement and the attorney general can’t change his opinion, it won’t cut the mustard as far as we are concerned.“We have set out a series of tests which measure up to what the prime minister committed to as part of the Brady amendment. We will measure whatever is brought back against those tests.”According to the Sunday Times, the three tests the government must meetthe prime minister is to receive the backing of the ERG and DUP include: • A “clearly worded, legally binding, treaty-level clause which unambiguously overrides” the text of the withdrawal agreement• Language that “must go beyond simply re-emphasising reinterpreting the temporary nature of the backstop” and a change to Cox’s legal advice that it would “endure indefinitely”• A “clear and unconditional route out of the backstoptrade talks fail”, which could mean “a time limit or a unilateral exit mechanism”.Meanwhile, Mr Dodds dismissed allegations that his party had softened its stance on the backstop.He also stated that a no-deal scenario was “still better than a bad deal,” adding: “As far as we are concerned the withdrawal agreement is the worst position of all.”TUV leader Jim Allister said no unionist should be prepared to countenance the backstop “for even a single day,” adding: “It is not about the duration, it is about sovereignty and there is no room for compromise when it comes to sovereignty.“Once you accept the principle of the backstop, you have accepted the principle that NI should be treated dferently from the rest of the UK.”Irish premier Leo Varadkar yesterday said his government and the EU are happy to offer clarications and assurances on the withdrawal agreement, to help get the accord over the line.The attorney general and Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay are toto Brussels today for further talks.• Morning View: DUP reaction to backstop will be central to fate of UKJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"broken down vehicle causing delays on m  ","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+           TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat s News News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Broken down vehicle causing delays on MTrafficGemma MurrayEmail Published::Tuesday  March Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringSign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Local\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .htmlThanks,  + email +  has been added to our newsletter..

theres no scrutiny, no democratic accountability - when is that going to change \"Northern Irish Secretary Karen Bradley said she would not be moving to direct rule.She said: \"We are in a very unsatisfactory position and I would rather we were not doing this this way.\"But in order to ensure public services continue to be delivered and in order to ensure civil servants in Northern Ireland do have the statutory underpinning they need for the spending, that is why we are taking this budget Bill.\"DUP MP Gavin Robinsonsaid there was \"no need\" for an emergency Bill, asking \"when in the last two months has there been any genuine prospect of the Assembly being restored\" to necessitate the Bill being fast-tracked.Ms Bradley responded: \"We have to be aware of the constitutional precedents that are set by changing the way we scrutinise these Bills...\"What I want to see is those politicians in Northern Ireland doing the right thing, coming back into Stormont, forming the executive so that all of those proper processes can be applied.\"But I dont think we should kid ourselves there is some sort of substitute arrangement that is going to offer a dferent approach - we have to see devolved government restored in Stormont.\"Jay Donnelly sex picture ‘still in possession of others’Broken down vehicle causing delays on M Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Ms Bradley admitted that budgets being set from Westminster would lead to \"perverse outcomes\" for the people of Northern Ireland after a Labour MP raised the issue of childcare.Jess Phillipssaid she had recently been to visit and was \"shocked\" to find out free childcare was not available, and there was nothing in the bill allocated to spend in that area.Ms Bradley said the allocations \"are in line with the advice from the Permanent Secretaries as to the monies they need\".But she added: \"That leads to perverse outcomes, that leads to things not being as we would like them in Northern Ireland.\"It leads to dferences in Northern Ireland, it leads to the end of programmes that we may otherwise have wanted to see continue, but without a minister to direct that, those programmes do finish.\"She said the answer is \"devolved government in Northern Ireland\", adding \"there is no alternatives\".The DUPs Mrs Little-Pengelly also raised the issue of a lack of money for childcare, saying the planned rollout of the Governments flagship  hours of free care policy had stalled without the Assembly sitting.She said: \"There cannot be a decision on  hours free childcare, despite all of the work in the department, because there is no minister there to take it.\"Shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland Tony Lloyd said he did not want to see direct rule, adding: \"We simply cant allow this vacuum to continue in this way, decisions are not being made.\"He said the \"hope is in a restoration of the Stormont structures becausewe give up on that were giving up actually on at least the principle of what the Good Friday agreement delivered\".Mr Lloyd said: \"Weve got to see a lot more concerted effort to get people round the table to try to break that log jam.\"If we start waving the spectre of direct rule at this point then we are saying that were giving up on power-sharing.\"He added: \"Of course the Labour Government did bring in direct rule so none of us can say this can never happen, what I will say though is were not there yet but we are in the position where weve got to see greater activity from the secretary of state, yes of course from the leaders of the political parties.\"I do honestly doubt this Governments capacity ... iIf the Prime Minister herself is only so preoccupied with Brexit that she has no time to look at devolution to Northern Ireland that is a fundamental political mistake that we will come to rue for time to come.\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things N.I. people do better than the English, Scottish and WelshRoad reopens after collisionMomo contacts N.I. man -

The backstop is part of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for re-negotiation.\"And French President Emmanuel Macron also said the agreement was \"not re-negotiable\", in comments just moments before MPs voted.The Commons approved a cross-party amendment, tabled by Midlands MPs Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, rejecting a no-deal Brexit by  to .The vote is not legally binding on the government but will impose massive political pressure on the prime minister to delay Brexit from its scheduled date of March she cannot secure a new deal from Brussels.The PM told MPs: \"I agree that we should not leave without a deal.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cctv.jpg","title":"from cctv to gdpr the people keeping your business safe","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Ulster Business examines an ever-changing approach to business security and what companies are turning to in an increasingly digital age Is Big Brother watching you  For many, the idea of a society peppered with cameras and other forms of security harks back to the view of a dystopian Orwellian society. But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland. Newtownabbey firm Environmental Street Furniturehas announced the acquisition of Co Down based specialist perimeter security company, Sentry Posts. Sentry Posts is a supplier of bollard systems, perimeter security and traffic products in Ireland. Since establishing in , the company has partnered with ATG Access, supplying prestigious projects including Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, Wellington Arch in London, as well as the Europa Hotel and Charles Hurst and Trust Ford dealerships in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\".
