the last step in the PM\u0027s roadmap - will be able to go ahead as planned. Bolton in Greater Manchester recorded 451 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 20 May, the highest in England.The number of people in hospital with coronavirus in Bolton has more than tripled in a fortnight as the Manchester borough grapples with an outbreak of the highly-infectious Indian variant.Sources say there are currently 43 Covid patients in the town\u0027s NHS trust, compared to 12 that were receiving care on May 10.Experts fear the pressure on the trust, which looks after the Royal Bolton Hospital, will only get worse as the infection rate climbs. Bolton is recording more than 400 Covid cases per 100,000 people -  twenty times the national average - following a period of exponential growth of the Indian variant in the last month. It takes several weeks for cases to turn into hospitalisations due to the lag between someone catching and falling seriously ill with Covid.However, Number 10 has said the \u0027majority\u0027 of people being hospitalised with the disease currently are either unvaccinated or have not been for both jabs.Analysis by Public Health England has found two doses of AstraZeneca or Pfizer\u0027s jab provide a similar level of protection from the Indian variant as they do for the Kent version, which has raised hopes that hospital and death rates will not reach the peaks of previous waves.  Meanwhile, data published this week showed the Indian variant spiralling in Bolton is now dominant in nearly 15 per cent of authorities in England – almost twice as many as the previous week.Analysis of samples from people infected with Covid in the week up to May 15 also shows that the B.1.617.2 strain had spread to 151 out of England\u0027s 314 local authorities.The mutant virus had overtaken the previously-dominant Kent variant in 44 places, up from 23 the week prior.It is now behind behind 90 per cent of Covid infections in Blackburn and eight in ten in the hotspots of Bolton, Sefton, Bedford and Croydon.The places where the Indian strain overtook the Kent variant in the most recent week were: Ribble Valley, Preston, Fylde, Burnley, Rossendale, Chorley, Central Bedfordshire, East Northamptonshire, North Hertfordshire, East Hertfordshire, West Oxfordshire, South Oxfordshire, Bristol, Swindon, Wiltshire, Test Valley, Reading, Woking, Slough, Havering, Barking and Dagenham, Barnet, Ealing.It is still dominant in: Bolton, Blackburn with Darwen, Sefton, West Lancashire, Stevenage, Nottingham, South Northamptonshire, Bedford, Chelmsford, Dartford, Sevenoaks, Canterbury, Rushmoor, Hart, Hillingdon, Camden, Hounslow, Greenwich, Croydon and Bromley. But it is no longer the dominant strain in Oadby and Wigston, Broxbourne and Brent which may be down to very low case numbers in these areas. Bolton has the highest infection rate out of local authorities suffering outbreaks of the Indian variant (434 cases per 100,000 people) which has more than doubled over the past week. Data suggests that two per cent of people in one neighbourhood of the borough tested positive for the virus last week.Blackburn with Darwen had the second largest outbreak (215.1), and Bedford had the third largest (142.5).They were followed by new hotspots Burnley (60.7), Rossendale (57.4), Chorley (55.8) and Preston (48.9).Indian variant hotspot Hounslow had the highest Covid infection rate in London (47.5). It was followed by Hillingdon (39.1) and Ealing (35.7).  For comparison, England\u0027s average is 21.3 per 100,000 and has remained around this level since mid-April. PHE\u0027s latest breakdown shows 46.2 per cent of Covid cases were the Kent variant in the week to May 10, but 53.8 per cent were down to other variants. It is thought the first majority were B.1.617.2.  Because the vaccines were shown to be highly effective at stopping people falling ill with Covid in the first place, PHE said they are likely to be even better at preventing hospitalisation and deaths.Hospitalisations and deaths across the UK are at their lowest levels since the crisis began, with just six fatalities a day and fewer than 100 hospital admissions, on average. For comparison, around 1,300 deaths were occurring every day at the peak of the second wave in January.However, the number of infected patients occupying beds at the major NHS trust in Bolton — one of the country\u0027s hotspots for the Indian variant — has continued to creep up over the past week.There is no proof the Indian variant is more lethal than older strains of the coronavirus but data shows it is more transmissible than the Kent type, which triggered Britain\u0027s devastating second wave before vaccines were rolled out. Experts believe B.1.617.2 is 30 per cent more infectious than B.1.1.7 — the name for the Kent strain — but won\u0027t get any concrete data for at least another week.Ministers urged to clarify travel advice for England’s Covid hotspots | Coronavirus | The Guardian(COVID-19) Coronavirus restrictions: what you can and cannot do - GOV.UK"},{"url":null,"title":"Dognappers owners abandon pets lockdown face tougher sentences","story":"Share this articleBoris Johnson threatens tougher sentences for dog theft | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"THREE QUARTERS voters believe Dominic Cummings trusted honest Covid","story":"Share this article        Another damaging barb is likely to be claiming that Mr Johnson wanted to go and seen the Queen in person on March 18 - again something that No10 denies.However, ministers have been frantically trying to blunt the attack from Mr Cummings, with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps dismissing the session as a \u0027sideshow\u0027 and suggesting he has his \u0027own agenda\u0027.Meanwhile, leaked WhatsApps reportedly show that Mr Cummings told politicians to deny that there was a \u0027herd immunity\u0027 strategy at the start of the pandemic - something he now says was the case until just 10 days before the first lockdown.Mr Cummings is expected to be accused by Tory MPs of using today\u0027s appearance before a select committee to \u0027avenge\u0027 his sacking in November after he lost a power struggle with Ms Symonds.But Labour will seize on the claims as evidence that Mr Johnson could have done more to save lives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08df5d6077dc3fe121575c9d1838a729bd221db9/0_319_6541_3925/master/6541.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b40424f68447d2d9a051d4a689f32e8f","title":"embrace the process why no pressure learning is more fun and effective","story":"It hadn’t occurred to me to think about monetising my new hobby, and my answer was swift: “This is just for fun.” While painting as a hobby, I didn’t have to worry if the end results featured eyes that were too far apart, or badly proportioned paws. But the pressure of being paid for my efforts would suck all the joy out of the endeavour. I’d have to actually be good at it, and where’s the fun in that? “Psychology studies have found, at least in experimental settings, that when iniduals have something they’re passionate about and then attach a monetary reward to it, they often become less motivated to do it,” says Shannon Odell, neuroscience doctor of philosophy, who shares her expertise with her 35.6k followers on her TikTok page, @shannon.phd. “You’d think the potential payout would be more motivating, but something about attaching money to practices we normally do out of passion or interest changes our mindset. It’s OK to do something just because you love it.” It’s not just the aim of earning money that could quash your passions when you’re trying out a new pastime or skill. Aspiring to a high standard and setting lofty goals can also dampen the experience. Depending on your mindset and approach, setting goals for yourself could put you at risk of failure and crush your creativity – especially if you’re looking for fast results and set yourself unrealistic targets. “Depending on what you’re trying to learn, having a goal can be motivational – but it can also increase the pressure and, paradoxically, make it harder to succeed,” says Dr Melissa Shepard, psychiatrist and therapist, whose lessons on everything from procrastination to perfectionism have earned her almost a million followers on TikTok. “Sometimes, the most helpful thing you can do is let go of the end goal and just embrace the process of learning and growing. Enjoying what you’re learning might not always increase your ability to understand and remember new material, but it does make it easier to spend the time required to master it.” If you’re the kind of learner who finds it hard to feel motivated without an endgame in mind, it helps to adjust your expectations rather than ignore your goals altogether. For example, if you’d love to learn a new language, removing the time pressure (“I want to be fluent by spring!”), might lead you to enjoy the journey more. “My philosophy on being productive when learning something new is to trust in the timing rather than to set deadlines,” says Katie Volant, productivity and mindset coach. “After working with a time-goal-orientated coach myself, I ended up being burnt out, and I felt like I’d failed because I didn’t achieve my ‘goal’ within the timeframe that was set. “When we’re learning something new, how can we know how long it’s going to take? Instead of focusing on time, trusting that with patience and practice we’ll get to where we want to be makes the journey much more peaceful. If we’re constantly striving for the next goal or milestone, we forget to enjoy the process.” Follow the #LearnOnTikTok hashtag and you’ll find a wealth of expertise – from scientists and horticulturalists to jugglers and chefs, keen to educate users. When it comes to painting, I’ve found that TikTok is the perfect place to go if I’m struggling to get a puppy’s eyes just right, for example – the app’s 60-second lessons can often offer exactly the right motivation you need to learn something new. “Learning through TikTok can be a great way to encourage people to learn for learning’s sake, simply because it presents the information in fun, no-pressure, bite-size pieces,” says Shepard. “We can learn better when we enjoy learning, because enjoyment motivates us to e deeper and improves our concentration.” She notes that one of the core human needs, as postulated by psychologist Abraham Maslow, is self-actualisation: “Growth and development are huge parts of self-actualisation, and in order to grow and develop, we need to learn. So, essentially, learning for learning’s sake is a huge part of life satisfaction and happiness.” So if you’re daunted by the mountain of the goal you’ve set yourself, it might be time to turn your back on it altogether – and start enjoying seeing what uncharted territory you find yourself exploring instead. "},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown is lifting could tiktok help you re learn how to socialise","story":"The reality was, as much as I longed to see my friends and my family, the thought of getting back out there was a daunting prospect. Feelings of self-doubt and a sudden lack of confidence consumed me. Like many people, I’ve been wondering how to actually socialise again. My anxiety levels have skyrocketed. Lockdown has played tricks with my ego and confidence. The question has been what to do about it. As a busy mum-of-three, I don’t exactly have bags of spare time. During lockdown I’d become intrigued by TikTok. I’d looked at some of the uplifting videos that had gone viral and grabbed the whole world’s attention. But I sensed there was more to TikTok than just dance fads. Could its wealth of videos about every subject under the sun help me regain my social skills and self-confidence? I start my exploration of motivational TikTok videos by granting myself permission for some basic “me time”. Given my hectic schedule, I’ve never really been one for so-called “me time” – but watching and listening to some everyday women with little sprinklings of genius on TikTok really made me stop and think: hold on, it is actually about me. “You can’t give to your family from an empty cup,” explains TikTok creator @ivanarichey – one of her many short and snappy pearls of wisdom. I scoffed at it at first, and thought what a cliche. But then I realised that, actually, if I go down, then pretty much the whole ship goes down too. From then on, whenever I could grab five minutes in between the school run and dinnertime, I’d have a quick browse at some other motivational accounts to give me that extra perk I needed to make it through to bedtime. “Compliment yourself, praise yourself,” says TikTok creator @spencer.barbosa, whose motivational gems and quick and quirky style tips will perk you up in an instant. Another of her quotes that I loved was: “You don’t have to be the best, just be the best version of yourself.” I don’t know what it was that made me more receptive to heeding advice in this format. It could have been the sincerity and authenticity of the TikTok creators themselves. It could have been their uplifting vibe or disarming humour. Or it could have been the snappy, no-nonsense format. But pretty soon, I was hooked. I honestly hadn’t actually realised until now just how important and effective it is to consciously lift yourself up, dust off that crown, and so on. Suddenly, the prospect of seeing my friends and socialising again after nearly 18 months didn’t seem so daunting. One of the things I used to love doing before lockdown was get a makeover in the lead-up to a glam event. Given that this has not been an option for quite some time, I wondered if I’d ever be glam again and didn’t want to shock people when they saw me in person. I realised I was a far cry from my filtered image on social media. So I started scrolling for quick makeovers for those of us with not much time to spare. And @thepatriciabright was just the tonic I needed to give me the lift to get my face back on and get back out there. Her videos were great for providing seemingly instant glam, and they were so funny, too – especially when she teamed up with her hubby for a parody clip. It’s amazing what a sprinkling of gold dust over your cheekbones can do. And makeup artist @dominiqueallison taught me some awesome mum tricks to hide those bags by putting a slick of concealer on over your foundation. She also whipped up some funky retro looks for when we are allowed to go #outout again. I’m also a big fan of videos posted by @jaimykoroma and @werejagreeneyes, which had me in hysterics with her life hacks in ultra-short, 10-second videos. A change was coming and it didn’t have to be scary. Something remarkable was happening. Thanks to TikTok, I realised I could love life – and myself – after lockdown. "},{"url":null,"title":"from using unexpected tools to practical prepping advice how to nail diy with tiktok","story":"As a man of cineastic pretences, I own a projector – or a “big telly” as I like to call it – but since moving, it’s been languishing in a box. Spending as much time indoors as we all have lately, setting it up is something that would improve my life immeasurably. A competent friend of mine helped me get the projector up in my last place. But between lockdowns and just plain asking too many DIY-related favours from the poor guy, I realised if I wanted to put something up on the wall, I was very much on my own. So I did what all humans do in times of need: I turned to the internet. Being an older millennial, I’d assumed that TikTok was beyond me. It’s the place where young people mime to music, right? Could the TikTok community really help? I have to confess, I was sceptical. To test the water, I decided to see what help I could get for putting up a picture – using hashtags to search TikTok for relevant videos. The picture I sought to hang is a wonderful illustration of my beloved cat Itzi, to serve as a constant reminder of who’s boss in the house. So it wasn’t something I wanted to mess up. To start with, I find a top tip from Kim, a home decor blogger who posts TikTok videos under the handle @clippercityhouse. She suggests filming myself holding a picture at different heights to decide on where I should place it. This is a great idea if you’re working on your own – as I was.I put the hook in the wall, and move on to the fiddly part of trying to get the hanging wire over. After struggling for a bit, @goodleyearth comes to the rescue with his tip to use an unexpected item of cutlery. Under calm tutelage, I place a fork upright on the nail and use it as a guide to get the picture on – I get it right the first time. Now this is the stuff I’m here for! I discover that DIY videos on TikTok are like having access to countless experts sharing learned knowledge, saving hours of misery, frustration and unnecessary holes in the wall. No more skipping through long, painful videos trying to find the relevant 30 seconds. After some nervous tea drinking, the picture of Itzi remains vertical. And so bolstered with caffeine and perhaps too much confidence, I set my sights on the shelf for my projector. After a quick search, I find that @haizzly has a useful video about prepping and priming wood. Soon the board is sanded, primed, sanded again, painted (is it starting to sound like I know what I’m doing yet?) and left to dry overnight. Woodshop Diaries – under the handle @woodshopdiaries – shows me how to drill wood without splitting, and even takes me through the basics of how a drill works in a cheerful and straightforward way. While it’s not necessarily essential for this particular task, it was a nice touch I really appreciated. And @constructiontips proves to be a treasure trove of, well, construction tips. Most of them are for tasks far above even my most lofty ambitions – however, there is a nifty trick I can see myself using in the future. It’s actually intended for picture hanging, but works well enough for a small shelf. Using tape and cardboard, I mark the drill points and have a template of where to drill the wall. Minimal fuss and no scrawling. Next, I check out @mcp_thats_me, who gives a brilliantly efficient overview of getting screws in the wall. Once this is done, I’m finally able to mount the shelf. The other useful thing about these TikTok tutorials is that they play on a loop, which is particularly handy if your hands are covered in paint, or you’re holding something heavy.A few days later, the shelf is still standing, the projector is working as it should and the wall is looking more interesting than it has in a long time. As I sit, I start to think about other projects that could now be possible. Revarnishing a coffee table? My previous doubts abated, I fire up TikTok to find out.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe spread of infection from a Covid-19 case in a shop worker in the midlands led to a further 54 people becoming infected, mostly due to a family gathering.The Department of Public Health in HSE Midlands found in a new case study of linked cases that the social gathering attended by a person infected by the shop worker led to a further 43 Covid-19 cases.The web of contagion from the initial “index case” in the shop, recorded in April and May, spread to 12 families, 15 households, a food takeaway, a secondary school and a creche.Nine people were directly infected by a shop worker attending the extended family gathering.One person who attended the party infected five co-workers in a food takeaway from where the virus spread to four other households and the creche, where four people were infected.TransmissionThree infected people in the creche spread the virus to six other people in their families.The case study by public health doctors in the midlands shows how onward transmission can spread the virus into different settings from close contacts.The transmission across the 55 cases involved the virus spreading through “seven generations” as it passed from person to person.“This is a possible picture that could be reproduced at any time again in the coming weeks,” said Dr Una Fallon, director of public health in HSE Midlands.She warned that increased mixing as further restrictions are lifted could lead to similar spreads of transmission and that unvaccinated young people could still be hospitalised if infected.“We do worry that a level of complacency has set in because things have opened up that people think it is all over. It is not over. We are not stood down from investigating,” she said.She said public health doctors have been encountering difficulties advising close contacts of cases because people thought they were hoax calls connected to the cyberattack on the HSE.“That has been an issue,” she said. “I think with the cyberattack people may fear that we are a hoax. We are not a hoax. We will ring you and we will do our best to prove who we are.”Extra cautionDr Fallon said non-essential businesses reopening for the first time this year should prepare for a phone call from public health and to share lists of close contacts, if they have a case and that any close contacts or infected people should expect to have to isolate at home for 14 days.She urged young people and their families not to attend graduation or end-of-academic year parties or stand in collective school photographs or to participate in study groups.Leaving Cert students, along with family and friends, should show extra caution as the time was approaching where they could be prevented from sitting their exams from June 9th if they are named as a close contact of a case testing positive for the first time in a day 10 test, she said.“The group that needs protection are Leaving Cert students who want to sit exams,” she said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"edwin poots says north south relations have never been worse","story":"The incoming DUP leader Edwin Poots was answering questions in the Assembly on Tuesday in his capacity as the North’s Minister for Agriculture. Photograph: PAThe incoming DUP leader has claimed in the Stormont Assembly that North-South relations have “never been worse”.He was answering questions in the Assembly on Tuesday in his capacity as the North’s Minister for Agriculture.“As a consequence of that every home is being damaged, and on the Executive’s papers . . . in every area of health, in medical devices and medicines we are in the red zone, that is a zone that we have been put there as a result of the protocol which was driven very heavily by the former taoiseach and tánaiste,” Mr Poots claimed.Reassurances“So Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland relations are very bad and they need to be fixed, but we need to get some reassurances that we’re going to get something considerably better than we currently are in terms of protocol to fix those relations.”The North’s Minister for Agriculture, Nichola Mallon, said on Tuesday that she had sought legal advice over the DUP’s boycott of some North-South Ministerial Council meetings as part of its campaign against the Northern Ireland protocol.Unionists are opposed to the protocol because it places a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea, and Mr Poots has pledged that as DUP leader he will take a tougher stance against the protocol.The absence of the DUP has meant that some of the council’s meetings have been unable to take place.“I understand the DUP are having new leadership but, regardless of who the leader is, they have legal responsibilities and I am so concerned by this matter that I have sought legal advice from the attorney general on this particular issue,” Ms Mallon said.Mr Poots was speaking in the Assembly in response to a question from the SDLP Assembly member (MLA) Patsy McGlone, who asked him to “confirm that he would not obstruct any further North-South meetings”.Defend recordThe incoming DUP leader also said he “remained committed to all of my duties as a Minister in this devolved assembly” and went on to defend his record on North-South co-operation, citing his role as a former minister for health in the establishment of a cross-Border radiotherapy service at Altnagelvin hospital in Derry and the agreement that paediatric cardiac patients from the North could receive surgery in Dublin.Asked by the DUP MLA Keith Buchanan for the staffing cost incurred at Northern Ireland’s ports because of the implementation of the protocol, Mr Poots said the figure came to almost £24.5 million (€28.3 million) since June 2020.Meanwhile, the DUP met David Frost, the UK minister responsible for EU relations, on Tuesday and called again for the replacement of the protocol.DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson said there had been a “direct and forthright exchange of views” and they had made clear that the UK government “must act carefully but decisively to restore the delicate balance of community relations in the coming days”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"glenveagh pledges to exclude corporate investors from 1 200 home project in fingal","story":"Glenveagh chief executive Stephen Garvey (above) gave what he described as an ‘irrevocable undertaking’ to ‘not sell any houses or duplexes in the private housing element to institutional investors.’ Photograph: Fennell  Property group Glenveagh has promised to shut out corporate investors from a major north Dublin housing project on public land as part of a deal with Fingal county council that will reserve apartments for private buyers and cost-rental tenants. Glenveagh set out the binding commitments in two letters to the local authority. The move came before councillors voted at a four-hour meeting last night to allow the company build up to 1,200 houses, apartments and duplex homes on a 28-hectare site that Fingal owns at Ballymastone, Donabate. The deal allocates 20 per cent of the project for social housing and 20 per cent for affordable homes, but critics or the original deal had attacked the allocation of 60 per cent for private housing on the basis that public land should not be used for expensive homes beyond the reach of many buyers. The pledge by Glenveagh relates to the private portion of the project, prompting some councillors to say it could lead to institutional investors being excluded from other housing projects on public lands and private apartments being reserved for cost-rental schemes supported by the State.Partnerships“Local authorities all across the country need to provide housing, and the State owns a significant portion of land. They will need to engage in these partnerships with developers and builders,” Ms Power said.She had signed a letter from Green councillors to Fingal this month demanding the exclusion of institutions and more cost-rental homes. “We don’t want to see people being locked out of the property market, and we don’t want to see anything that would contribute to the rental crisis,” she said.“We put forward suggestions of solutions, and I’m pleased that we were listened to.” In a letter on Monday to Fingal, Glenveagh chief executive Stephen Garvey gave what he described as an “irrevocable undertaking” to “not sell any houses or duplexes in the private housing element to institutional investors”. In a second letter on Tuesday, issued hours before councillors met to vote on the project, he provided further “irrevocable” commitments.“In respect of the balance, we will commit to making first offer to the private market.”Matthew McAleese, Fingal director of planning, told the meeting that the undertakings were legally binding. Councillors approved the project by 31 votes to nine, but Sinn Féin and the Social Democrats refused to back it. Ms Power said she would have found it “very difficult” to support the deal without the commitments made by Glenveagh. Paul Mulville, a Social Democrat councillor, who wanted the land agreement with Glenveagh amended to reflect the undertakings, said he did not believe the company. “The serious issue I have is that I just don’t trust a letter from a developer and we’ve seen often in the past promises made by developers gone back on all across the county, all across the country,” he told the meeting. “The only way to ensure this doesn’t happen . . . is to write this into the disposal agreement today and have it written into the development agreement.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 365 new cases of coronavirus reported by the department of health","story":"Of the new cases, 41 are in intensive care.

In Ireland, the green pass is expected to be operated from mid-July, with Minister of State for Communications Ossian Smyth saying it could be rolled out within a week of the legislation being approved by the EU.Mr Martin said the Government would receive advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team on Thursday and agree measures on travel, entertainment, sport and hospitality on Friday. “Covid has . . . really undermined travel for the last year and a bit. A lot of workers want to get back to work, pilots want to get back to work, cabin crews, everybody working on the ground in the airports, we understand that fully.“Connectivity is important for Ireland, so we have to weigh all of this up as we make decisions on Friday, but I just want to let people know in the sector that we’re acutely aware of the pain that they’re going through and have been going through because of Covid-19. The same applies to hospitality, and the entertainment and the arts.“Anything we open, we want to keep open, insofar as we possibly can.”No delayMeanwhile, Mr Smyth denied there will be any delays in the issuing of the digital green pass once it is approved, despite concerns arising from the recent cyberattack on the health service.Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show, Mr Smyth said it was reasonable to speculate that there could be delays because HSE staff were engaged in returning vital systems, however, he said the data involved would come from the vaccination programme which had not been affected by the cyberattack.A pilot programme for a digital cert had been in operation in Ireland since earlier this year, he added, so the pass could be rolled out within a week of the legislation being approved by the EU.The digital cert would be a much more reliable system than what is in place now, with people arriving into Ireland required to present documentary evidence that they had a negative test result, Mr Smyth said. He warned that such documents could be fraudulent as they were issued by private companies and laboratories so it was not always possible to verify their veracity.Mr Smyth said he expected Ireland to be “ahead of the pack” in the rollout of the pass because of the pilot programme: “We will be ready within a week of the EU legislation.”The digital green pass would speed up registration times at airports and would involve a bar code, he said.ControlIf the plans are approved the Government will retain the authority to control the conditions for entry from overseas, and will monitor the containment of the virus and the rate of vaccination before the scheme beginsThe certificates feature a public key that holds no personal data, but confirms that the holder is vaccinated, immune or tested negative.

Photograph: Alan Betson  The The country is in bits over the Leaving Cert.Including people who never imagined they would end up in their later years fretting about the damn thing all over again.So the usual old platitudes won’t wash.“I know the Leaving Cert is very important to you. But, honestly, it’s not the be-all and end-all. In years to come you will look back at this time and wonder what all the worry and stress was about.”That kind of thing.We want our Leaving Certificates and we want them now!The Taoiseach, who wasn’t in the Dáil on Tuesday because he was in some place called “abroad”, seemed quite optimistic about the overall results when asked about the prospects for this year’s cohort in Ireland – the largest ever, with numbers running into the millions and a dangerous rump of mature students waiting to run amok if they fail.“Full steam ahead,” he told reporters in Brussels, indicating that the proposed digital green certificate for travel within EU countries is all set to go. He chose a phrase associated with old boats, but struck an optimistic note nonetheless for people yearning to fly again.Earlier in the day, the junior minister for communications Ossian Smyth was also very upbeat about a full resumption of air travel in Europe, calming jittery Leaving Cert nerves brought on by a newspaper report that the HSE cyberattack had thrown the digital green pass plans into chaos. He told Morning Ireland he expects Ireland to start dishing out the certificates within a week of the EU passing the legislation.‘Chocks away’In the Dáil, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan stood in for the Taoiseach at the first Leaders’ Questions of the week. With summer holidays looming, the Minister for Transport was perfectly placed to yell “chocks away” and start the nation’s propeller.Eamon did his best but his cautious approach left sinking hearts all round.With Micheál Martin and Leo Varadkar otherwise occupied, the third leg of the Coalition stool carefully considered Opposition questions on the lifting of Covid-19 travel restrictions. Anything vaguely contentious was gingerly nudged to one side with the promise he would raise the matter with the Taoiseach andor “the relevant experts”.The digital pass wasn’t mentioned until the House got around to hearing statements on the aviation industry in a session dominated by TDs from constituencies in the vicinity of airports.The closest intervention during Leaders’ Questions came from Labour leader Alan Kelly, who spoke on behalf of the 60-to-70 year olds who contacted him worried about their level of protection against the new Indian variant of the Covid-19 virus.This age group was amongst the first to get the jab but will be among the last to be fully vaccinated. The majority of them got the AstraZeneca vaccine and have to wait at least 12 weeks for their second dose. “That’s three months,” Kelly added helpfully.“What is really worrying” is that the latest UK research data shows that the first dose provides only 30 per cent of protection against this powerful new strain. “It means that of all the cohorts vaccinated, this cohort will have the lowest level of protection, the longest waiting time for a follow-up dose and they have the greatest risk of ending up in hospital.”IntervalAcross the water, the interval between doses has been shortened to eight weeks. Could the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) revisit their strategy for treating 60-to-70 year olds in the light of the new research?Eamon Ryan wasn’t going to get involved in recommending any course of action requiring medical expertise. “We constantly have to be vigilant and concerned about what is happening with Covid-19,” he replied to Kelly, who knew that already. What about the AZ first-timers who have “amazed” him by coming forward with their concerns in such big numbers?“I will present the argument to the relevant experts but can’t commit to taking up the advice,” was the Minister’s encouraging response.The 60-to-70 year olds will be thrilled.But he did have some good news for Alan Kelly’s worried seniors. By the time international travel restrictions are lifted, they too should be free to fly off and misbehave in the sunny fleshpots along the Med with the rest of the Leaving Certificate class of 2021.Although, like everyone else, they would prefer to get their Leaving Cert earlier and be able to jet away as soon as possible. Everybody wants to get their hands on that precious certificate – it can be paper or digital – as soon as possible. Get those results through now.Then Eamon Ryan informs the Dáil they mightn’t be through until the middle of August, which put quite a damper on Tuesday’s proceedings.“Given that the digital green certificate might not be in widespread use until at least mid-August, it would not seem reasonable to expect fully vaccinated people to wait for the digital green certificate before allowing freedom from current pre-arrival PCR and quarantine requirements,” he said.At this rate the Government will have to open a special Leaving Cert hotline for the stressed and the Vitamin D deprived.And designate a special number for the increasingly worried and annoyed AztraZeneca people, who they would do well not to ignore.Because it’s highly unlikely that Alan Kelly is the only TD who has been getting grief about the situation."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Politics latest news: Dominic Cummings says BBC\u0026#39s Laura Kuenssberg was \u0026#39my only regular media contact\u0026#39 - watch liveCoronavirus latest news: AstraZeneca \u0026#39never even tried to respect vaccine contract\u0026#39, says EU lawyer - watch PMQs liveDominic Cummings v Boris Johnson: Key points from adviser\u0026#39s attack on GovernmentComment: Cummings\u0026#39s confession shows why we\u0026#39re lucky he\u0026#39s no longer calling the shotsWho is next on the list for Covid vaccines - and how will I be invited to book an appointment?Covid lockdown roadmap: what are the latest rules as restrictions continue to easeDominic Cummings: Matt Hancock should have been sacked for \u0026#3915 to 20\u0026#39 Covid failuresAstrazeneca Covid vaccine Q\u0026ampA: What we know about blood clots, side effects and risks \u0026#39Sixth form notes on a whiteboard?\u0026#39 How the internet reacted to Dominic Cummings\u0026#39s pandemic Plan B Lukashenko says \u0026#39ill-wishers\u0026#39 trying to \u0026#39strangle\u0026#39 Belarus in first comments since plane seizureHillsborough trial collapses as judge rules no case to answer against former police officers May\u0026#39s Super Flower Moon: where to see it tonight and when the next full moons are visible in 2021Comment: The Government is in danger of overshadowing its own stunning vaccine success\u0026#39Who do we not save?\u0026#39: Dominic Cummings reveals scribbled pandemic Plan B \u0026#39from inside No 10\u0026#39Scotland lockdown roadmap: Latest rules and restrictions for Scottish council areasThree people arrested over Italy cable car crash after claim safety brake \u0026#39deactivated\u0026#39Arab states accept sham Syria elections as Assad returns to foldMapped: The hotspots for the Indian variant of Covid-19 in the UKHow the flaws in Dominic Cummings’s Covid strategy have been exposed\u0026#39Dom bombs\u0026#39: What secrets will Cummings spill when he faces MPs today?Summer solstice 2021: everything you need to know about the longest day of the yearBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"farce governments plan new local lockdowns unravels","story":"Ministers failed to pass on the new advice to local health and council leaders, who then told residents they did not have to follow the guidelines.The Government then issued a climbdown, stressing that the guidance had always been optional.“We will be updating the guidance for areas where the new Covid-19 variant is spreading to make it clearer we are not imposing local restrictions,” a government spokesman said.One insider said: “The decision was made and the Department for Health was responsible for informing the local health leaders.”Recriminations were also hurled between the Government and Labour.

Meanwhile several countries with large Syrian refugee populations, including Turkey and Germany, have blocked voting.The vote is taking place in defiance of a 2015 United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a new constitution ahead of elections but a collapsing regional commitment to the resolution has seen increasing numbers of Arab states accept the sham elections as evidence of a genuine political transition.Last month Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry claimed that the vote would allow the Syrian people to “choose their future and form a government that represents them.”States like Egypt may cite the election as reason to readmit Syria to the Arab League, from which it was suspended in November 2011. While sclerotic and functionally irrelevant, Syria’s readmission to the body would symbolise the completion of Assad’s regional rehabilitation, a process that has progressed significantly in the past few years.The United Arab Emirates, which once supported Syrian rebels, reopened its embassy in Damascus in December 2018, followed shortly afterwards by Bahrain. The move reflected growing Arab concern over their diminished role in Syria amid the growing influence of Turkey and Iran.Even Saudi Arabia is making overtures towards Damascus, earlier this month dispatching intelligence chief Gen Khalid Humeidan for the first known meeting with his Syrian counterpart since the start of the war. The regional impact of Syria’s collapsing economy may be driving re-engagement. More than 80 per cent of Syria’s population now live in poverty amid runaway inflation. A recent survey carried out in the capital showed that nearly two in three Damascenes want to emigrate, with the majority citing declining living standards as the biggest factor.Suffering under sanctions and saddled with debt, the government has turned on former regime insiders for shakedowns. Among those targeted is Assad’s cousin Rami Makhlouf, once known as Mr Five Per Cent for the cut he was reputed to take from any new business venture.A new class of warlords, smugglers and racketeers has taken the place of the former business elite. The country now produces so much of the methamphetamine captagon that experts describe Syria as a narco-state.In April, Saudi customs intercepted millions of dollars of captagon hidden in pomegranates arriving from Lebanon, which is a conduit for Syrian drug exports. The find alarmed Saudi officials enough that they banned imports of produce from Lebanon, which is suffering its own economic collapse.While the West continues to oppose the vote, their words will be powerless to halt the process. “A legitimate election can only follow an inclusive and transparent process” – as laid out by the UN Security Council in resolution 2254 – “where all eligible voters can take part, free from intimidation,” said Jonathan Hargreaves, UK Special Representative for Syria.Assad responded to those views on Wednesday by saying that Syria would disregard them. The “value of those opinions is zero,” he said. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brits could take island holidays","story":"NewsBrits could take island holidays evenmainland is on amber list, Top Tory saysTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was desirable for islands with direct flights to be listed separately from the mainland - but warned no decision had been takenmirrorShareCommentsByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY NewsPopular island destinations such as the Canaries could be considered separate from the mainland for holidays \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Grant Shapps confirmed that islands could be looked at separately when the travel green list is updated - raising hopes over popular holiday hotspots such as the Greek Islands, the Canaries and the Balearics. Foreign holidays were allowed again on May  but only a handful of countries such as Portugal made the green list for quarantine free travel. No decisions have been made yet on which countries will feature on the next green list, with an update expected in the first week of June. It comes after ministers sparked travel confusion by giving conflicting advice about whether Brits could take holidays in amber list countries. Thousands of Brits headed out to Spain this week for a sunny break, which will mean that they have to isolate for up to  days when they get home.  But the Government issued warnings that people should not be flying to amber destinations for a holiday - despite it being allowed by law. Askedislands could be opened up to tourists, Mr Shapps said: Thereaposs a dferent between the sort of in principle, the way we want to make this work, and the actual data the Joint Biosecurity Centre are going to come forward to us with. Thataposs information I havenapost see as yet. On the in principle part of this, I have always said of course it is desirable - where an aircraft can fly direct to an island, for example, and that island is therefore accessible in the manner where you donapost have to go via a mainland - that you look at that dferently. Thataposs what we did last year as well. But he said the ability to get data on iants could be a problem on smaller locations. I havenapost had that advice from them yet, he added.  It comes after Aviation Minister Robert Courts said the Government will take an island approach where possible. Independent MP Margaret Ferrier asked transport ministers in a written question whether the traffic-light system would include an island policy to reopen routes to relatively low-risk regions of nations as was implemented in summer . Mr Courts replied: The Government will take an island approach for border measures where possible. Changes to the traffic light country system will be reviewed and implemented every three weeks, unless concerning evidence means we need to act faster to protect public health.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnConservative PartyPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic cummings live evidence mps","story":"NewsDominic Cummings LIVE: Matt Hancock shouldve been fired for criminal behaviour, says ex-aideBoris Johnsons ex-aide Dominic Cummings claims the Prime Minister saw coronavirus as a \"scare story\", Matt Hancock should have been sacked and failures led to unnecessary deathsmirrorShareByChris KitchingSenior News ReporterUpdated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video watch-live-dominic-cummings-gives-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:ffFWd,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

In his hearing, Mr Cummings the described chaos in Downing Street in the days leading up to the first Covid lockdown. He at one point compared the situation to a scene from Independence Day - the  disaster movie. Mr Cummings said that on the evening of March  - when the whiteboard was supposedly filled in - it was realised that a meeting would need to be held with Mr Johnson to explain weaposre going to have to ditch the whole official plan, weaposre heading for the biggest disaster this country has seen since . He said the second most powerful official in the country at the time, Helen MacNamara, who was Deputy Cabinet Secretary, walked into the room and said: Iaposve just been talking to the official Mark Sweeney who is in charge of co-ordinating with the Department of Health. He said, quote, aposIaposve been told for years that there was a whole plan for this. There is no plan. Weaposre in huge troubleapos. Mr Cummings said she told him: I think we are absolutely f*****, I think this country is headed for disaster, I think weaposre going to kill thousands of people.  Mr Cummings said he told her: I think youaposre right. I think it is a disaster. He said that on March , the Prime Minister was told: You are going to have to lock down. But Mr Cummings added: But there is no lockdown plan. Sage havenapost modelled it, DH donapost have a plan, we are going to have to figure out and hack together a lockdown plan.

He took the Prime Minister through all the graphs, and through the NHS graphs, and showed him that the system is thinking this is all weeks and weeks and away... but this is all completely wrong... The NHS is going to be smashed in weeks. Mr Cummings said it was a huge failure on his own part that he did not push harder for an earlier lockdown.

While her job is far from glamorous, what she does makes a huge dference to the lives of the people she helps - many of whom have mental health issues. The -year-old, from Frome, Somerset, who runs Goddess Organising, is known for her spotless homes and meticulous organisational skills and is called in to overhaul master bedrooms, kitchens and garages - but sheaposs also been asked to tackle teenagersapos messy bedrooms. She said: “Ninety percent of my clients admit to having postnatal depression, ADHD or mental health problems, anxiety or stress, and that’s why their homes are the way they are, because they can’t face tidying it, while copying with kids, work and stress, then it becomes so big, that it’s too overwhelming.  “What I do isn’t a luxury - it’s a necessity for people. People want others to say it’s OK, you’ve got this disorder, so don’t be ashamed of it. It’s an emergency service, it’s for people who really need it to make themselves feel better. “I also work with self-employed people who are too busy to worry about how messy the garage is, full-time working single parents who are struggling to juggle work, kids and le, and many others. “People often feel embarrassed they need to hire an organiser. That’s why I post before and after pictures, to show people they’re not alone. “I offer decluttering tips and le hacks to help clients keep their homes organised, clutter-free and a peaceful haven for them and their families. “Every story is dferent. There are people whose homes have just run away from them and they need me to come in and press the reset button. “Hoarding is the obsessive need to hang onto things because you’re worried that you may need it one day.” Chloe shares some of her most impressive before and after photos to show potential customers who may be embarrassed to ask for help that they are not alone. Chloe started her business three years as she needed to make some extra cash but wanted a job that would fit around her young son.  Now, her prices start at £ a day depending on the job. She said: “I do come up against a lot of mouldy food, huge dust balls like you wouldn’t believe, dead rodents and funnily enough sex toys. Chloe says her job is all about clearing out the rubbish to make room for the loved, used and needed. “Once a room is decluttered, I can be left to organise it into a more logical fashion.  “I will deep clean each area ready for the new items to find their permanent homes. And then it’s onto the fun bit, the unveiling of the room to the client. This is usually where I get cried on! “I have been described as a whirlwind, superwoman and the obvious one, a true goddess.” The super-organiser says although she doesn’t have counselling training, her clients confide in her, so she helps them to process their feelings and encourages them to say goodbye to some beloved items.  Chloe added: “For most people, being locked down in homes that suppressed them and increased their already stressed minds became the tipping point.” Soon Chloe’s clients started sharing their stories of how she changed their homes and mentally lted a huge weight of their shoulders. Chloe said: “On our initial contact, my customers are shy, withdrawn and apologetic. They feel the need to justy why they need my help. “We all need help with something in our lives after all. I also get cried on a lot.  “Having a stranger arrive who won’t judge, who is solely there to help and promises to make everything go away, tends to open the flood gates of desperation, relief and gratitude. “So many clients cry when I say it is doable. For them to know that someone is going to come in and take over is massive. “To know that tomorrow all the clutter will be gone and left in a more logical and clean organised way is le changing.”  But Chloe says her decluttering plan only worksthe client is completely on board with the process. She explains: “Most average size and cluttered rooms take a day to do. I do have one client whose house may take the rest of the year. “So far, each bedroom has taken two-and-a-half days to complete - and the entire large three-bedroom house is filled with stuff. “I usually have the clients work alongside me as I need them to have an input in the decision making of what stays and what goes. “By touching each item they either feel emotions or they don’t and they soon recognise the items that mean a lot to them and the ones that are just clutter. “The physical and mental energy that is involved in a day’s decluttering is exhausting for all so the idea of having to do this again is off putting enough not to creep stuff back to their lives.” But one of the most important parts of Chloe’s home overhauls is talking to clients about the importance of changing their mindset, so they do not slip back into old habits.

He said: “Before I even left the house, I was sweating, I was in fight or flight mode. Panic attacks, severe anxiety.  to  was a nightmare for me. I was freaking out every single time I got in a car and every single time I saw a camera.” He added: “Everywhere I go, every time I meet someone, it’s almost like I’m being drained of this energy, picking up on somebody ’s emotion.Chelsy was constantly questioned about her relationship with Harry, and at the time was juggling a career in leverage law, which she found exhausting with “back-to-back deals, working till am, conference calls at eight”, reports the . Pictures of her exiting nightclubs ended up splashed in the newspapers when she did have time to socialise with friends, and this, along with the stress of dating a royal, contributed to the relationship ending. “I like to enjoy le, but I like to achieve things and am very ambitious, Chelsy said. “They can be forgiven for not knowing I was working really hard, I didnapost shout about it. “If you go out once, they take a picture, but they don’t take a picture of you going to work every morning, it’s of you falling out of a nightclub at am.” Harry knew how much the press were affecting his then-girlfriend.  “I can see how upset she get, he said in an interview for his st birthday. “My girlfriend is somebody who’s very special to me, and yes, she’s gone through some very hard times.”Chelsy, who is reportedly still friends with Prince Harry, attended his wedding to Meghan Markle, and had attended Prince William and Kate’s wedding in , reportedly realising at the event she had made the right decision to end the relationship.Katie Nicholl wrote in her biography ‘Harry: Le, Loss and Love’ that the wedding “made Chelsy’s mind up once and for all”. She added: “The le of a royal bride was not for her and she told Harry she could never make the sacrices Kate had made.” In the Apple TV+ documentary, the Duke of Sussex revealed he suffered panic attacks and descended into binge drinking and drugs while battling feelings of being unable to save his mother Prince Diana. Harry tells how he first tried to seek help for his mental health in his s after years of pain before finally committing to therapy when he met we Meghan Markle five years ago.The Duke said of emotional turmoil in his childhood and s: “I wasn’t in an environment where it was encouraged to talk about it either, that was sort of, like, squashed.” The Me You Can’t See is now available to stream on Apple TV+.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMeghan MarklePrince HarryOprah WinfreyAppleApple TVRoyal FamilyMental health"},{"url":null,"title":"couple trapped mouldy home damp","story":"NewsCouple trapped in mouldy home so damp they couldnt breathe in their living roomAmy Little and partner George Curtis, from Hull, said their home was so damp it was \"destroying our lungs\" but the landlords allegedly failed to help despite repeated pleas over three yearsmirrorShareCommentsByKirstin Tait:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsAmy Little and her partner George Curtis said they felt trapped in a home full of damp \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Amy Little and her partner George Curtis had been living in a two-bedroom house in Hull which they claim was full of damp.They claim the issues started right when they first moved into the property in Gladys Villas on Brecon Street, as they noticed the wall was dripping with water after one month, HullLive reports. The desperate couple, who couldnapost afford to move out as they were unemployed for mental health reasons, said the property was affecting our health and destroying our lungs.Have you had an experience of the sort  Let us know at webnews@mirrorDespite them constantly explaining the issues to landlords at Wardbright Properties over the span of three years, the couple claimed the firm didnapost do anything about it. Amy, , said: “It was right from the start, we had only been there for a month and the wall was dripping with water and the paper was crumbling away. There was a massive wet patch and they were blaming us and saying we weren’t putting the heating on and not opening windows enough but we were doing that. We were ventilating the property and we were putting the heating on when it was cold. “It was horrendous, it was really affecting our health to the point that we couldnapost even sit in our own living room because it wasnapost breathable. It severely affected our mental health and meant we avoided being in the property unless we had nowhere  to go - we couldnapost breathe properly.  My partner’s asthma got a lot worse and he had to take his inhaler a lot more than he would normally. It was destroying the property, the walls, the furniture, photos and belongings from people I’ve lost – it was just unliveable. The couple claim thgat they reported the issues to landlords but their concerns went unheard, and when they did react, they would complete botch job repairs. Amy said that after partner Curtis, , got a job as a telesales advisor, the couple were able to afford to leave.  However, they were shocked to find out that Wardbright Properties charged their guarantor £,. to repair damages caused by the damp - for which they are now seeking legal advice. They charged us for a full clean of the house which we refused to do because of how awful the property was, she said. We refused to paint over the damp as we didnapost want to be part of their lie where they cover the damp rather than sort it out because itaposs cheaper to do. They also took money for contribution for re-decoration and other things in the house which were ruined due to the damp which we feel was fairly unfair as the only reason the property was in such a state was due to their severe lack of repairs. You can tell how horrendous the other place was because where we are now, we havenapost changed the way we live - we put our heating on just as much and open our windows just as much as we did before. We’ve been here for two months and we have had no problems, nothing has been destroyed, it’s just been completely dferent. The Mirror has contacted Wardbright Properties but they have declined to comment.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMental healthHousing"},{"url":null,"title":"first picture couple pulled rubble","story":"NewsFirst picture of couple pulled from rubble after gas explosion kills toddlerSharon and Darren Greenham survived the Heysham explosion that killed two-year-old neighbour George Hinds, as detectives open a criminal probe after finding a cut pipe caused the blastmirrorShareCommentsByTalia ShadwellReporter:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video young-child-killed-devastating-explosion-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:LzQuMRlL,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Sharon and Darren Greenham were badly wounded in the blast that killed two-year-old George Hinds. Parents Vicky Studholme, , and Stephen Hinds, , also survived the blast at their Heysham, Lancashire home in the early hours of May  that cost their beloved sonaposs le. A childaposs toy covered in debris was seen lying amid the wrecked homesapos rubble after the two couples were pulled from the ruins. George’s heartbroken father has reportedly posted a filmed tribute on Facebook of his son reading a book about animals, next to the caption: “My little boy”.Lancashire Police have opened a criminal probe int the case after officers identied the cause of the explosion as a cut gas pipe.  Firefighters, police and paramedics scrambled to Mallowdale Avenue at around .am after residents were woken by the sound of a blast. Two homes completely collapsed as a result of the explosion, while another was seriously damaged. George’s parents were also injured and rushed to hospital but have since been discharged and are recovering as they reel from the loss of their boy. Stephen posted a heartfelt tribute to his little boy on Facebook, according to The Sun.He wrote: “Words can’t describe what the last week has done to me and Vicki. “The tears haven’t stopped. At .am Sunday morning my little boy was pronounced dead after two hours  minutes trying to bring him back. “Nothing I can say or do will bring him back, I really wish I could. Why didn’t it happen to me and keep him playing here with his mum   “Every day this week has been a new challenge and to go from seeing my two-year-old beautul boy from playing in the garden, to a week later planning his funeral in his new ft bed, is unreal. “Please everyone don’t take le for granted and look after your kids and yourselves. I really mean that. “My little angel George sleep tight son, mummy and daddy is with you always. Love you so so so so much x.”  Two other people – a man aged  and a woman aged  - were taken to hospital with injuries described as critical following the blast. Detectives, assisted by gas experts, have been carrying out a fingertip search of the scene following the explosion. They say they now identied the cause of the explosion as a gas pipe which had been cut inside the home. Enquiries are ongoing into how and why the pipe came to be severed, investigators said this week.  Detective Chief Inspector Jane Webb, of the Force Major Investigation Team, said: “My thoughts first and foremost remain with George’s family and loved ones at this time, as well as those others affected by this incident. “An incredible amount of work has been done at the scene in a relatively short space of time and as well as identying the source of the explosion we have also managed to recover some items of George’s, which I know means a lot to his parents.  “Our focus now is on trying to establish how and why the pipe inside No.  came to be cut and those enquiries are complex and y. “I would like to thank the community for their help so far and I want to continue to appeal to anyone who may have information which could assist our investigation to come forward and contact us.

Also for the heart of our nation to be a beacon of hope. I’m with them,  per cent. In the past  months we’ve seen black people empowered to have conversations that they didn’t feel able to beforehand. The wave of anger moved the dial from: ’Is there structural racism ’ to ‘We know it is there and we are ready to challenge it.’ What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  So many of the capable black and brown employees previously invisible to businesses were finally being seen, heard and appreciated. Eyes were opened to the societal determinants such as low pay, zero hour contracts, poor housing and health inequalities contributing to the disproportionate illness and mortality rate of Black and Brown people from the Coronavirus. Of the first  doctors to die, for example,  were of African and Asian descent.  In generalyou were a Black man you were four times more likely to die. It was against this hyper-sensitive backdrop that Floyd’s death exploded race protests we hadn’t seen in the UK for generations. “I can’t breathe” was their rallying cry. The young protesters, Black and white demanded a nation confront and dismantle the long standing pillars of institutional racism. The footballing world took the knee. Sir Lewis Hamilton used his global  to ask his searching questions. Academic institutions accepted that our nation’s story needs to better explain how its dark past built institutions, perpetuated global inequality and maintained a hierarchy of race.  Sadly this Government has set itself full square against the greatest conversation our nation had had for some time with faux culture wars. But our society remains ready to embrace our past and the ways in which some of it still negatively influences the present.

It is not very nice.Do you have a similar story  Email webnews@mirror. In a day you can see a rat like  times. Kids see them when they are walking to school as they cross the street. Weaposve had them in our back garden. It is a concern for everyone but we donapost know what to do. It is scaring the kids as they walk to school. They are big and it is not nice. Mr Gillani said residents have a responsibility to keep the streets tidy and it is Nottingham City Councilaposs job to clean up. He said some residents tend to leave bags of rubbish next to their bins on the street, leaving him wonderingthat has something to do with the infestation. He shared photos which show rats in the street and in his back garden. Mr Gillani said: When we moved in the council was talking to the tenants saying do not dump stuff. People are not thinking. They are responsible as well, not just the council. Nottinghamaposs rat population has soared by  per cent in the past year, as rodents migrate from commercial areas to residential streets. Pest controllers say the first lockdown in  allowed rats to breed more readily. Councillor Pavlos Kotsonis, who represents the area where the estate is located, said: It is an issue that is mainly related to the bins. It is a serious concern. The biggest problem we have is Government cuts to have officers on the ground to help these things. Our teams are under pressure. Lots of stuff is happening but we need more money for resources. It is not just Syed, there are a number of residents concerned about rats. One of the main issues is the bins and we are doing all we can to address the issue. New students come every year so it is hard work to explain every year when it is bin day. The council has urged people to remove or securely store food sources, clear overgrown vegetation and rubbish from gardens, and repair holes in walls, missing drain covers and other defects to deter rat infestations.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnGiant rats"},{"url":null,"title":"girl 13 left needing surgery","story":"NewsGirl, , left needing surgery on appendix and bowel after copying TikTok crazeFay Elizabeth, from Merseyside, is desperate to warn other parents about the dangerous new TikTok trend that sees kids place magnetic ball bearings on either side of their tongue to create a pretend piercingmirrorShareCommentsByLee Grimsditch:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe young girl had to endure hours of surgery after swallowing magnetic beads \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

In an apparent criticism of his own father and even the Queen indirectly, Harry said he had endured some form of pain or suffering because of his own dadaposs experiences growing up. Now, the Mail Online reports that an insider has claimed that Meghan introduced Harry to aposancestral healingapos to deal with his trauma.An insider claimed: She said she learned about generational trauma from her mum who started taking her to weekly services at Agapé International and credits itaposs founder Michael Beckwith for teaching her about spirituality. Meghan said both she and Harry come from a long lineage of pain and suffering, generations of genetic baggage and that itaposs now up to them to break the cycle once and for all. The unnamed source added: Meghan is also a big advocate of tapping therapy and said she started tapping regularly after watching the documentary Heal. The emotional freedom technique is an alternative treatment for physical pain and emotional distress, also referred to as tapping or psychological acupressure. The publication also reports that Meghan practices aposReikiapos on herself which is a Japanese form of alternative therapy commonly referred to as aposenergy healing.apos It involves the transfer of universal energy from the practitioner’s palms to their patient.  In the new Apple series, Harry spoke about losing his mum Diana when he was just -years-old, and how he felt angry that the world mourned her when they hadnapost even met her. He memorably walked behind his mumaposs coffin at her funeral with his brother Prince William and other members of the Royal Family. Harry explained:showing one tenth of the emotion that everybody  was showing: This was my mum - you never even met her. I was so angry with what happened to her and that there was no justice, at all.

On Tuesday, crowds gathered across the country as part of co-ordinated tributes to Mr Floyd, whose murder sparked an outcry and international protest. Organisers said the week of action was launched to aposcommemorate George Floyd’s death one year on, in the spirit of the Black Lives Matter movement.apos Ex-police officer Derek Chauvin, , was last month found guilty of the murder and manslaughter of Mr Floyd on May  , after kneeling on his neck for nine minutes. The organised demonstrations yesterday were part of a week of action organised by Stand Up To Racism and the Trades Union Congress.  Many joined the demonstrations with crowds gathered in cities including London, Edinburgh and Newcastle. James Eaden joined about  people at Rykneld Square in Chesterfield as part of the action, which he said was an important part of continuing the message of the Black Lives Matter movement. Black Lives Matter has to be a aposmovement and not just a momentapos, Mr Eaden said. We have made important strides in taking an anti-racist message into our community... but racism continues. Vineeth Ravindran, an NHS cardio-respiratory physiotherapist, organised the taking of the knee with his colleagues at Borders General Hospital in Melrose, Scotland. It was very relevant for all of us to reflect upon Georgeaposs death today to stand up against racism and embrace cohesive community spirit to reduce health inequalities, the -year-old said. Especially after the pandemic, we want to create an environment where everyone feels valued. Johanna, a writer who did not wish to share her second name, joined the tributes by kneeling on her doorstep in Bristol. I took part in the tribute to George Floyd because I believe that all people deserve equal rights and respect, she said.  It can be hard for white people to understand the depth of the problem, especiallythey have had hard lives themselves.

A a dog desperately needed some of her excess fur cutting down while groomers were shut last year, prompting her owner, hair stylist Claudia Brewer, to have a go at home. But, rather hilariously, things went drastically wrong when Pepper, the mischievous toy schnauzer, spent half an hour completely refusing to let her go anywhere near her torso, having already had her head and legs completely shaved. She likes her feet done, but then as I was going up her legs she was a dficult customer, Claudia explained. She doesnapost like itI try to cut underneath her, so I tried to cut the main body but then I just avoided it and turned her into a little sheep. But, despite the unusual cut, Pepper doesnapost seem to mind her new sheep dog look, and she has even become a viral sensation on TikTok. She doesnapost want to be a dog, she wants to be a sheep. She seems to like it and sheaposs not getting too hot. Now my nephew wants me to shave his dog like a teddy bear. We struggled getting an appointment and Iaposd bought some dog sheers on Instagram, so I thought Iaposll just do it, Claudia said.I was dying laughing. And then we had a party for Motheraposs Day and people were asking aposwhat is that apos They went nuts over her new look. She gets lots of attention and everyone wants to see her. People are always asking about her. Iaposm going to leave the haircut. In clips shared to TikTok, the -year-old pooch can be seen fluttering her long eyelashes with her head fur cut down to her collar and her almost-bare legs sticking out from her flurry body.

Sofia Sapega, a -year-old Russian citizen, was detained along with the Lithuania-based blogger after their flight was erted by a warplane to Minsk on Sunday. The Belarus warplane intercepted a Ryanair passenger jet carrying Mr Protasevich, a journalist critical of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, in an act denounced by Western powers as state piracy. Sofia, a student who was travelling with Protasevich, was also detained. It was in connection with the suspicion of having committed, between August and September , offences under several articles of the Belarusian Criminal Code, a Russian Foreign Ministry statement said. Belarusian authorities have extended her detention for two months, TASS news agency reports. A video posted on a pro-Lukashenko channel on the Telegram messaging app on Tuesday night showed a young woman sitting in a chair who said she was Sofia Sapega. In the footage she admitted that she was the editor of a social media channel which has disclosed the personal information of Belarusian law enforcement personnel, a crime in Belarus. Her mum, Anna Dudich, said in an interview on Tuesday that her daughter was innocent and simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. The RIA news agency reported that Sofia feels well and has not complained of inappropriate treatment, citing Russiaaposs embassy to Belarus. It plans to take all measures to protect and support her, it added. Sofia is a student at a university in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius and was flying there with Roman Protasevich from Greece. Meanwhile, Romanaposs mum Natalia Protasevich has begged the international community to save her son.  In an interview she said: Iaposm asking, Iaposm begging, Iaposm calling on the whole international community to save him. Heaposs only one journalist, heaposs only one child but please, please. I am begging for help. Please save him. Theyaposre going to kill him in there. He had already appeared in a released video on Monday where he acknowledged playing a role in organising mass disturbances in Minsk last year. But to his dad, Dzmitry Protasevich, the video appeared to be a result of coercion. In response to the incident airlines re-routed flights to avoid Belarusaposs airspace on Tuesday and Belarusian planes faced a possible ban from Europe, as international outrage mounted. Western countries accused Belarus of hijacking and piracy over the interception of the Ryanair plane as it crossed the country.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnRyanair"},{"url":null,"title":"mouse plague forcing farmers flee","story":"NewsMouse plague forcing farmers to flee homes in Australia and could last two yearsThe growing mouse plague crisis in New South Wales, Australia is continuing to worsen, with latest figures showing reported sightings have doubled since March mirrorShareCommentsBySam TrueloveNews reporter:,  MAY NewsIts feared the rodent crises could last a further two years \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Itaposs feared the crisis could even last a further two years, with latest figures showing a growing number of mice have been sighted in and around Sydney, New South Wales, in recent months. According to New South Wales Farmers Vice President Xavier Martin, the value of crops may drop by up to  millionbaits and traps fail to work.Mr Martin added that some farmers were abandoning some paddocks and couldnapost defer sowing winter crops any longer, Mail Online reports.In a bid to halt the crisis, the NSW government announced a  million assistance package last week, but Mr Martin says this isnapost helping. The state governmentaposs assistance package is impractical, dysal and weeks away, which is not helping farmers who need support right now to drive mouse numbers down and break this horrible unrelenting cycle, he said. After more than eight months of battling growing mouse numbers farmers are still waiting for state government assistance to hit the ground and offer some practical support to our farming community. The worst-hit areas have been the Northern Tablelands, Central West and New England regions of NSW, but there are fears the plague could reach even Sydney in coming months. Researchers even warned that without a concerted baiting effort in the next few weeks this could easily turn into a two-year plague event. Farmers previously told of the ground appearing to move with masses of the critters as they filmed hordes of thousands of mice running around just metres from their homes.  Farmer Ron Mckay told the ABC: “At night... the ground is just moving with thousands and thousands of mice just running around.” Last week the NSW government said it had secured , litres of the super-deadly rodent poison bromadiolone. This amount is enough to treat about  tonnes of grain, but some farmers are concerned about the poisonaposs possible effect on farm dogs and other animals. Mr Martin said: NSW Farmers has consistently said the simplest, safest and most timely way for the state government to assist farmers would be through providing rebates of up to , per farm business to cover % of the cost of zinc phosphide bait.  He added: ’This mouse plague will be a signicant financial hit to the NSW economy, as it is not just about the grain crop, and food production, but also all the regional businesses, traders and employees that rely on the farming sector. The NSW grains industry alone employs more than , people in regional areas. Each day we delay in taking effective action to control these mice will increase economic losses and the likelihood we will still be battling mice come Christmas time.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNew South Wales Company Ltd.Xavier MartinAnimals"},{"url":null,"title":"mum journalist taken hijacked ryanair","story":":root Mum of journalist taken from hijacked Ryanair flight begging whole world to save him’The Lithuania-based blogger and his female companion, Sofia Sapega, were both taken into custody after Belarus scrambled a warplane to intercept a Ryanair aircraft flying from AthensMum of journalist taken from hijacked Ryanair flight begging whole world to save him’The Lithuania-based blogger and his female companion, Sofia Sapega, were both taken into custody after Belarus scrambled a warplane to intercept a Ryanair aircraft flying from AthensNatalia Protasevich gave the interview in Wroclaw, PolandImage: AFP via Getty ImagesByWilliam WalkerNews Reporter:,  May The mum of detained dissident journalist Roman Protasevich has called on the international community to save him.

or do not wish to attend # lets us know as soon as possible.#Each letter contains contact details for rearranging appointments. Please use these as it enables us to offer slots to other people in a planned way.#Simply not turning up means we have to arrange appointments at short notice, which results in a poorer experience for everyone coming for vaccination.“We have already offered a number of targeted community clinics, in both Aberdeen City and Moray, to enable as many people to get vaccinated as possible.mdash Aberdeen City CouncilMay , #We are planning to run more of these clinics, some of which may operate on a drop-in basis.#A self-registration portal is now open for everyone aged  to  and so far, over , have registered from Grampian.#The portal to register is open until Friday, June  and can be accessed here.Those without internet access or a smartphone can call the national helpline on    to register instead.Those who turn  between May ,  and the end of March  will be appointed via a letter.Appointments for this group are expected to commence later in June.An NHS Grampian spokeswoman added: “Overall, the uptake of the offer to be vaccinated has been incredibly successful, we will continue to work with all age groups and communities to ensure the uptake is as high as possible.”First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reiterated the importance of getting vaccinated at yesterday#s coronavirus briefing.She added: #All of us continue to have a part to play, in particular, the importance of vaccination.#The latest data shows that two doses of either vaccine offer high levels of protection against this new iant.#We also expect that vaccines will offer even higher levels of effectiveness against hospitalisation and dying.#We are currently working to accelerate the programme as far and as fast as supply allows, that includes speeding up second doses.#Obviously, we can only vaccinateeveryone comes forward when they get their appointment letter.#At some sites over the weekend, we saw quite a high level of non-attendance for appointments, which had been scheduled.#Although, it is important to stress that overall uptake rates remain incredibly high.#And it is also important to say when people don#t attend there will be a iety of reasons for this.

access to the East Beach in Lossiemouth has moved a step closer.Final plans have been submitted to Moray Council to build the crossing to replace the current structure, which has been shut due to safety concerns since July .The loss of the bridge, which is affectionately known to locals as the “briggie”, has had a devastating impact on the Moray town with the annual economic impact estimated at £.million.About , people are estimated to cross the bridge every year with the sands popular among tourists, dog walkers, watersports enthusiasts and bird watchers.If approved, construction is expected to begin late this year or early next year with the first beach-goers due to walk across in spring .The location of the new East Beach bridge in Lossiemouth has proved controversial while plans have been drawn up.A survey carried out by the Lossiemouth Community Development Trust, which spearheaded the campaign for a replacement crossing, established that % of locals wanted it built in the Seatown location of current bridge.However, Moray Council decided the Scottish Government-funded project would be built downstream in a new location on the Clton Road esplanade due to it being £, cheaper.Concerns from locals have centred on fears about currents in the area and exposure to stormy weather.Documents submitted to planners by contractors Beaver Bridges explain the design and location have been chosen to increase safety.It adds: “Positioning the bridge more local to the amenities of Clton Road can present opportunities to both business and users, enabling more ready access to shops and cafes when visiting the beach.“This location also has the potential to alleviate some safety concerns, particularly the existing issue of people ing off the current bridge into the river.“Having the bridge in a more populated open area will inherently discourage antisocial behaviour, this can also be true of vandalism.”Meanwhile, documents say wires within the structure “can be easily replaced at a reasonable cost”damaged by weather with the arched peak design to allow flood water to flow underneath.Fears have been raised that the proposed location of the bridge in the plans could lead to traffic concerns along the Lossiemouth waterfront.Parking spaces on Clton Road near where the crossing is poised to be built are limited.Beaver Bridges is proposing improvements to encourage beach-goers to continue to use nearby car parks while addressing road safety issues.The current zebra crossing on Clton Road is poised to be replaced with traffic lights and widened to accommodate more pedestrians.Existing footpaths on the waterfront will be widened with signs from the East Beach and esplanade car parks to direct people to the bridge.It is also hoped the improvements will encourage more cyclists.Cherished Lossiemouth bridge to be demolished within months despite pleas to save it\" title\"#Cherished Lossiemouth bridge to be demolished within months

spreading the word of God in an unusual way during the Covid lockdown as he has taken his sermons on the road.Reverend Alastair Bruce of the Ellon Parish Church found a unique way to #engage# with members of his congregation once church buildings shut due to lockdown.On each of his sermons, Mr Bruce takes viewers to the outdoors, speaking from ious dferent locations across the north-east.These include Collieston and the River Ythan.In most of them, he utilises his surroundings to aid his storytelling.The sermons have become a smash hit across the region, with viewers tuning in from South Africa, Australia, and even deepest, darkest Wales.Mr Bruce was inspired to venture outdoors for his presentations after watching Reverend Martin Fair, the moderator of the Church of Scotland#s General Assembly, do a similar thing.Mr Bruce started his unique sermons last summer and plans to continue them until the churches reopen properly.He said: #It started as I was thinking of what I could do dferently to help engage people during lockdown, where they might be feeling isolated and cannot visit the church.#We were forced to do things virtually, but I didn’t want to just do a sermon of me talking to the camera in my office or a piece to camera.#I took inspiration from Martin Fair, who went viral doing the same, talking outdoors.#People love the countryside, and with people locked down and unable to go outside, I thought why not do them outside and see what the reaction is.#Funnily enough, when I did some throughout Ellon, people who have lived here for a while didn’t know where I was, and I had some people asking me where I am, where have I been, it brought people together.#Mr Bruce films the videos himself while out and about in the north-east, making use of his phone and easy-to-use equipment.He uses his iPhone, his headphones, a small radio mic, and a tripod to record himself speaking.Mr Bruce added: #It is easier because I can just go for a wee walk and everything is there for me to perform the sermon.#I#ve got an app that is a teleprompter so I can read it from there and play through the sermon on the phone, it#s amazing what you can do.#It#s just a simple set-up, nothing sophisticated at all.#Mr Bruce goes to quieter parts of the town so that he does not disturb anyone but occasionally comes across people walking their dog.He added: #Some people do give me slightly odd looks but the walking about can be used to build up relationships and our pastoral care.#People do stop and ask what I am doing and are fascinated by it all.The -year-old has even branched out with his sermons, taking them to the likes of Slains Castle near Cruden Bay.They have been described as like #Countryfile# by one of his friends.Mr Bruce explained the reasoning behind choosing some of the best-known places as background to his sermons.He said: #I did one about places that can mean a lot to people or things that help people feel closer to God.#I did this on the Brig of Balgownie as a sort of illustration and the fact it is a historic landmark in Scotland, and when you are on it you can sense the history.#These places can illustrate what I am talking about, and it allows me to compare the stories as well.#My first one was when I was preaching about Jesus walking on water, and then Peter coming to him from a boat.#I thought it would be funnyI walked into the middle of the Ythan, obviously not on water but just walk through it, just to engage folks.#In the end, you couldn’t see it that well, and the river was a bit deeper than I thought it would be, so I only rolled up my trousers to d it.#I gave it a bash, and they worked out well so now been doing it ever since.#One of my friends described them as watching Countryfile, which is cheesy but it is a description I will take as it means it is coming across well.#Mr Bruce has been continuing these sermons almost every week, and they are broadcast every Sunday over Facebook and Youtube.They draw in more than  viewers across both s, and many more on-demand.The viewers include relatives of church-goers from South Africa and Australia, while people from a retreat centre in Wales also tune in after coming across them on Facebook.The church also delivers DVDs of the sermon to those in the community who do not have access to them on social media.Mr Bruce revealed that this formed part of the church#s plans to make sure people did not feel abandoned during the Covid pandemic.Candle of Hope  MayJoin Rev Alastair to prayPosted by Ellon Parish Church on Sunday, May , He said: #People were isolated and anxious and needed to know that God and the church were there for them and this idea helped to engage and support folks.#At the height of Covid we posted something on Facebook every day, live prayers, sermons.#We have eased this slightly as restrictions eased, as it was needed less and allowed people to spend time with families and there is not quite as high a need.#This allowed us to show that we had no abandoned people and offer them help and support.#The Church has a message of hope and this is how we conveyed that.#The feedback we have got so far is that it has really helped people and gave them an anchor to hold onto.#The buildings were closed, but the church community is active.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content,

daily updated charts and maps to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland.The table below shows an at-a-glance view of the situation in each local authority. It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began.After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus.The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-. Use the dropdown to navigate to your health board.The chart below shows the number of new tests reported each day. This figure shows all tests carried out, regardless of the result.In October, Public Health Scotland released testing data at a regional level.

An R-value of three would mean the average person with Covid- would go on to infect another three people.As Covid- death recording is so complex, a more reliable measure is excess deaths. Excess deaths are the dference between the total recorded deaths by all causes and the average of the previous five years. The chart below shows this for the UK constituent countries.

It’s been a long journey, rewarding in many ways but also challenging and demanding – but AFC has been fortunate, throughout my time at the club, to have had great people at all levels who have repeatedly gone the extra mile, recognising how important it is that the club performs well in all respects and continues to play its unique role within the community.“While there must always be a focus on success on the pitch, I firmly believe that we must also preserve and foster the special relationships that exist between the club, its fans and the wider community – and I think that with the Trust and the club working closely together, we now have an impact that is more extensive and of greater benefit to the community than ever before.“I’m confident that the teams of people at the club and the Trust, with their collective ability, enthusiasm and commitment, will ensure that both continue to prosper, and I wish them every success.”Aberdeen chairman Dave Cormack has paid tribute to Buchan.He said: “Gordon has been an outstanding servant to the club. His wise counsel, dedication and passion for AFC over such a long period of time are admirable and while he will be missed at board level, I know he will continue to be an ambassador for the club and certainly no stranger to Pittodrie.“On a personal level, I’d like to thank Gordon for his support over the last four years, during which we’ve implemented a forward‐thinking strategy both on and off the field, including closer ties with the AFC Community Trust, opened our new training facilities and, of course, tackled the financial and public health challenges caused by the pandemic.“We will be organising a fitting tribute to honour Gordon’s long service to the club. In the meantime, everyone at the club wishes him all the very best for a long and happy retirement.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement. That means we are an essential part of the system.It seems clear that we are going to have to fight to get past the unconscious assumptions of decision makers.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

With their strong Gaelic and Norse heritage they defied the will of kings, and their political influence was undeniable.This independence of spirit might account, in part at least, for a modern-day habit of Islay folk # to enter the world of politics.With the election earlier this month of Jenni Minto as constituency MSP, the island now has three serving Argyll and Bute politicians, with council leader Councillor Robin Currie and Councillor Alastair Redman.Orkney and Shetland LibDem MP Alistair Carmichael, another Ileach, can be added to the list # and there may be more out there.Then there is George Robertson # now Lord Robertson of Port Ellen # former Labour politician and Secretary General of NATO, and the much-respected late Labour leader John Smith, both of whom have Islay connections.All of the above from an island of little more than , people.The Argyllshire Advertiser decided to ask the politicians themselves for their theories about why Islay has the habit of producing a preponderance of politicians.Leader of Argyll and Bute Council Robin Currie explained: #Ileachs are known for their sense of community, their enthusiasm for their island and their culture, and their erse mix of skills and resilience # so it#s no surprise that so many of us want to take that a stage further by representing not only our own island but the whole of Argyll and Bute, or indeed the country itself, as is the case with George Robertson and the late John Smith.#All of these characteristics will stand anyone in good stead when it comes to le as an elected representative, whether that’s at local or national government level.#It#s great that [in Argyll and Bute] we have a good balance of elected representatives of all political flavours, who understand the needs and characteristics of that mix of communities, and who can bring that knowledge together to work on issues of strategic as well as local importance.#Councillor Currie added: #It goes without saying that I wish my fellow Ileach, Jenni Minto, every success in her new role and I look forward to working with her.#Conservative Alastair Redman # one of three councillors serving Kintyre and the Isles alongside Councillor Currieand Tarbert#s Anne Horn# pointed to Islay#s #unique economy and location# as part of the reason for its political prominence.#Islay is both rural and at the same time heavily industrialised with our large number of distilleries,# he said.#It might be considered isolated yet is a global trading powerhouse. We on Islay have a population of just a few thousand yet our name is world famous.#There is also our history which to a degree separates us from mainland Scotland. Finlaggan was the seat of the Lords of the Isles under Clan Donald with roots that go back beyond the Kingdom of Scotland, beginning with Somerled in the th century.#I feel that this has led to Ileachs being more independent and perhaps at times more forthright than others.#I hope that many more councillors, MSPs, MPs, cabinet ministers, lords and even prime ministers will come from my home island which, though small, has made a huge mark on this world.#The last word goes to the newest member of Islay#s political gang, Jenni Minto MSP.The SNP member also cited the island#s past influence on Scottish politics through Finlaggan and the Lordship of the Isles.And she highlighted more examples of single-minded Ileachs making their mark on the world.#In - three ships with Islay people on board sailed for the New York colony,# said Ms Minto.#On one of these was five-year-old Alexander McDougall, who became a key figure in America’s war for independence. He had a very successful le, rising to the rank of Major General in the continental army. He then entered public service and was elected to the New York state senate. On his death he was described by George Washington as one of the five pillars of the American revolution.##I am not Islay-born,# she continued, #but feel very lucky to live on such a wonderful island. I often describe it as the centre of the universe, and there are very few places you can visit without meeting someone from Islay or someone who has a connection with the island.#I think that coming from, or living on, an island you need a level of resilience and creativity but you also have a true sense of community and working together.#Islay is also known to be a friendly place, where everyone has time to chat and listen to other people’s thoughts and views.#I think all of these traits are needed in politics and so perhaps it is not a surprise that Islay people have entered public service.#PICS:Jenni Minto MSP. no_aScotElection_McglynnArgyll and Bute Council leader, Robin Currie. aelectionCurrienoCouncillor Alastair Redman.

However, there now seems to be an acceptance in Transport Scotland that a new solution has to be found.In a letter to the press, George Allan points out that the -mile route from Strathlachlan to Colintraive and the eight miles between Ormidale and Tighnabruaich were designed and constructed in  or  years.I was a member of the survey and design team on these routes. I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.Philip Shimmin, Inverness.Sir,I would like to say thank you to all the lads who have been working at the Crinan Canal # often when the north winds were blowing and water was pouring down from the hills into the empty canal more quickly than the pumps were able to remove it.The men greeted me each morning as I walked past to go over the temporary bridge. They were trying to renew the basement concrete which supports the new bridges in spite of the wet, cold weather.Fortunately, April was drier and they managed to fit the new gates thanks to the massive cranes and the skill of the lorry drivers carrying these heavy loads to and from the canal.Others have cleared the rubbish, including lots of old car tyres, which had been dumped.It is good to see the canal filled and in working order again.J Thorgrimsson, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"reduce farm costs save time and make life easier","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

With the evenings getting longer and brighter you can use your garden or patio as a great extension to your home and just sit back and relax.It’s at this time of year that lawns need to be mowed more frequently, so here are some key pointers on getting that perfect cared-for look.Mow at least once a week and raise the mower blades when it’s very hot weather. Don’t mow when grass is wet or during a drought and don’t collect your clippings during dry spells as this helps conserve moisture.Keep watering throughout the summer unless there is a water shortage and repair bare patches with turf or re-seeding.This is also the month to ensure that all your plants are adequately fed, particularly those in baskets and tubs.Plants benefit from a regular feeding programme as they are growing vigorously and need their nutrition levels to be kept up. Slow-release granules are a good idea for pots and baskets because they last for about six months and release food as it is required into the compost.Not often thought of as a container plant, but an excellent option for small gardens, is a rose.A simple solution for June is to create an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.Just buy a selection of dferent sized pots, plant them with a ieties of roses and then place them together in a group.There is a rose for every garden situation. From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew. Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and midsummer day arrives, here are few ‘must do’ jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters a unique holiday destination","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But never mind, Chinese astronauts, who regard a moon base as essential for probing outer space, have just about solved these problems with a bioregenerative le support system called Yuegong-, or Lunar Palace  . LP is a temperature and humidity-controlled, sealed, articial human-animal-plant-microorganism ecosystem in which oxygen, water and food sources are recycled to create an Earth-like environment. The latest experiment had LP in use continuously for a whole year, with two crews of four each having two periods of occupation and the maximum stay being  days. All emerged fit and healthy.LP comprises a living area, two cabins for growing plants , an animal-raising room housing yellow mealworms and waste treatment and storage rooms.Crew requirements # food, water, oxygen and waste disposal # are accommodated as follows: plants and mealworms provide food, the latter being processed into ‘flour’ for bread.Plant photosynthesis provides oxygen and consumes CO, while puried water from plant transpiration and condensation provides drinking and washing water.Nitrogen puried from crew urine generates plant fertiliser, while the remaining urine is puried along with waste water for plant irrigation.Crew faeces mixed with straw are fermented by bacteria to produce CO for plant photosynthesis, while fermented vegetable waste is fed to the mealworms. The whole system achieved  per cent recycling, the only non-recyclable product requiring storage being solid waste from fermented faeces.All this represents huge progress, but we are not there yet. Running LP requires massive energy input, particularly since lunar days and nights each last an Earth month, and the nights are freezing.But still, I have read of plans to build kilometre-high lunar towers bearing solar  , possible because of the moon’s zero gravity, but don’t hold your breath!* https:doi.org . ...# arxiv.org abs ."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 21 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Eight designs will be chosen to become stamps which will be on sale across the UK.Children may choose to illustrate frontline workers in health or social care.They may want to celebrate other key workers who have kept the country going, such as refuse collectors, cleaners, teachers, supermarket workers, public transport staff, delivery drivers or, indeed, postmen and postwomen.Or they might highlight the volunteers who have helped in their local communities or raised money for charity, such as the late Captain Sir Tom Moore.The competition is open until Friday May . A special  of judges will select the winners. As with all special stamps, the final eight designs will be sent to HM The Queen before they can be printed and issued as stamps. The winners will be announced in the autumn.We cannot wait to see who children choose to honour on their stamp. The past year has been very dficult for everyone, so let#s show the heroes of the pandemic just how much we appreciate what they have done for us.Full details can be found at www.royalmail stampcompetitionAs a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties in the Scottish Parliament election to tackling the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.The commitment by the political parties to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, is therefore to be appreciated and must be a priority for the next parliament.Our children are remarkably resilient, but the frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many of them presents a compelling case for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This mental health crisis is one we can address, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that which was demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures – and themselves.The British Hedgehog Preservation Society is asking people create their very own haven for the UK#s only spiny mammal this Hedgehog Awareness Week, from May -.Gardens are a stronghold for hedgehogs, and we can make their lives so much easier with very little effort.Tips will be given out on our social media accounts during the week using #hedgehogweek with daily competitions to win hedgehoggy prizes.There are many things we can all do to help hedgehogs.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The shutdown means the loss of nine jobs at the plant, but local farmers believe the knock-on effect on employment will be even worse.Farmer and shareholder in the company Tony Archibald said: #It could mean the loss of another job on every dairy farm, not to mention the milk tanker driver.#The farmers are looking at ways of opening the creamery. It is very important because it is the one thing we have as a raw material for over here.#The farmers were due to meet as the Courier went to press to discuss ways of re-opening the creamery and they also plan to meet representatives of Scottish Milk.Mr Coffield described the closure as #devastating#. He said: #There#s not a lot of work round here. The main feeling about the place is disbelief.#The creamery produced about  tonnes of cheese a year.FIFTY YEARS AGOColour TV comes to CampbeltownColour television is to be launched in Campbeltown next Tuesday by Redfusion.And to mark the occasion, Redfusion is staging a demonstration exhibition in the town#s White Hart Hotel, where about six sets will be on view.The exhibition will be open to the public for three days.

I am grateful to the Courier reviewer and to the other reviewers in the BBC, ITV and papers from Stornoway to London for giving it such a good start.#My advice to young authors  Stick at it. The first  books are the worst!#His latest book for children, Super Nova and the Frozen Man, is also doing well in hard cover and paperback. Most of Angus#s books are published in European countries, and some in America, but only the other day he heard this one is being published in Japan.#I#d rather have heard that my golf handicap is coming down, but that would be even more of a miracle.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOPlease noteThe change in the publishing day of the Courier to Thursday of each week instead of Friday has proved so acceptable to readers, particularly to the large number resident outside the district, that we have resolved to make the arrangement a permanent one.Sparks and flashesA meeting will be held in the Town Hall on Friday evening with the object of forming a branch of An Comunn Gàidhealach in Campbeltown.Neil M#Bain is among the latest of the Ayr United Football Club players to fix up for another season.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance. Anyone who feels they are able to help can contact Campbell Robertson, club secretary.For more club updates, follow @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"budding young photographers make their mark","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Known only to the world mysteriously as #Pat#, he decided to part with his , bottle library last year, through a series of auctions, with a mission to share his passion for whisky with the world by passing his bottles on to new owners.Joe Wilson, head of auction content at Whisky Auctioneer, said: #Fèis Ìle is an iconic celebration of whisky and Islay culture that draws people back to the island year after year.#From Port Ellen to Bowmore and Bruichladdich to Ardbeg, this collection of Fèis Ìle bottlings is without a doubt the largest and most complete we have ever encountered.#The auction presents the rare opportunity for collectors and whisky drinkers to acquire some incredibly scarce malts that have been produced to celebrate the history of this iconic whisky region.#Examples from each of Islay#s eight single-malt producing distilleries feature in the sale, including complete collections of every single limited edition festival bottling from distilleries including Bowmore, Laphroaig and Lagavulin.The sale also features bottles that have been donated to the Fèis Ìle committee by distilleries to raise charitable funds for the island through their Islay Wave Project, which will focus on ways to support culture, artists and youth.Included in the charity lots is the oldest and rarest release directly from the iconic Islay distillery, Port Ellen. The Port Ellen -year-old # Rogue Casks# is the second release in the #Untold Stories# series, which explores the intriguing history of the Islay distillery ahead of its re-opening after closure almost three decades ago.Florence Grey, chairperson of the Fèis Ìle committee, said: #Fèis Ìle was delighted to be given the bottles in this charity auction from Diageo, plus a signed bottle from the legendary Islay whisky maker Jim McEwan.#All the proceeds raised from these bottles will benefit our island community as the funds will kickstart our Islay Wave Project # an ongoing project that will begin after this year#s virtual festival.#Focusing on ways to support our island#s culture, artists and youth, The Islay Wave Project concentrates on everything we celebrate throughout Fèis Ìle.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura. Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen. It is not intended, of course, to confine the benefits of the scheme to miners or their dependents. Over £ has already been raised and the committee intend to publish the list of subscriptions next week.A welcome break in our comparative isolation from the mainland was made at the beginning of the week when the steamer Kinloch made a special run to the upper reaches, with mail, passengers and cargo.Many merchants, not only in Campbeltown but at Carradale and the west of Arran ports, were carrying very low stocks and this run was not made a day too soon to prevent absolute scarcity of not a few necessities.Flour, for one thing, was running very short, and the new supplies got by bakers were very much-needed.Alcohol is again tipped as a likely rival to petrol. The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin. The idea of using alcohol is not new, but a fatal obstacle has been the unwillingness of the government to release its hold upon alcohol and permit it to be used for commercial purposes."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future.

Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in.

Any forward player will tell you that.

Lots of people do much the same in political terms when they use the EU to mean Europe, of course.But anyone watching the Eurovision Song Contest last weekend will have noticed that there are almost as many non-EU nations in Europe as there are ones who send MEPs to Brussels. Of the top five results, three were non-EU nations.Even when you leave out Israel and Australia, which obviously arenrsquot in Europe, and places like Russia and Turkey, which have only a proportion of their territory in geographical Europe , half the field was non-EU ndash and thatrsquos after a similar number were eliminated at the semi-finals.:Andrew McKie: Is this the end of summer holidays abroad One that wasnrsquot, or at least not conventionally, was Belarus, which didnrsquot even feature. Its song was disqualied for lyrics that were ldquotoo political, which meant that it was a hymn of praise for the repressive tactics of Alexander Lukashenko, the countryrsquos president since  .Itrsquos unlikely that yoursquod get far with lyrics arguing the opposite side in Belarus people have been fined for wearing the wrong colour of socks, and one man was arrested because an old cardboard box on his balcony happened to resemble the opposition flag.However, even by the standards of the man routinely described as ldquoEuropersquos last dictator ndash I have to assume thatrsquos when you donrsquot include Russia or the southern Caucasus ndash the interception of a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius is shocking.Whether Roman Protasevich, whose arrest was the pretext for what amounts to an act of state-sponsored terrorism, is best characterised as an activist or a journalist, he is now facing  years in jailfor daring to criticise a man who has held power for more than quarter of a century by oppression and subversion of democracy and civil liberties.There are other instances of what most of us would regard as authoritarian governments where in Europe ndash even, in the case of Hungary, within the EU. There have often been trumped up charges brought against journalists and opposition politicians ndash places such as Turkey, Russia andUkraine spring to mind immediately, but less obviously repressive nations, such as Slovenia, Moldova, and Albania have also used such tactics against those critical of the authorities. The Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was murdered for investigating political corruption.Those cases are bad enough to make people who compare Covid regulations to Nazi repression, or regard the likes of Emmanuel Macron, Boris Johnson or, for that matter, Sir Keir Starmer as ldquofar-right look utterly ridiculous. But itrsquos not surprising that the citizens of comfortable Western democracies pay little attention to the internal politics of countries on what we think of as the fringe of Europe , nor even that our national politicians and the international community are reluctant to get too involved.It is an unfortunate fact about diplomatic relations that there are a lot of disagreeable regimes out there, and we usually feel that they have to be particularly obnoxious before itrsquos our job to do much more than moan ineffectually about their ldquodefective record on human rights.Plenty of worthwhile campaigning organisations and iniduals nonetheless do sterling work in drawing public attention to these abuses. Some cases, however, are so iniquitous that they quite rightly lead to demands for action from governments themselves ndash evenit is not always forthcoming.High profile political murders on foreign soil are the most obvious ndash a speciality of Russia, which has done or tried it several times in the UK and where, though also of Iran, which murdered two dissidents in the Netherlands, and Saudi Arabia, which had the critical journalist Jamal Khashoggi dismembered in their consulate in Istanbul.Belarusrsquos act of piracy against a commercial aircraft in order to arrest a critic is an outrage as blatant as that ndash and perhaps even more likely to lead to repercussions from other governments. The fact that civilians were endangered on a flight between two Nato and EU countries in a clear breach of all aviation law was, as the chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee Tom Tugendhat put it: ldquoIfhellip not an act of warhellip certainly a war-like act.He, and his counterparts from several other leading countries, have already called for all flights to and from Belarus, and through its airspace, to be suspended. The EU looks quite likely to back this , but it ought to go further.:Andrew McKie: Is the conversion of political class to green issues all it seems Sanctions are often derided, with some justice, as ineffectual, as damaging to the country imposing them as the one on the receiving end, and fall hardest on ordinary citizens, who are, after all, the people being oppressed by the regime. Like tarfs and trade wars, theyrsquore easily to call for and introduce, but ultimately damaging all round. In the case of Belarus, there is the added disadvantage of strengthening the countryrsquos ties with Russia, rather than encouraging it to move towards democracy and the West.But there is at least one form of them that is effective the so-called ldquoMagnitsky legislation to freeze of bank accounts and assets ofiniduals. This is the one tactic that seems to worry Vladimir Putin, who owes his position as an autocrat to his primary role as a broker between the competing plutocrats who are the real power in Russia.Every European country, whether in the EU or not, should take the most forceful stand on this issue the US also looks likely to take action. Diplomacy may frown on regime change in sovereign nations as an objective, but Mr Lukashenkorsquos behaviour justies almost all punitive action from other nations short of an invasion.

I have a very finely curated list of must-visit places and Ive always been careful to choose my flights wisely, not wanting to waste carbon footprint or annual leave or money on a holiday for holidays sake.Fly me anywhere now, though. Im desperate to see family in Australia and New Zealand. Zanzibar and the Galapagos and New Orleans still call to me but at this rate Ill happily jet to Edinburgh just for the experience.Though... just because we can now fly overseas again, should we John Swinney said yesterday that travel is still only permitted for essential reasons. When the BBC spoke to passengers preparing to depart for Portugal they listed their reasons as a reward after a year of studying that its \"always nice\" to get a bit of sunshine and after a year of restrictions, travel is \"well deserved\".Fair enough. \"Essential\" is a term open to interpretation. For some, a wedding is essential. For others, more pragmatic others, a wedding is possibly the least essential event you could dream up.A last visit to someone ill a meeting with a new infant - these are unarguably essential.A holiday for holidays sake takes a bit of rhetoric round about to justy it, but you can justy a holiday after  months of pandemic restrictions without too much heavy lting.Looking at the green light travel options Im pleased to Australia and New Zealand on the green list, for personal reasons, but they wont let us in. Good luck finding a straightforward route to the South Georgia and Sandwich Islands - I suspect many would have to Google them first.St Helena, Tristan de Cunha and Ascension Island are fairly outre choices as well. My friend Janet went to St Helena a few years ago. She had a lovely time but the trip involved an RAF troop carrier and a voyage on the last remaining Royal Mail Ship.So options are limited for green lights. Last week a flight left England for Spain and, on arrival, those who were there for a holiday were put on another flight and sent home again. Amber gambling might not be wise.How to decide whether to fly. The Scottish Government advice, as described, is to avoid overseas travel. Yesterday, Dr Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, told BBC Radios Good Morning Scotland programme that case numbers are rising again and a third wave is not ruled out.\"It would be far better,\" she said, \"And far safer to do the cautious thing now and plan your summer holiday for next year.\"It seems like a lot of buck passing. If people are chided for choosing to go on holiday then they can point to the fact the airlines are selling tickets abroad.If the airlines are pulled up for the fact they are selling tickets abroad they can point to the government, which has given the green light for them to go ahead.If theres condemnation on the government for encouraging overseas travel then - get out of jail free - they can point right back to the people making the choice to go and say its all about personal responsibility.It feels like a blame game in the style of pass the parcel.Its hard to blame airlines for laying on flights to holiday destinations. The industry has been devastated by coronavirus - along with airports - and is looking at years of recovery ahead. Of course the travel industry is going to restart as soon as it can.This disconnect between the Scottish and UK governments is jarring also - caution here and encouragement there.Is leaving people to exercise common sense on this issue the best way forward in lockdown easing, particularly when those in charge cant decide Doors are already cross checked and to manual so we can but hope for a safe landing on the other side."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-les-dennis-now-opera-star","story":"Did I read that right  Les Dennis Yes, the comedian-turned-actor will make his operatic debut at the age of  in the Gilbert and Sullivan opera, playing Sir Joseph Porter.

CMAL. Well, good luck with that. Without any background in the subject, he will probably follow advice from those whose long-range genius created the problems in the first place.:Brian Wilson: SNP hammered hospitality but guaranteed George Square chaosThen we have the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and ndash very much a late tag-on ndash Islands, Mairi Gougeon, MSP for Angus South. The previous ldquoand Islands Minister was Paul Wheelhouse, from the Borders, who for some reason became Minister for Fergusonrsquos although, unlike Mr Dey, he was not a Transport Minister. So many Ministers, so little continuity, so much title-shuffling.The common characteristic is that none of them has constituency interests in either ferries or islands. The SNP have six MSPs in the Highlands and Islandsand none has ever been allowed near either role. This is consistent with nobody from the communities served by CMAL and CalMac being on the boards of either.I doubtthere is a coastal country in Europe, perhaps the world, where the same prohibition would be tolerated. Certainly not in the Scandinavian lands which are so often held up as role models ndash which set me thinking about the Faroes and why the idea of autonomy for the Scottish islands should be taken seriously.Ferries are only the current example. It is inconceivable that an islands-based ferry company could do a worse job. Indeed, the Western Isles Council has just put forward a very coherent plan, both short-term and medium-term, for escaping from the current mess. It should, I suggest, be Mr Deyrsquos preferred reading before he gets to the civil service brief.It would also create enough jobs to be transformational in island communities. For decades in the islands, ldquoGourock has been shorthand for mismanagement, nepotism and worse. It is an anachronism dating back to the  merger of MacBrayne with the Caledonian Steam Packet Companythat the whole show is run from there rather than some of the places it is supposed serve.The same reasoning can be applied to every distinctively island public service, run from afar. Crofting regulation is another easy example. The whole thing is a shambles regulated from a centralised bureaucracy in Inverness. It is impossible to believe it would not be more pro-active and alert to depressing realities on the groundit operated at localised levels.:Brian Wilson: Theres nothing green about iding Britain or closing down the North SeaNeither is the argument confined to the private sector. The first person I heard espouse the Faroes as a role model was the late Ian Noble who had gone there in the s and learned how economic development and cultural renaissance went hand in hand. He applied that principle in Skye, particularly as founder of Sabhal Mor Ostaig, Scotlandrsquos Gaelic college.The lesson has never been built on. Greater political and administrative autonomy would keep people in the islands ndash just as in Faroes where population has gone from , in  to almost , today. Natural entrepreneurism would flourish. How curious that one of the biggest fish farmers in our own islands was recently bought by a Faroese company. Could it ever happen the other way round The neo-colonialism exercised by Edinburgh should be replaced by serious decentralisation. No ldquosubsidy is required. The pretence Scotlandrsquos islands donrsquot pay their way is ridiculous. From Shetlandrsquos oil to Islayrsquos whisky, not to mention a disproportionate contribution to Scotlandrsquos global images and a host of world class products, the islands pay their dues many times over to UK and Scottish coffers.Anyone who actually believes in devolution would see the case for islandsrsquo autonomy ndash not as a threat or challenge but merely as a means to better, fairer, more creative governance.The same can and should be argued in urban settings. Look at the great success of the metro Mayors in England and Wales, delivering for their cities and regions because they can stand up to central government. In contrast, Scotland has a higher degree of centralisation than ever before. The challenge to that mindset could start in the islands and work its way in.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Nowhere more so than perhaps Crimea on which sanctions were imposed in  following Russias invasion of Ukraine.Ostensibly, EU nationals were banned from doing business in Russia-occupied Crimea and those who harmed ldquothe territorial integrity of Ukraine were blacklisted.But as the online newspaper EUobserver highlighted only this week using the case of Greek billionaire, Ivan Savvidi, there are those who make a mockery of EU sanctions on Russia.Mr Savvidi himself is said to be actively engaged in food supplies to Crimea and openly funds pro-Russian occupation propaganda events say analysts who suggest that any comparable sanctions imposed against Belarus will be treated by Minsk with a similar disdain.On the other hand, this weekrsquos events could yet prove a watershed moment for EU foreign policy decisions that require a unanimous agreement by the  member states, something that in the past has often proved elusive.Irelandrsquos Minister of State for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne, noted that he had ldquonever seen such anger across the EU and many firmly believe that anger will now translate into unprecedented action.Certainly, this is the moment says the blocrsquos staunchest supporters when it needs to show it has a foreign policy that works and can be relied upon to be robust and as effective as the ldquosoft policy approach some within the EU appear to favour.The fact that even Hungaryrsquos Prime Minister Viktor Orban, not always known for being an EU team player, has come out in favour of tougher action against fellow authoritarian Mr Lukashenko, suggests that this time the EU might really mean business. Should however Mr Orban pull a U-turn and again use his veto to scupper any collective action this week, fellow EU leaders many will find it hard to forgive him.But itrsquos also worth noting that the situation right now in Belarus is not the only crisis currently testing the mettle of EU foreign policy. Another part of the world is also proving to be the arena in which an important sht in EU foreign and security policy is already underway and not without generating considerable controversy.Recently, in what is undoubtedly a toughening of stance, the European bloc for the first time is now allowed to arm governments in the name of fighting terrorism, protecting civilians, and stabilising fragile states. As the Financial Times reported just a few days ago, the money for this will come from a new eurobn fund over seven years known rather incongruously as the European Peace Facility .The EPF has been described as the most signicant expansion yet in growing EU efforts to project ldquohard power to influence international conflicts particularly in regions close to its borders such as eastern Europe and Africa. A likely focus of the EPF will be in the Sahel region of West Africa in countries like Mali, Chad, and Niger where French and other forces are already engaged in tackling Islamist-inspired terrorism. DAVID PRATT:Benjamin Netanyahu ndash the Harry Houdini of Israeli politicsldquoWe are not going to stop the terrorists from killing people just by preaching, insisted EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell recently.ldquoWe need arms. We need military capacities and that is what we are going to provide, to help our African friends. Because their security is our security, Mr Borrell added.But it goes without saying that many are less than convinced by such policies, pointing to intervention and supplies of arms in the likes of Iraq and Afghanistan as sobering lessons as to what can go wrong.ldquoThere is a growing contradiction in the EUrsquos approach to conflict and crises, says Lucia Montanaro, head of the EU office of Saferworld, a non-governmental group focused on conflicts.ldquoIts strong commitments to promoting human rights, gender equality and arms control are increasingly overshadowed by efforts to boost the combat capability of authoritarian partners, Ms Montanaro was cited by the FT as saying this week expressing the concern of others.On the face of it for an EU rhetorically committed to democracy and human rights it does seem like a signicant sht in foreign policy enactment on the ground. But this is the fluid ever shting geo-political world of which the EU is part and there is simply no escaping.Whether it be an assertive Russia, the threat of jihadism or what was tantamount to an act of ldquoair piracy on a flight between two EU capitals, the EU is rapidly concluding that simply talking about a response is sometimes not enough.David Pratt is Contributing Foreign Editor.

Two members of my family in their early s are still waiting for their first jab and would happily have turned up at the Hydro at short notice over the weekend to receive their first jab. Another family member of a similar age in Edinburgh has been trying to get through to the helpline having not received a letter yet. On one occasion she was th in the queue.How much longer do we have to tolerate this waste of professional time and potential vaccine wastage in Scotland when in other parts of the UK appointments can be booked online and vaccine uptake is much higher Gill Craig, Glasgow.NHS DATABASE IS FAILING USYOUR headline story about roughly half of vaccine appointments being missed at The Hydro in Glasgow may well be linked to the NHS database being out of date in some cases.Im aware of two examples where vaccine letters were sent to people who had been absent from the addresses in question for many years. One of them arrived at my own address recently for a previous occupant, a student who left Glasgow in  tohome to China. I ed it to the sender.The second case is even more extreme. I have a friend in Leipzig who used to live in East Kilbride. He has been living in Germany for more than  years and, since Brexit, is now a German citizen. A letter with a vaccine appointment arrived at his former East Kilbride address recently and was forwarded to him by his sister, who still lives at the property. He attempted to cancel the appointment online but discovered to his consternation that this was not possible. The system would only allow him to reschedule it. He eventually gave up.While I have nothing but praise for the NHS in the attempts to have people vaccinated as quickly as possible, the evidence suggests that they have no administrative mechanism for updating their recordspeople do not contact them with this information. Electoral registration officers actively check current residency on a semi-regular basis. Why can the NHS not do the same Dave Stewart, Glasgow.* I HAVE been unsuccessful in cancelling a Covid- vaccination appointment for my son, who has not resided in the UK for seven years. There appears to be no facility online to cancel, only to reschedule, and after learning I was th in the queue on the vaccination helpline, unsurprisingly I gave up trying. My sonrsquos name will now be classed as a \"no show\". This simply goes to show the inaccuracy of statistics.S MacKay, Glasgow.WE MUST NOT GET COMPLACENTSOUTH of the Border many media reports have highlighted the surge in coronavirus hospitalisations in Bolton where most of the patients have been identied as not having had the Covid jag or only one dose of the vaccine. Yet in Glasgow thousands of people failed to turn up for Covid jag appointments at the SSE Hydro at the weekend, wasting resources and putting themselves and others at continuing risk of catching the disease.Some of the absentees from the jab appointments may have ethical or religious issues to overcome before getting the vaccine, but the huge numbers not turning up would seem to suggest that it went far beyond that, with complacency and hesitancy creeping in. There is less chance of the city being downgraded from Level the population is complacent about Covid, dissuading tourists from visiting the city and impacting on struggling businesses. Hopefully Glasgow will take heed of the Bolton crisis and avoid potential catastrophe before its too late.Bob MacDougall, Kippen.COMPLETE RETHINK IS REQUIREDYOU report on the disappointing number of people not turning up to the SEC Glasgow for vaccination this last weekend.No-one  seems to realise that not everyone has a motor car. How do people get to the SEC from the south side of Glasgow, in fact from almost anywhere in Glasgow  There are no bus services that serve the SEC. There is a railway station quite close, but not everyone lives near a railway station and people on the south side, eventhey have access to the trains, would have to change at Central.Are children and other dependants welcome at vaccination centres  Would a single parent be able to attend  Many people now work at weekends and would not be able to change work patterns at short notice. We have moved past vaccinating the \"old and stale\" who enjoyed their trip out to the SECand the system needs to cater for people with signicant other responsibilities and concerns.Tricia Fort, Glasgow.BELARUS OUTRAGE RINGS HOLLOWIT is indeed disgraceful that the government of Belarus has taken upon itself the right to hijack a foreign aircraft in order to arrest one of its passengers . Irsquom sure all our thoughts are with the young activist and his girlfriend, as well as the many other iniduals currently incarcerated for trying to counter this contemptible regime.The Westrsquos moral outrage on the matter is seriously undermined, however, by its complicity in the equally shameful abductions of foreign nationals by the United States, often from third countries, and the covert transport of these people to secret locations for interrogation and illegal detention.While in no way legitimising the Belarusian actions, American insistence on extensive extraterritorial jurisdiction and complete immunity from independent oversight over its many breaches of international law provides dictatorial governments such as Alexander Lukashenkorsquos with the opportunity to claim precedents have been set.Indignation expressed by the US, UK and others rings hollow against the background of history. Might has been demonstrated time and again to be right, as long as itrsquos on ldquoour side.Cameron Crawford, Rothesay.WHY SHOULD ISRAEL APOLOGISE THE Hamas charter commits to the annihilation of Israel no compromise. That is the obstacle to peace. Hamas has two weapons: rockets and disregard for the safety of its own in employing the deliberate emplacement of rocket launchers in residential districts, hoping to deter Israeli preventive retaliation or otherwise gaining the trump card, namely a greater number of Gazan fatalities and consequently the sympathy of the world for the ldquodisproportionality. Had it not been for Iron Dome Israel would likely have suffered , deaths.Should Israel apologise for not having sustained more fatalities M Green, Glasgow.THE DANGER OF ANARCHYTHE Green Party is urging Scots to \"actively resist\" the Home Office after tough immigration measures were announced . How totally irresponsible to encourage people to break the law. The law of the UK ndash and I might inform the Greens in case they had forgotten that we are still part of the UK ndash needs to be upheld or we will end up with anarchy.Catherine Taylor, Wishaw.CONCERN OVER ST VALERY IDEASPEAKING as the son of a Gordon Highlander captured at Saint Valery en Caux, I welcome the news that efforts are being made to make sure that the sts resistance in  will be remembered in future . However, I would make two points.First, the appropriate time for the authorities to have initiated this idea would have been when those of the st who were at the scene were alive. Many, like my father, died believing that their stand had been virtually ignored amidst the regular Dunkirk remembrances.Secondly, while I am hopefully wrong in this concern, I harbour doubts that the underlying reason for the belated recognition of the event is at least in part an effort to promote the Union in the face of the current increase in the cause of Scottish independence.Please do remember those who were there and others who fought against Nazi tyranny, but do it for the right reasons.Archie Hamilton, Glasgow.Read more: Half of Glasgow Hydro vaccine appointments were no shows over weekend"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12642877.jpg?type=article-full","title":"spirit-enterprise-six-best-scottish-gins-must-try","story":"----------------------------------------TROSSACHS DISTILLERYTrossachs Distillery in Callander, Scotland, overlooked by the majestic Ben Ledi, is the home of McQueen Gin, handcrafted with Passion, Honesty and Integrity.

ldquoscene from Independence Day and the Prime Ministerrsquos fiancee Carrie Symonds going ldquocompletely crackers over press coverage of her dog Dilyn.Boris Johnsonrsquos former chief adviser told MPs the country should have locked down the first week of March  at the latest but the ldquoofficial logic even on March  was that this would only cause a peak of the virus later on.He claimed the Governmentrsquos delay in locking down and lack of action plan was similar to  disaster film Independence Day in which the US is devastated by a surprise alien invasion, and compared his data expert colleague Ben Warner to Jeff Goldblumrsquos scientist in the film whose warnings were ignored.He told the committee of MPs the situation at the time was: ldquoThis is like a scene from Independence Day with Jeff Goldblum saying, lsquothe aliens are here and your whole plan is broken, and you need a new planrsquo.Mr Cummings said: ldquoOne of the critical things that was completely wrong in the whole official thinking, in Sage and in the Department of Health in February March was first of all the British public will not accept a lockdown, secondly, the British public will not accept what was thought of as a kind of East Asian style track and trace type system, and the infringement of liberty around that.ldquoThose two assumptions were completely central to the official plan and were both obviously completely wrong.Mr Cummings said he felt ldquomounting panic about the response and was pushing on March  and  for the Government to announce that iniduals should stay at homethey had symptoms and households should quarantine.But he said there was ldquopush back from within the system and ldquome and others were realising at this point the system is basically delaying announcing all of these things because therersquos not a proper plan in place.He added: ldquoAs far as I could tell from Sage, and as far as the minutes show, the fundamental assumption remained we canrsquot do lockdown, we canrsquot do suppression, because it just means a second peak.Mr Cummings said March  was a ldquocompletely surreal day, starting with him texting the Prime Minister at .am saying: ldquoWersquove got big problems coming.ldquoThe Cabinet Office is terryingly s***, no plans, totally behind the pace, we must announce today, not next week, lsquo you feel ill with cold or flu stay at homersquo.ldquoSome around the system wanted to delay because they havenrsquot done the work.ldquoWe must force the pace, wersquore looking at  to , deaths between optimistic and pessimistic scenarios.He said the day got derailed from dealing with Covid because in the morning ldquosuddenly, the national security people came in and said lsquoTrump wants us to join a bombing campaign in the Middle East tonightrsquohellip and we need to start having meetings about that through the day with Cobra as well. vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Cummings said a story about Boris Johnsonrsquos fiancee Carrie Symonds and dog Dilyn had been printed ldquoSo everything to do with Cobra that day on Covid was completely disrupted because you had these two parallel sets of meetings, you had the national security people running in and out talking about lsquoare we going to bomb the Middle East rsquohellip And then to add to it, it sounds so surreal it couldnrsquot possibly be true, that day The Times had run a huge story about the Prime Minister and his girlfriend and their dog, and the Prime Ministerrsquos girlfriend was going completely crackers about this story and demanding that the press office deal with that.ldquoSo, we have this sort of completely insane situation in which part of the building was saying, lsquoare we going to bomb Iraq rsquo, part of the building was arguing about whether or not wersquore going to do quarantine or not do quarantine, the Prime Minister has his girlfriend going crackers about something completely trivial.ldquoAnd you have all these meetings kind of going on through the course of the th.He said he had a meeting with advisers Ben and Marc Warner around pm ldquowhen they kind of hit the total panic button with me and they said, lsquowersquore looking at all this data, wersquore looking at all of these graphs, wersquore heading for a total catastrophe and we need to have Plan Brsquo.Mr Cummings said that on the evening of March  it was realised that a meeting would need to be held with Mr Johnson to explain ldquowersquore going to have to ditch the whole official plan, wersquore heading for the biggest disaster this country has seen since .Mr Cummings has tweeted a picture from this evening, which he called the ldquofirst sketch of Plan B, PM study, Fri   eve ndash shown PM Sat  .He said the ldquosecond most powerful official in the country at the time, Helen MacNamara, who was deputy cabinet secretary, walked into the room during the meeting with Ben Warner on March  and said: ldquoIrsquove just been talking to the official Mark Sweeney who is in charge of co-ordinating with the Department of Health. He said, quote, lsquoIrsquove been told for years that there was a whole plan for this. There is no plan. Wersquore in huge troublersquo. vw,vw,px, px\"Dominic Cummings during the evidence session to the joint inquiry of the Commons Health and Social Care and Science and Technology committees Mr Cummings said she told him: ldquoI think we are absolutely f*****, I think this country is headed for disaster, I think wersquore going to kill thousands of people.Mr Cummings said he told her: ldquoI think yoursquore right. I think it is a disaster.He said that on March , the Prime Minister was told: ldquoYou are going to have to lock down.But Mr Cummings added: ldquoBut there is no lockdown plan. Sage havenrsquot modelled it, DH donrsquot have a plan, we are going to have to figure out and hack together a lockdown plan.He added: ldquoThis is like a scene from Independence Day with Jeff Goldblum saying, lsquothe aliens are here and your whole plan is broken, and you need a new planrsquohellip that is what the scene was like that morning, with Ben Warner in the Jeff Goldblum role.ldquoHe took the Prime Minister through all the graphs, and through the NHS graphs, and showed him that the system is thinking this is all weeks and weeks and awayhellip but this is all completely wronghellip The NHS is going to be smashed in weeks.Mr Cummings said it was a ldquohuge failure on his own part that he did not push harder for an earlier lockdown.He said: ldquoI bitterly regret that I didnrsquot kind of hit the emergency panic button earlier than I did.ldquoI think, in retrospect, therersquos no doubt that I was wrong not to.He said he was ldquoincredibly frightened to say the official plan was wrong in case he himself was wrong.copy -.

I got stuck in Co Clare for Covid,” said Conni, who had been performing as a full-time harpist when the pandemic saw her ability to earn disappear overnight.“When it all happened we thought it would be a couple of weeks so I went there and figured it would be a nice place to hang out for a short while,” she said. “As it became more and more apparent that the music industry wasn’t going to be coming back in a hurry, I started looking at my other options and decided to go back to university.”While that may have seemed an easy decision to make, the reality of what she would be facing soon became apparent.“As I was at my parents’ home during Covid I’m not eligible for funding for university. If it wasn’t for the van then I just wouldn’t go as I’m not willing to take out a loan to pay for housing for four years.“I thought I have the van, why not  I can make this work.”Far from slumming it, Conni’s converted van comes equipped with a kitchen, living room and a bed.“It’s a big van. It’s kitted out with everything I need apart from a shower,” she said. “But I’m hoping to be able to use the facilities on campus at the university.”The only other obstacle is where to park it up when she is in the city.“The student’s union at UCD has already been in touch and will be trying to help arrange a parking permit,” she said.“That would be great. I’m hoping I can park there during the day and drive out and find somewhere to park it for the night.”She did admit to being wary of being branded as a ‘traveller’ though.“You don’t want people knocking on the door and asking you to move on,” she said.“I’ll try and be inconspicuous and not stay in any spot too long. I hope they’ll understand I’m a student who can’t afford anything .”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadVictim of notorious NI paedophile in plea for him never to be freedNorthern Ireland student faces four years in a camper van over Dublin rent costsBelfast Kam Yaun Chinese Bakery fined £, for food hygiene offences after mouse infestation foundEx-Alliance councillor who claimed ‘racist under-current’ in party before DUP defection dies suddenlyChannel  Father Ted racism warnings ‘disappointing,’ says creator Graham LinehanTop VideosPlayVideo: George Best son Calum says dad would have hated European Super league planPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayVideo: Doors open as Northern Ireland restaurants and pubs welcome customers inside againLatest Education‘Great day for children’ as MLAs back calls to ban pupil restraintPay teachers what they’re worth: unionMP urges Ulster University to seek an apology from Hall in wake of Di stormThe unassuming man who left Methodist College Belfast £m in his will Exams grading process a disaster waiting to happen, says SDLP’s McCrossanLatestDeclan BogueOpinionGAA could have prevented the injury pandemic sweeping county sidesRun up to first lockdown was like scene from Independence Day, Cummings claimsCompletely crackers that Boris Johnson is in power, says CummingsManchester City and Cha the latest all-English duel in Champions LeagueCha’s route to the Champions League final,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is the first full year where schools will be able to make use of this dedicated resource. Allocations will be made in the coming days.”Mr Weir said it was important that we continue to improve the experiences and outcomes for many of our most vulnerable children and young people.“The new Framework, combined with ongoing operational improvements by the Education Authority, will ensure effective special educational provision, whilst at the same time reducing unnecessary bureaucracy. This will result in a simpler and more responsive system to support our children with special educational needs, he said.The public consultation on new draft SEN regulations and a code of practice has finished and responses are currently being analysed.Any proposed changes to the draft regulations will be brought to the Assembly later in the year..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadVictim of notorious NI paedophile in plea for him never to be freedNorthern Ireland student faces four years in a camper van over Dublin rent costsEx-Alliance councillor who claimed ‘racist under-current’ in party before DUP defection dies suddenlyBelfast Kam Yaun Chinese Bakery fined £, for food hygiene offences after mouse infestation foundChannel  Father Ted racism warnings ‘disappointing,’ says creator Graham LinehanTop VideosPlayVideo: George Best son Calum says dad would have hated European Super league planPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayVideo: Doors open as Northern Ireland restaurants and pubs welcome customers inside againLatest Education‘Great day for children’ as MLAs back calls to ban pupil restraintNorthern Ireland student faces four years in a camper van over Dublin rent costsPay teachers what they’re worth: unionMP urges Ulster University to seek an apology from Hall in wake of Di stormThe unassuming man who left Methodist College Belfast £m in his will LatestDeclan BogueOpinionGAA could have prevented the injury pandemic sweeping county sidesIdentity of the unionist community ‘sacriced for the NI Protocol’Failure to establish abortion services ‘exercise in finger-pointing’, court toldNorwegian low-cost airline ‘has been saved’, says chief executiveWest End play starring Gemma Arterton resumes after Covid cancellation,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The licenses should be dependent on their ventilation meeting the required standards, he said.Dr Scally added it was essential hospitality venues were regarded as workplaces because “it’s the workers in those places who’ll be exposed to risk for the longest period of time.He also said it needs to be monitored, “particularly for places that need licensing and need inspection already”.New research shows opening windows would dramatically cut the risk of Covid- transmission in indoor workplaces, most notably those which attend to the public.Health experts and scientists believe a ventilation certicate would see establishments quickly regaining patrons’ trust, as well as employees ing with confidence to other enclosed buildings such as offices and shops.At present one in every  people in the pub-going population is believed to have the virus.“People tend to be sitting opposite each other, around or across tables,” said Prof Scally.“Alcohol makes people more chatty, and conversations rise in volume. There can be laughter and enjoyment — that’s why we go to these places.“Unfortunately, that just generates more virus transmission into the airsomeone’s infected and the issue of ventilation then becomes extraordinarily important.”Meanwhile, Dr Alan Stout, BMA Northern Ireland GP Committee chair, said most indoor areas will already have carried out risk assessments over adequate air flow and ventilation.But he added: “There needs to be some sort of checks on indoor facilities as well, to make sure that is the case.”Architects have also been advised that in the post-pandemic era buildings should be designed with ventilation high on the list of priorities, which isn’t always the case in countries with mild climates.Dr Stout added the reopening of indoor hospitality here “shows that we are in a good position, both in terms of infection numbers and, critically, in terms of vaccinating people, but it’ll still need to be a managed environment”. He said discipline around face coverings would be essential to the success of bringing people back indoors.“When you’re sitting at a table with other people you’ll be eating and drinking, so you won’t have a mask on,” he said.“But when you get up to move around, wearing one is going to be very important. That’s where you protect and prevent the spread of everybody  in that environment.”The Department for the Economy, which has produced ventilation guidance, was asked to confirm who is responsible for ensuring and enforcing it in workplaces. A response had not been received at time of going to print.

Destinations include Portugal, Israel, Iceland, Australia and New Zealand.However, today’s poll reveals many are still deeply reluctant to hop on a plane abroad any time soon.People were asked, once vaccinated, when they would consider a foreign holiday.Just % said they plan to head away in  — % may travel this summer while another % would consider an overseas trip later in the year.The vast majority , said it would be next year before they think about going abroad.Another % said it would be two or three years before a trip outside the UK or Ireland, while % have no plans to go overseas at any point.The remaining % were unsure or had no firm opinion.Fewer older people are willing to consider overseas travel this year. Just % would consider doing so — % this summer and % at any point this year. More than halfsaid it would be next year before they consider jetting off, while % would leave it two or three years.By contrast, almost halfof  to  year olds are considering heading overseas this year — with % hoping to get away in the next few months and % later in the year.

Another % said it would be next year.However, just over a quarter of females plan to holiday abroad in  — % this summer and % this year. Some % plan to leave trips to .It comes as a public health expert from Belfast warned against summer holidays — despite the traffic light system for foreign travel.Professor Gabriel Scally told holidaymakers to “beware” and also warned it is “irresponsible” to travel to other countries while potentially infected with a dangerous iant.Prof Scally, a member of independent Sage, said: “The regional director of the World Health Organization in Europe issued a statement in the last couple of days saying there shouldn’t be international travel and I would agree with that.“It is undesirable to have people holidaying in international resorts at this time for all sorts of reasons.“It isn’t necessarily safe to travel on airplanes, there was a flight between India and Hong Kong and there were  infections and they were only picked up because of quarantine in Hong Kong.“Flights are dficult, but it isn’t just the flights, it’s what happens at arrivals and departures with queues of people in restricted spaces.“You also have lots of people from dferent countries mixing together at foreign resorts.“If you think back a year, the virus came to the UK and Republic of Ireland by people ing from holidays.”He continued: “It’s important to remember that the vaccine isn’t the cure all.“There’s always the risk posed by iants and it’s irresponsible to go off to another country and potentially take a dangerous iant with you.”Prof Scally also criticised the traffic light system, saying: “We need a proper managed quarantine system for everyone arriving into the country.”The Department of Health and the Executive were contacted for comment.Yesterday an airline industry chief said people who have received both doses of the Covid- vaccine should not face restrictions when travelling to countries on the Government’s amber list.Willie Walsh, director-general of airline body Iata, said people should be allowed to make up their own minds about the risks of travelling to amber list destinationsthey have received their jabs.Those ing from countries on the Government’s amber list must quarantine at home for  days and take pre-departure and post-arrival tests.But Mr Walsh, who is the former chief executive of IAG — the parent company of British Airways — said amber restrictions should be the same as those for green list countries for fully vaccinated passengers.He told the Mail on Sunday: “People were promised the benefit of being vaccinated — a vaccine idend — and they should be given it.“I thinkyou’ve had both shots then there’s no argument you can make to say those restrictions can remain in place, and people should be free to decide for themselvesthey see any risk in travelling to a green or amber country,” the former IAG chief executive added.Belfast Most ReadVictim of notorious NI paedophile in plea for him never to be freedBelfast Kam Yaun Chinese Bakery fined £, for food hygiene offences after mouse infestation foundNorthern Ireland student faces four years in a camper van over Dublin rent costsEx-Alliance councillor who claimed ‘racist under-current’ in party before DUP defection dies suddenlyChannel  Father Ted racism warnings ‘disappointing,’ says creator Graham LinehanTop VideosPlayVideo: George Best son Calum says dad would have hated European Super league planPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash -

Credit: Liam McBurney PAAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMore than half of people in Northern Ireland believe parents should have the right to refuse a Covid vaccine for their children, our poll shows.The news comes after Northern Ireland’s vaccine roll-out opened to those aged  to  and a raft of Covid restrictions are lted from Monday.“This has been made possible because of the success of the vaccination programme and the majority of people acting on the public health advice,” Health Minister Robin Swann said.According to the Belfast -LucidTalk poll, % of respondents felt parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should not and % said they did not know, were not sure or had no opinion.The figures, however, y depending on the age and religious make-up of those who took part in the poll.Regarding  to  year-olds, a majorityfelt parents should not be able to turn down a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should and % didn’t know or had no opinion.Those aged  to , on the other hand, had starkly contrasting views. Some % said parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children and % said they should not. And % said they didn’t know, were unsure or had no opinion.Vaccines may be refused for a iety of reasons. For instance, earlier this year several countries temporarily halted the roll-out of the AstraZeneca jab due to concerns of rare blood clots.Due to evidence suggesting that younger people may be at greater risk of the extremely rare clots associated with the AstaZeneca vaccine, those in this age group can choose which vaccine to receive.The latest advice states that anyone under  can book a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, or they can make what the Department of Health has described as an “informed decision” and get the AstraZeneca jab at Belfast’s SSE Arena or at participating community pharmacies.More than one million people in Northern Ireland have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine to date.Looking at the religious make-up of those who took part in the poll, it is apparent that Protestants are more likely to feel parents should have a say over vaccinating their children than when compared to Catholics.Some % of Protestant respondents felt this way, while % felt they should not have the right to turn down a jab for their children and % had no opinion, were not sure or didn’t know.Of those designating as Catholic, % felt they should have the right to turn down a vaccine for their children and % did not. The remaining % said they didn’t know or were unsure.In terms of those of no religion, % were in favour of parents having this right and % did not. Some % weren’t sure or had no opinion on the matter.On Sunday the Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride urged everyone to get vaccinated. He said: “A Public Health England study has found the vaccines are highly effective. This underlines the need for people to come forward for their first and second doses as soon as they are available.”Belfast Most ReadVictim of notorious NI paedophile in plea for him never to be freedBelfast Kam Yaun Chinese Bakery fined £, for food hygiene offences after mouse infestation foundNorthern Ireland student faces four years in a camper van over Dublin rent costsEx-Alliance councillor who claimed ‘racist under-current’ in party before DUP defection dies suddenlyChannel  Father Ted racism warnings ‘disappointing,’ says creator Graham LinehanTop VideosPlayVideo: George Best son Calum says dad would have hated European Super league planPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayVideo: Doors open as Northern Ireland restaurants and pubs welcome customers inside againLatest CoronavirusCummings: PM thought Covid was ‘scare story’ and Whitty should inject him on TVCovid expert Gabriel Scally calls for ventilation certicates in all Northern Ireland workplaces Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageSmiles are back in Derry after the dark days of CovidNorthern Ireland hospitality trade welcomes customers indoors againLatestCigar butt discarded by Sir Winston Churchill fetches over £, at auctionCamilla hails David Hockney’s ‘glorious and uplting’ new workWhat is long Covid and how can I tellI’ve got it Declan BogueOpinionGAA could have prevented the injury pandemic sweeping county sidesBritain’s largest family puts Alton Towers through its paces before half-term,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

You could be forgiven for thinking officials want to make travel as dficult as possible.At the same time, the UK and the Republic of Ireland have two dferent traffic light lists which are constantly in flux, depending on the changing landscape in dferent countries around the world.For example, currently anyone flying into the Republic of Ireland from Canada or the US has to stay in managed quarantine, whereas anyone arriving into England from both countries only has to isolate at home for -days.There’s no obvious reason for the disparity and it certainly adds to the whole confusion around foreign travel and what is and isn’t safe.The desire for some summer sun after a long, miserable lockdown in Northern Ireland is understandable — but a holiday is even more of a necessity after trying to navigate the rules and advice relating to travel during a pandemic..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadVictim of notorious NI paedophile in plea for him never to be freedNorthern Ireland student faces four years in a camper van over Dublin rent costsEx-Alliance councillor who claimed ‘racist under-current’ in party before DUP defection dies suddenlyBelfast Kam Yaun Chinese Bakery fined £, for food hygiene offences after mouse infestation foundChannel  Father Ted racism warnings ‘disappointing,’ says creator Graham LinehanLatest Northern IrelandThree-quarters of adults have Covid- antibodies, data suggestsJames and Grace most popular baby names in Northern Ireland in Missing Belfast brothers found safe and well in Co TipperaryDeath of young child a ‘heartbreaking tragedy’Northern Ireland traffic alerts: Belfast Westlink reopened LatestDeclan BogueOpinionGAA could have prevented the injury pandemic sweeping county sidesBBC and Sky apologise after broadcasting Dominic Cummings swearVaradkar: Delay in ratying EU-Canada trade deal sends out wrong messageHealth Secretary Matt Hancock should have been fired, Dominic Cummings saysKyle Lafferty set to leave Killmarnock after relegation, says Tommy Wright,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Even with that procedure, doctors had warned his mother that his le was limited.Now, the future is bright — thanks to Graham and the incredible medics at the two hospitals.She said: If I was to say ‘thank you’ to Graham , times, it wouldn#t be enough but he knows how much we appreciate what he has done.He has saved Joshua#s le. It is as plain and simple as that. Without Graham, I don#t know what would have happened to Joshua because the tests that were done showed no one in the family had a kidney that was a good enough match.It is still early days but Joshua has been making incredible progress and it looks like the operation was a great success and we have the medical teams to thank for that too.It has been such a scary week, because although I was so excited that at last the operation was scheduled to go ahead, right up until the day of the operation it was one test after another. Graham#s kidney was shown to be a perfect match for Joshua at the start of this process but to make sure everything was still as perfect as they thought, these tests were repeated and repeated.Finally, they were sure and the operation went ahead and Joshua has been doing so well since, even though it is still early days.The medical team have been fantastic and have taken such good care of both Joshua and I, going far beyond what anyone would expect — his surgeon, after hearing that Joshua loves shortbread, even brought him in home made shortbread shaped like a boy and and his teddy bear.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePSNI Chief Inspector Graham Dodds FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePSNI Chief Inspector Graham DoddsMary said Graham is now her son’s hero.Joshua has always been obsessed with the police and it has been his ambition to be a police officer so it is such a wonderful coincidence that Graham is a police officer,” she added.Joshua was encouraged to give his kidney a name and he chose Hero because he said Graham is his hero.Joshua is hoping to be discharged from hospital back home to Enniskillen today, but will have to remain in isolation at home for a few weeks yet.Graham, who served as a Chief Inspector in Fermanagh and Omagh before moving onto a role based at Police Headquarters, said he is over the moon with how successful the transplant has gone so far.He is now encouraging others to consider registering as a live organ donor.The whole procedure from start to finish was amazing. Everything went so well and I was able to leave hospital the day after the operation,” he said.We have kept in touch throughout this whole process although it has mostly been remotely because of the importance to keep Joshua infection-free and the general Covid restrictions, but I think we are both looking forward to a proper meeting.A real bond had formed between Joshua and I, he is a great wee man and I feel privileged that I have been able to give him a future he can look forward to.When I saw that Mary needed a member of the public to consider becoming a live donor so her son could live, I didn’t hesitate in coming forward because this ties in with the reason I became a police officer in the first place.Since then, as I have gotten to know Joshua and have discovered just how amazing a little boy he is, my initial wish to help has only increased.He is an example of what can be achieved through organ donation. The path that was in front of him without a kidney donation wasn’t very bright or very long but that’s no longer the case. I cannot stress enough how important organ donation is — both after death and as a live donor.

The study concludes that any “united Ireland referendum” will need meticulous planning on how it should be carried out — and what would happen afterwards.Read MoreBelfastopinion poll: Northern Ireland#s changing political landscape as support for parties revealedThe study was carried out under the aegis of the constitution unit of University College London and the academic  stand well back from most of the complex and isive political issues, focusing mainly on procedural matters. The academics conclude that a border poll, as provided for in the  Good Friday Agreement, is not inevitable but could well happen in the wake of the  Brexit referendum and a potential re-run of the Scottish independence vote.The academics’ report, which is published today, lays huge stress on the need for preparations in good time for any such border poll. It says this must be driven by the London and Dublin governments and also involve all relevant groups in Ireland and Britain.The authors note the acrimonious fall-out after the June  UK-wide Brexit referendum with retrospective rows about funding and procedures to police fair play. Their report raises serious questions about the reliability of current referendum procedures in both the UK and Republic of Ireland jurisdictions.“The rules for referendum and election campaigns are badly out of date in both the UK and Ireland, and urgently need to be strengthened. This would be particularly important for referendums on the momentous unication question, where voters must be protected from misinformation, and have access to high-quality information,” the report warns.“The process as a whole must be fair, and its administration rigorously impartial,” they add.Other crucial issues which must be planned for include any wording for a referendum question, which the authors suggest could well be dferent in both jurisdictions. .app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Independent.ieMost ReadVictim of notorious NI paedophile in plea for him never to be freedBelfast Kam Yaun Chinese Bakery fined £, for food hygiene offences after mouse infestation foundNorthern Ireland student faces four years in a camper van over Dublin rent costsEx-Alliance councillor who claimed ‘racist under-current’ in party before DUP defection dies suddenlyChannel  Father Ted racism warnings ‘disappointing,’ says creator Graham LinehanTop VideosPlayVideo: George Best son Calum says dad would have hated European Super league planPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayVideo: Doors open as Northern Ireland restaurants and pubs welcome customers inside againLatest Northern IrelandThree-quarters of adults have Covid- antibodies, data suggestsJames and Grace most popular baby names in Northern Ireland in Missing Belfast brothers found safe and well in Co TipperaryDeath of young child a ‘heartbreaking tragedy’Northern Ireland traffic alerts: Belfast Westlink reopened LatestDeclan BogueOpinionGAA could have prevented the injury pandemic sweeping county sidesRun up to first lockdown was like scene from Independence Day, Cummings claimsCompletely crackers that Boris Johnson is in power, says CummingsManchester City and Cha the latest all-English duel in Champions LeagueCha’s route to the Champions League final,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Two wins from two is a pleasing start to their promotion challenge and McKaigue described their latest victory as a relatively disciplined performance. On a day when Derry scored - from play, he was pleased with his sides very clinical display in front of goal. “The goals changed the flow of the game, there is no doubt about that,” added McKaigue, who helped restrict Sean Quigley to a solidarity point from play. “We are under no illusions, we are still far from the finished article,” he also offered. Going the next step will only come with a run of games. He referred to a league semi-final that Derry have almost two feet in, with a score dference as good as an extra point on the table. googletag.cmd.push With Ulster champions Cavan coming down the tracks on Saturday, McKaigue expects no let up. “We have so much to work on and we havent had a huge amount of games.” he said. Then, factor in competition for places and his manager Rory Gallaghers outlook. “With the way Rory is, its a hard edge mentality and we try to win every game. We have to respect the other teams in the group and try to put our best foot forward.” McKaigue, who made his championship debut against Monaghan in , is the elder statesman of the team and the exciting young players coming into the fold were among the reasons why Derry backed themselves coming into Saturdays clash. googletag.cmd.push “Look at Ethan Doherty, look at Shane McGuigan, look at Conor Glass,” he points out. “We have Garethcoming from the back, Paudie Tadfully fit again and Paul Cassidy. “We have some pretty decent players coming through. They are starting to put their hand up and show they are inter-county footballers. “It showed in some of our attacking play, we were very slick and very clinical. We have a few things to tidy up on. We try to focus on ourselves, while giving the opposition the respect they deserve.” McKaigue is one of five current lists to have played in all four isions of the NFL, with Benny Heron the last to start a game in the top flight. The seven-point win over Cork at Owenbeg, in April , wasnt enough to stop Derry from the drop.     It was the last time the Oakleafers won a game in the Ulster championship, a competition McKaigue terms as unbelievably competitive. Winning matches of any kind and climbing the isions. Thats how he views the targets for the new-look Derry squad. “It has been two decent performances, but this group of players has still a bit to go, but the most important thing is winning games. Winning is the currency that matters in this sport. We want to compete and we want to win.” In terms of championship, Donegal and Tyrone have been around footballs top table and have knocked Derry out of the Ulster race. “I think our only focus is trying our very best to try and get out of Division . You want to ply your trade in a higher ision, then the championship takes care of itself. “There is no question about it, a good league campaign gives you great momentum for the championship. “We have nothing to concern ourselves with, only winning as many league games as possible to give us the best chance of preparing for a championship.” Suggesting crunch championship games Derry couldve won and you think of Mayo  and Tyrone , but McKaigue points to another. “The Tipperary gamewas a big one and we were very close to getting to the last  and they went on to the semi-final, to be narrowly beaten by Mayo. “Sometimes people think when youre beat in the Ulster championship, that the championship is over. Derry dont have a bad record in the qualiers, but we need to get a harder mentality to winning games and competing. “When you do that, then you can start talking about dferent rungs of the ladder. For us it is about Cavan and getting into a league semi-final andwe can get into that league semi-final, that is the first championship game of the year.” ALSO READ - Derry ease their way to victory over Fermanagh.

Staff from Rosemount Resource Centre have written a letter of no confidence to Derry City  Strabane District Council which questions the suitability of a ‘new management committee’. Ten workers who signed the no confidence letter say they have provided a collective  years’ service to the local community. A list of grievances and concerns are laid out in the letter over two and a half pages. They include allegations of bullying and harassment in the workplace, mis-use of funding, closed Annual General Meetings , concerns of ‘family collusion’ and a lack of knowledge in terms of financial reports. googletag.cmd.push In addition, it details the removal of committee members from an investigating  to ‘manipulate the outcome of grievances’, ‘victimisation’ of staff and exclusion of the community from decision-making. The letter says that all complaints can be backed up with emails, minutes and testimonials. “Staff are now feeling unhappy, vulnerable and threatened to be in their place of work. “This is having a devastating impact on our health, leading to us being unsure of what our future holds as community workers,” the letter adds. In conclusion, the staff say the situation will not be tolerated any more. The Derry News has since viewed correspondence from management which was sent to signatories of the ‘no confidence’ letter. googletag.cmd.push They have been called to an investigation in relation to their ‘participation in a letter sent to public representatives and others containing serious allegations’. It aims to establish facts and gather evidence relating to the allegations. Iniduals were given the right to trade union representation at the meeting or they can be accompanied by a colleague who is not involved in the investigation. Those invited to attend were told to keep the investigation confidential and thatthey breached that order it could be considered a disciplinary matter. Representing staff, Niall McCarroll of Unison said: “Workers at Rosemount Resource Centre should be valued as important stakeholders in how it is run and to ensure it meets the needs of the local community.”     Derry City  Strabane District Council was asked what action is being taken in relation to the allegations made. In response, a council spokesperson said that it is aware of concerns and is in the process of ‘collating and compiling information’ as part of a preliminary assessment of the situation. The spokesperson added that it would therefore be inappropriate to comment further at this time.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He waves a cursory greeting and continues on his way. In the time it takes me to gather everything I need together, he passes me again, his step count no doubt rising with every lap of the town. Zoom. Walk. Laptop. Bake. Netflix. Repetition has become endemic over the last year, but its something Moneymore cant be accused of. There is a unique feel to the fronts of the buildings that greet me as I walk around the town. Even the post office, now boarded up, remains unbranded. googletag.cmd.push Moneymores terrain gives the town a layered effect. The pillared entrance of The Manor House provides the backdrop to the towns mini roundabout, welcoming motorists coming down the hill from Smith Street. Rusty scaffolding frames a construction site on my left as I make my way down. A woman waters potted plants in her compact front garden. The distinctive smell of curry is emanating from the two Chinese restaurants at the bottom of the hill. Shutters are down on Antonios pizza, yet to open for the day. More scaffolding sits alongside buildings in mid-construction off High Street, but no work appears to be going on today. googletag.cmd.push Along Lawford Street there are ersion signs in place as Council staff busy themselves in resurfacing the Turnaface Road. The grating sound of the road roller echoes off the houses that line the street leading back to the town centre. You could describe Moneymore as ornate. Older, unique buildings, set at dferent levels, create a layered backdrop, crowned by the spire of St John and St Treas church on the top of the hill.  The hum of a small aircraft passing overhead and the unmistakable smell of freshly-cut grass adds to the sense of a town taking new-found pleasure in the mundane.     A pregnant sky threatens rain. Taken a dip I nip into The Mane Barber Shop, where a neon sign declares the shop open for business. Owner Pauline McGarvey is at her lunch. She says reopening has not been the silver bullet the industry was hoping for. “This week has been terrible. For the first seven days [after reopening] it was great, but its taken a dip again,” she tells me. “The older folk that keep you going – your pensioners and farmers and that during the day – they havent been about the same. A vintage tractor model welcomes visitors to the town from the Tyrone side. “It was a gamble coming into a small town. You do have a bit of passing trade but youre hoping people are going to come in from the likes of Coagh, Lissan and Loup. “I said I would give it six months and see how it turns. Its fine, but its not busy. You have that fear of whether its going to come back.” Pauline has been in Moneymore three years, and until the pandemic ruthlessly attacked all businesses, things had been going well.  has seen a seismic change across all industries, driving many hair and beauty professionals off the high street altogether. “Lots of people are working from home and I have to admit, Im tempted,” she says. “Youre still going to be hit with rates, and you havent stopped paying your water bill, your electricity, your rent. “Yes, we got a bit of help, butyouve no customers in, then that money is all going to go and you still have to find wages too. “Ive seen a lot of hair and beauty people who havent gone back from the first lockdown.” Humanity adapts though, and over the last year, Pauline has embraced the situation in which the world found itself. She got married in February, and has enjoyed the extra time with her family. Keeping an eye on litter in the area. “It was the first time in my le I could actually say I was a mummy. I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Connor Dorrity, a P pupil at St Marys PS, Maghera, first got involved when Maghera Cross Community Link, where he attends an after-school club, launched a community newsletter last year. The Maghera Hustle was met with approval throughout the community, with Connors interviews with local business owners catching the eye. “I was excited to interview them,” he told the County Derry Post. “I get random questions for random people. My favourite part would probably be meeting and talking to new people.” googletag.cmd.push Among the seven-year-olds interviewees was James Devlin, who owns Coopers Coffee Shop in the centre of the town. Their hospitality met with Connors approval. “We didnt get free coffee, but we did get free buns,” he said. “I knew him before the interview so it was quite cool to be interviewing him. I like talking to people I dont know though, because its a whole dferent experience. “My favourite person to interview was BSG Engineering, because I learned team work can make things awesome. “Im hoping to do some more interviews but I dont really know who yet. My mum and dad own a shop so I could interview them.” googletag.cmd.push County Derry Post  Derry Now journalist Liam Tunney met Connor last week for a wide-ranging chat. The archetypal people person, Connor is delighted to be out of lockdown and back chatting to people again. “It [the last year] has been dficult. The hardest part was going into lockdown, staring into the distance,” he said. “There were mountains, clouds, sky, people, theres a nice view from the house. Theres a park behind the house, in our back yard, so I usually play in it. “Id like to see more parks in Maghera because there is only one. There is a lot of interesting stuff in the town, but I would say the most interesting thing is the people.     “In lockdown, you didnt get to meet anyone, so this is a good opportunity to meet people. I missed everything about school and talking to people.” The project was launched by Maghera Cross Community Linkafter their work during the pandemic revealed a number of isolated members of the community. Heather Boyd, general manager of MCCL, said older isolated people in particular, enjoyed having something to read. “Older people that didnt have internet or the equipment or the want to have it, but they loved just having something to read, or the local news,” she said. “Local news is important, especially when people are stuck in the house the whole time. They still like to know whats happening on their doorstep. “Were not mentioned, its not about us. Covid is never mentioned in it anywhere.” One of Connors interviews in the Maghera Hustle. The Maghera Hustle has tried to appeal to all dferent age groups, with puzzles and colouring for children and old archive photos for older readers. It has helped the younger readers discover things happening in their town that they might never have had a chance to explore. “The first one was BSG, a business thats been in the town for so long, but the kids didnt really know what they did, whereas now they do,” said Heather. “It teaches them about what local businesses are doing and who runs them, but this was mostly about trying to help people that were too scared to come out of the house. “We put them in the food bags. We were delivering food bags to Lavey, Tobermore, Upperlands, all around and we put one in each bag. “We put some in the shops and schools, and we tried to make sure older people in the town got one through their letter boxes. “Connor is a great character and perfect for doing the reporting.” The young Maghera mans enthusiasm for the role is clear, and his infectious personality means he has a good chance of achieving his rather lofty ambitions. “There are a lot of people so we have lots of plans for interviews. By age , I will have completed this whole country,” he said. “I think it will be harder when Im older, because journalists have to do a lot of stuff. Id have to have a whole team working on it. “Its so exciting. This is the secret you cant get this experienceyoure a normal person, but its so fun meeting new people. “Its the best job in the whole world.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Connor Dorrity, a P pupil at St Marys PS, Maghera, first got involved when Maghera Cross Community Link, where he attends an after-school club, launched a community newsletter last year. The Maghera Hustle was met with approval throughout the community, with Connors interviews with local business owners catching the eye. “I was excited to interview them,” he told the County Derry Post. “I get random questions for random people. My favourite part would probably be meeting and talking to new people.” googletag.cmd.push Among the seven-year-olds interviewees was James Devlin, who owns Coopers Coffee Shop in the centre of the town. Their hospitality met with Connors approval. “We didnt get free coffee, but we did get free buns,” he said. “I knew him before the interview so it was quite cool to be interviewing him. I like talking to people I dont know though, because its a whole dferent experience. “My favourite person to interview was BSG Engineering, because I learned team work can make things awesome. “Im hoping to do some more interviews but I dont really know who yet. My mum and dad own a shop so I could interview them.” googletag.cmd.push County Derry Post  Derry Now journalist Liam Tunney met Connor last week for a wide-ranging chat. The archetypal people person, Connor is delighted to be out of lockdown and back chatting to people again. “It [the last year] has been dficult. The hardest part was going into lockdown, staring into the distance,” he said. “There were mountains, clouds, sky, people, theres a nice view from the house. Theres a park behind the house, in our back yard, so I usually play in it. “Id like to see more parks in Maghera because there is only one. There is a lot of interesting stuff in the town, but I would say the most interesting thing is the people.     “In lockdown, you didnt get to meet anyone, so this is a good opportunity to meet people. I missed everything about school and talking to people.” The project was launched by Maghera Cross Community Linkafter their work during the pandemic revealed a number of isolated members of the community.

Annarose Mullan, a Food Design and Nutrition graduate, launched Meadow Hill Garden Centre a few weeks ago, after finding her chosen career path blocked by last years Covid- lockdown. The -year-old enrolled in a horticulture course at CAFREs Greenmount campus, but the practical nature of her chosen course presented a dilemma. “It was dficult, but it was good at the same time,” she told the County Derry Post. “Everything had gone online. You didnt know your lecturers that well and you were trying to stay focused, but it was good because I was at the house and had no travelling to do. googletag.cmd.push “Thankfully, I was able to just jump straight outside and get to work in the garden, so it was good that way.” Annarose Mullan has been delighted with the response to her new business. The Ballerin womans career pivot was influenced by a long-held interest in gardening, fostered from a young age by her mother and grandmother. “I always had an interest in garden and was always out with my nanny and mammy,” she said. “Sometimes I had doubts, but it was always so natural to do it. I had a lot of support from my family and it was great to get into something over lockdown. googletag.cmd.push “I had experience in factories and office-type work, but I just didnt feel it was entirely for me, because I was going in when it was dark and coming home when it was dark. “It was monotonous, I like more iety, and the garden gives me that. Im meeting more people and its a lot nicer outside, for me anyway.” The garden centre provides a iety of plants and accessories, alongside a refill pottery service where customers can leave pots and containers to be filled. Some of the stock at Meadow Hill Garden Centre. Annarose says the last few weeks has been a busy time for her.     “Im kept busy with orders and there have been a lot of new customers coming in. Word-of-mouth and social media has been great for getting the word out there,” she said. “Its been great, theres been a lot of local support which Im so thankful for. A lot of people have been saying its lovely to come to and the feedback has been great.” More details on Meadow Hill Garden Centre can be found on their Facebook page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Annarose Mullan, a Food Design and Nutrition graduate, launched Meadow Hill Garden Centre a few weeks ago, after finding her chosen career path blocked by last years Covid- lockdown. The -year-old enrolled in a horticulture course at CAFREs Greenmount campus, but the practical nature of her chosen course presented a dilemma. “It was dficult, but it was good at the same time,” she told the County Derry Post. “Everything had gone online. You didnt know your lecturers that well and you were trying to stay focused, but it was good because I was at the house and had no travelling to do. googletag.cmd.push “Thankfully, I was able to just jump straight outside and get to work in the garden, so it was good that way.” Annarose Mullan has been delighted with the response to her new business. The Ballerin womans career pivot was influenced by a long-held interest in gardening, fostered from a young age by her mother and grandmother. “I always had an interest in garden and was always out with my nanny and mammy,” she said. “Sometimes I had doubts, but it was always so natural to do it. I had a lot of support from my family and it was great to get into something over lockdown. googletag.cmd.push “I had experience in factories and office-type work, but I just didnt feel it was entirely for me, because I was going in when it was dark and coming home when it was dark. “It was monotonous, I like more iety, and the garden gives me that. Im meeting more people and its a lot nicer outside, for me anyway.” The garden centre provides a iety of plants and accessories, alongside a refill pottery service where customers can leave pots and containers to be filled. Some of the stock at Meadow Hill Garden Centre. Annarose says the last few weeks has been a busy time for her.     “Im kept busy with orders and there have been a lot of new customers coming in. Word-of-mouth and social media has been great for getting the word out there,” she said. “Its been great, theres been a lot of local support which Im so thankful for. A lot of people have been saying its lovely to come to and the feedback has been great.” More details on Meadow Hill Garden Centre can be found on their Facebook page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

According to local folklore, a dog belonging to the OCahan clan jumped the River Roe to get help from nearby clans following a surprise attack. Former principals Mr Glenn Reilly, Mr David Dunlop and Mr Shane Laverty joined current incumbent Mr Darren Mornin for the statues unveiling last week.

Following Mr Floyds death protestsagainstpolice brutality, especially towards black people, quickly spread across the United States and globally, and led to the formation of the Black Lives Matter campaign. Among those in attendance at todays event, organised by the North West Migrants Forum , held in Guildhall Square, was Brian Tierney, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council who took the knee with LilianSeenoi Barr, from NWMF, in a show of support for the Black Lives Matter campaign. googletag.cmd.push Also in attendance were local councillors, Mary Durkan from the SDLP and Shaun Harkin from People Before Profit. Cllr Harkin said: “Floyds death put a spotlight on the terrying arrogance of US police forces who routinely kill people of colour with the knowledge theyll get away with it, even when it happens in broad daylight with people challenging them and recording their brutality. “Floyds murder also put a spotlight on the vicious poverty the vast majority of Black and other people of colour continue to face in the US, even after decades of civil rights legislation. “The Black Lives Matter rebellion in the US sparked a global movement challenging police violence and institutional racism. Without this movement there would have been no accountability for George Floyds murder. There would be no discussion about the need to challenge the pervasiveness of structural racism. No matter what the political establishment says, people power is the key to bringing change.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Gary Rutherford founded ARC Fitness – Addiction Recovery Coaching just over two years ago and since then the organisation has grown exponentially. As part of a ‘No Shame’ campaign, which seeks to end the stigma associated with addiction, Gary is this week running five marathons while wearing a lb weighted vest. The vestsymbolises the heavy burden of shame that people suffering from addiction can so often feel. Gary started his challenge yesterday and today completed his second marathon. googletag.cmd.push There will be a dferent route every day allowing the ARC community to participate in three and four-mile loops. In chronological order for each day, runs will commence at Gransha Park, the quay at Sainsbury’s, Gasyard Centre, Ebrington Square and the day  run will start and finish at Guildhall Square. Speaking to the Derry News earlier this week about the gruelling task, Gary says: “I’ve run five marathons before, but I ran them in  months. “The driver of this is that lockdown came, everything closed, and I wasn’t a fan of training in my living room. So I started running again. googletag.cmd.push “I got a weight vest for Christmas, as you do, so I thought I would use that as symbolism. “I’ve never taken on anything like it I’m not sure how it’s going to feel, I’m sure it’s not going to be comfortable, but, you know what, I’ve been through worse.” On raising awareness, he adds: “This was just a way of us formalising what we do all the time anyway. “I fully get how shame and blame and judgement stops people from accessing help, whether it’s a person or families who are struggling with somebody. “For us it was a way of helping people to tackle that stigma and have conversations about something that is right in front of your nose.     “To do it in a way where there is no judgement becauseyou do that sooner then maybe people don’t have to make the mistakes that I did for example.” HEALTH  Gary battled with addiction for  years and was fortunate not to sever his spine after suffering a broken back in a  car accident. With a focus on physical and mental health, he recovered and ‘rebuilt’ his body. Gary reflects: “I struggled with addiction for a long time, I will be clean and sober  years in August. I went in and out of treatment for rehabilitation and had hospital issues. “I lived through the destruction of it all, so I have a full understanding of that le. “I joined a running club, I hated it it was awful and hard. I was so unfit,  and a half stone, I had broken my back in  – my body was wrecked. “But I really stuck at it and started developing that love for exercise and running. “And then there were the benefits of all that: physical and mental health, self-confidence and self-esteem which was really, really important. “So I always wanted to find a way to work with people who were struggling with substance mis-use and bring the exercise aspect of it in. “I wanted to offer that to other people to raise them up again.” A goal was set to help others going through the same troubles. ARC was established when Gary, a registered mental health nurse and a qualied PT, wanted to sign-post people to mental health support, addiction services and reputable trainers. After deciding that he could provide the service himself, ARC was registered as a not-for-profit organisation and snowballed from there. A six-week physical activity programme was organised for a small group as a way of testing the waters. By the end of those six weeks, Gary identied a building where he could run the programme. He remains at Distillery Brae in the Waterside area where they now have a waiting list due to ever increasing demand. NATIONWIDE PROJECT The business has gone from strength to strength and now has a team of  professionals, who specialise in dferent areas. However, of most import to Gary is that they’re all non-judgemental iniduals capable of understanding and relating to their clients. People come to them for support with a broad spectrum of issues, from mild to severe for some addiction leads to strained family relationships, complex mental health issues and the loss of employment. As someone who only immersed himself in fitness in his s, Gary is also an example that it’s never too late to start. “People think they have to join a gym. But we do a lot of wellness workshops it’s about sitting down less and moving more. “It can be walking, it doesn’t have to be what I do, it’s about finding something you enjoy. “That’s why we offer indoor climbing, running therapy sessions, strength training, mindfulness. We try to offer a iation of activities,” he says. Moving forward, Gary has plans to expand the business, to reach out to families and workplaces in order to change the misconceptions linked to addiction. Working with Learning Pool they are also examining how an online educational academy can be delivered to people across the country.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Douglas Walker has worked as a hospitality and catering lecturer at the local college for  years. He spent his final day working for the college being reunited with two of his former students, Noel Ward and Andrew Taylor, based at the White Horse Hotel in Campsie. Retirement now beckons for Douglas, following a ied career in which he has worked in restaurants and hotels in countries across Europe. His final destination was NWRC, where he has dedicated three decades to training up new generations of chefs, bakers, pacirctissiers, and chocolatiers. googletag.cmd.push Douglas looks back on a career in which he and his colleagues have worked to forge strong and sustainable connections with local employers, building new careers and strengthening the local economy. “The best thing I have found about teaching is giving students the opportunity to go and work in the industry,” said Douglas. “I’m happy to meet up again with my former student Noel Ward, who has been head chef of the White Horse Hotel for  years, and Andrew Taylor, who has worked hard and is now junior sous chef at the hotel. “These college and employer connections have been extremely important for the growth of the Hospitality sector. googletag.cmd.push “We’ve also been fortunate over the years to send our students to Michelin Starred restaurants like Le Manoir and Gidleigh Park, Devon. “We have also sent four students to the Institute for Ireland Leuven, Belgium, which has given them a great experience in the industry.” After training as a chef in the s, achieving his City  Guild qualications, Douglas travelled to London to work as a commis chef and joined a group of hotels. He later gained his qualications in teaching and went on to work in Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Switzerland before ing to Northern Ireland to work at the Glen House Hotel, Eglinton.     “I had always thought about moving into teaching, and I enjoyed passing on my knowledge to others,” said Douglas. “I started teaching part-time at NWIFHE as it was then in  and I was also teaching Magee’s Ulster University nd year Hotel and Tourism students in their fine dining restaurant Martha Magee’s. “I think I have taught every age range of students that came to NWRC, from School Links, Year  students preparing for le at University, Cookery for Entertainment which included adults from  to , Princes Trust, SEN students in both Strabane and the Strand Road campus and also a large number of adults in the community as far away as Sion Mills and Dungiven. “I’ve also taught the Professional Cookery Course, Professional Chef’s Diploma, and the NVQ Level -, as well as running NWRC’s Flying Clipper fine dining restaurant kitchen on a Wednesday lunch and a Thursday evening. “I enjoyed teaching the Food Production Breads and Pastry Level - courses, and the hugely popular Chocolate skills courses. “I have always had an interest in desserts, and as part of ‘Lecturers into Industry,’ I spent some time in the Pastry section at Le Manoir aux Quat Saisons and Raymond Blanc’s  Michelin Starred restaurant and hotel near Oxford. Since then I have managed to secure many work placements in the kitchens there for NVQ Level  students and also for a lecturer in our department. “As a result of the contacts made, we organised a NI-wide College competition at NWRC’s Northland Road kitchens, judged by Mark Peregrine, head of the cookery school at Le Manoir. “We always enjoy competition work in our department and we’re incredibly proud of the students who got through to the regional heats of the Toque d’ dor in Birmingham.” Married to Ann for  years, and with three grown-up sons, Douglas says he’s looking forward to spending more time with his grandchildren and taking on some voluntary work following his retirement. “I retire from NWRC with many happy memories,” he said. “I send my best to my colleagues as they continue to train and nurture our students. I would strongly recommend a career in Hospitality and Catering to any young person as it offers so many opportunities and although the work can be challenging at times, it will lead to a very interesting and rewarding career.” Kathleen McCaul, Department Head of Hospitality and Catering at NWRC said: “We wish Douglas all the best for his retirement and we thank him for the many years he has given to the college. “The work he has put into moulding our young talent in the field of hospitality and catering cannot be underestimated. His skills, dedication, and passion for the job will be missed.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Coyle’s paradise location in Cancun turned into a nightmare as he found himself fighting, not in an air-conditioned stadium, but ‘literally a street in Mexico’, as rain poured down from overhead, eventually stopping his bout with Edgar Ortega after six rounds. The Derry middleweight was ahead on the scorecards at the end of the sixth round when the fight had to be stopped due to persistent rain and he was awarded the victory and the ABF Continental Americas Middleweight title. googletag.cmd.push The contest took place in the courtyard of a Cancun hotel, but after days of glorious sunshine leading up to the fight, the heavens opened. It rained from the first round on and despite efforts to mop the canvas at the end of the fth and sixth rounds, the decision was made to end the contest. It went to the scorecards – and at that stage, Coyle was up -, -, and - and declared the winner. Despite the victory, Coyle felt no satisfaction at the way the event panned out. “It was a bad experience,” he said. “Our plan was to get the rounds under the belt and take him into the later rounds so I was pacing myself and planning to pick it up in rounds seven, eight and nine. googletag.cmd.push “The rain didn’t help and it just kept getting heavier and heavier. They had to stop it after round five to mop the ring and brush all the water off the ring, but in round six it just kept getting heavier and heavier so they had to call the fight and go to the scorecards. It was an experience I didn’t ever want to encounter again in my professional career.” Coyle knew early on that he had a problem as the rain did not let up, and he had to change his gameplan entirely mid-fight. “I was trying to punch but my feet were slipping from underneath me,” he explained. “It was hard to dig my feet in and punch properly and punch hard. Any time I tried to move and punch my feet were slipping so it was a dficult experience but we did enough and we got through it, but I don’t ever want to go it again.”     Opponent Ortega has taken the likes of Carlos Molina the distance, so Coyle was looking forward to the challenge, but his hopes of knocking out a durable opponent never came to fruition because of the farcical surroundings. “I was pacing myself because I knew he was fit and I was fighting outside in the Mexican heat which he was used to, and he knew he could go ten rounds in the heat,” he continued. “I thought I was going to be fighting inside in an air-conditioned building but we pulled up to a bloody courtyard with just walls. It was literally in a street in Mexico it was bloody terrible. I wanted to pace myself work off the jab and see what he brought in the later rounds, but the rain interrupted.” ‘Fight him at his own game’ Coyle was getting on top of his opponent despite the rain, proving that he can mix it up when necessary. He felt he was free and clear when it went to the score cards, but nothing was ever certain on a night like this. “My punches were a lot harder and my punches were clean,” he reflected. “They were a lot cleaner than his. Because I couldn’t move so well in the ring I had to fight him at his own game. I had to block his shots, but not a lot were getting through a lot of them were on the back of the head and the ear, but that’s just his experience and craft as a seasoned professional. My shots were a lot cleaner and they were scoring punches, so when it went to the score cards I got the victory.” The Mexican experience is now behind him and there it will stay, the frustration only making him more determined to get back into the United States as soon as possible. “I’m not happy with the way everything went,” he admitted. “Both my experiences in Mexico have been terrible. The only good thing is that I got two fights and I have two wins. I’m going to go home and regroup and talk to my coaches and see what is next. “I need to get back into Florida. I need to get back in there for an - training camp for my next fight, because I need to get away and I need to be focused and %. It’s dficult to do that at home because there are a lot of distractions. “We’ve been speaking with the NEBF so they are going to get me onto the rankings for the end of the month so hopefully I will be fighting for the NEBF title when I get back to America. I don’t know  “I’m going to fight again now until I get back into America. I’m happy enough with those two fights just to get the ball rolling again and to build the record more. I’ll never be back in Mexico fighting again, that’s for sure. I took a chance both times coming to Mexico, especially going to the score cards against a home town opponent but I did enough to win.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Coyle’s paradise location in Cancun turned into a nightmare as he found himself fighting, not in an air-conditioned stadium, but ‘literally a street in Mexico’, as rain poured down from overhead, eventually stopping his bout with Edgar Ortega after six rounds. The Derry middleweight was ahead on the scorecards at the end of the sixth round when the fight had to be stopped due to persistent rain and he was awarded the victory and the ABF Continental Americas Middleweight title. googletag.cmd.push The contest took place in the courtyard of a Cancun hotel, but after days of glorious sunshine leading up to the fight, the heavens opened. It rained from the first round on and despite efforts to mop the canvas at the end of the fth and sixth rounds, the decision was made to end the contest. It went to the scorecards – and at that stage, Coyle was up -, -, and - and declared the winner. Despite the victory, Coyle felt no satisfaction at the way the event panned out. “It was a bad experience,” he said. “Our plan was to get the rounds under the belt and take him into the later rounds so I was pacing myself and planning to pick it up in rounds seven, eight and nine. googletag.cmd.push “The rain didn’t help and it just kept getting heavier and heavier. They had to stop it after round five to mop the ring and brush all the water off the ring, but in round six it just kept getting heavier and heavier so they had to call the fight and go to the scorecards. It was an experience I didn’t ever want to encounter again in my professional career.” Coyle knew early on that he had a problem as the rain did not let up, and he had to change his gameplan entirely mid-fight. “I was trying to punch but my feet were slipping from underneath me,” he explained. “It was hard to dig my feet in and punch properly and punch hard. Any time I tried to move and punch my feet were slipping so it was a dficult experience but we did enough and we got through it, but I don’t ever want to go it again.”     Opponent Ortega has taken the likes of Carlos Molina the distance, so Coyle was looking forward to the challenge, but his hopes of knocking out a durable opponent never came to fruition because of the farcical surroundings. “I was pacing myself because I knew he was fit and I was fighting outside in the Mexican heat which he was used to, and he knew he could go ten rounds in the heat,” he continued. “I thought I was going to be fighting inside in an air-conditioned building but we pulled up to a bloody courtyard with just walls. It was literally in a street in Mexico it was bloody terrible. I wanted to pace myself work off the jab and see what he brought in the later rounds, but the rain interrupted.” ‘Fight him at his own game’ Coyle was getting on top of his opponent despite the rain, proving that he can mix it up when necessary. He felt he was free and clear when it went to the score cards, but nothing was ever certain on a night like this. “My punches were a lot harder and my punches were clean,” he reflected. “They were a lot cleaner than his. Because I couldn’t move so well in the ring I had to fight him at his own game. I had to block his shots, but not a lot were getting through a lot of them were on the back of the head and the ear, but that’s just his experience and craft as a seasoned professional. My shots were a lot cleaner and they were scoring punches, so when it went to the score cards I got the victory.” The Mexican experience is now behind him and there it will stay, the frustration only making him more determined to get back into the United States as soon as possible. “I’m not happy with the way everything went,” he admitted. “Both my experiences in Mexico have been terrible. The only good thing is that I got two fights and I have two wins. I’m going to go home and regroup and talk to my coaches and see what is next. “I need to get back into Florida. I need to get back in there for an - training camp for my next fight, because I need to get away and I need to be focused and %. It’s dficult to do that at home because there are a lot of distractions. “We’ve been speaking with the NEBF so they are going to get me onto the rankings for the end of the month so hopefully I will be fighting for the NEBF title when I get back to America. I don’t know  “I’m going to fight again now until I get back into America. I’m happy enough with those two fights just to get the ball rolling again and to build the record more. I’ll never be back in Mexico fighting again, that’s for sure. I took a chance both times coming to Mexico, especially going to the score cards against a home town opponent but I did enough to win.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Back in December, the former Oakleaf man had to dig deep in far from ideal circumstances to win against Jan Ardon on his pro debut. It was not the dream night that McGinty had envisaged all things considered, but fast forward six months and he made sure that everything went right. The added bonus of fans in attendance only boosted McGinty further and he gave them something to cheer about as he dominated Dwain Grant to record a unanimous points victory after four rounds. googletag.cmd.push McGinty achieved the margin by using his jab, but especially good shots to the body throughout and after the fight he was much more satisfied than he was in December, knowing he had performed well, despite the late change in opponent. “This felt like the debut I never had,” he told Seconds Out. “It is a weird experience fighting in front of nobody, hearing the slap of the shots the only positive is that you can hear the corner better. It was a great feeling walking out and hearing the Irish crowd for the first time as a pro you would have thought there was a lot more of them here than there was, but that was them making a lot of noise. googletag.cmd.push “I’m really happy with it. It was a lot better performance than on my pro debut. I was talking all week about improving every day and I think that showed.

Sometimes I was maybe waiting too long and then giving him a chance to move off, which can be worked on and which can be improved upon. There were definitely improvements all round and things to take with me going forward.”  Looking forward So enthused was he by his performance against Grant that McGinty is already looking forward to getting into the ring again. Six months passed by between his first and second bouts, but the St. Johnstone man could well be back in action a lot sooner. Coaches Mick Hennessey and Ricky Hatton have worked hard with McGinty in recent months and they were more than happy with their boxer’s display, the -year-old learning every day as he takes his first step in his professional career. “Mick said to me that all being well I’ll be out again on July  and that’s what I want, I want that momentum again, a run of fights and hoping to win, which you do in the amateurs,” McGinty added. “Hopefully now that’s the start of it. My next fight is eight weeks to the day so I’ll take a week off, get back on the wagon again and hopefully get to - and hopefully march on. “Ricky and Blaine both said that they couldn’t fault me on the performance. To be honest, I did feel that I got him a couple of times to the body, especially in the second round. He was very honest afterwards we spoke after the fight and he said to me that he felt it. The bell went a few seconds later then before I could capitalise on it.

That was the last we heard from him.ldquoI was listening to the news all afternoon to hearthere was anything happening. It wasnrsquot until pm that night when I was listening to the RTE news that I heard a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy.Mr Mullan knew in his gut that it was his brother, but could not bring himself to tell his parents, John and Mary.ldquoAll that was said that he was shot, it didnrsquot say he was dead. He was actually dead within  minutes of being shot, he continued.ldquoWe were phoned around am and I found out he was dead. I called the doctor just in case my mother would get badly upset and she was badly upset after the doctor told her. I couldnrsquot bring myself to tell her.ldquoMy father was up the stairs and couldnrsquot come down the stairs but he knew it was bad news.Mr Mullan said it took the Ballymurphy families a few years to organise in order to campaign for truth and justice as a  inquest recorded an open verdict in all the deaths.He has been involved with the campaign for a new inquest for over  years, travelling to Dublin and Brussels and beyond on order to plead the familiesrsquo case.Mr Mullan, his niece Geraldine McGrattan and son Hugh had been regular attenders over the  days the inquest was held.The family, including Mr Mullanrsquos late sister Teresa, lived for a time on the Strand, beside the Portaferry Hotel.While Mr Mulllan took after his father and spent his working le fishing, Fr Mullan spent a year in the Merchant Navy before opting to go to Queenrsquos University and then Maynooth College to train to be a priest.He served for a time at St Josephrsquos Church in Killough before moving to Dunloy for nine years.

This means that plastic litter in the sea is just adding up and, globally, we are adding a truck load full every minute, she continued.ldquoThat is a lot of plastic and, on top of looking bad, it is harmful to sea plants and animals. Every year, plastic kills , sea animals and over a million sea birds. It is a big problem.During last weekrsquos launch event in Ardglass, a number of fishermen told Jenny how sad they were to see how much litter is in the sea and that they have noticed an increase in the amount of it in during their letimes.ldquoIt also takes their valuable time at sea to clear from their nets and can potentially contaminate their catch, so the new scheme is a win-win for them to do their part in getting rid of it.Describing the new project as ldquoinnovative, Jenny said it has already been successful where with fishermen bringing marine litter caught in their nets back to shore.She said the Harbour Authority provides durable bags for the litter to be collected in and that once landed onshore, it is sent off to be recycled or otherwise disposed of.ldquoThis is how our fishermen in Northern Ireland are reducing the marine plastic problem at sea, Jenny explained. ldquoThe thing that makes this project so unique is that fishermen are almost the only people who have access to litter that is out in the open water or at the seabed.ldquoStopping waste entering the sea is imperative, but taking litter out of the sea is too, even though it is more challenging. That is exactly what lsquofishing for litterrsquo fishermen do.Jenny praised the fishermen in Ardglass who have signed up to the scheme as did local councillor, Dermot Curran.ldquoThis is a great scheme and anything which can help reduce the amount of marine litter being washed ashore is to be welcomed, he said.ldquoTen Ardglass skippers have already signed up for the scheme and I hope that there will be more. This is a great new initiative but we also have to look at how litter gets into the sea in the first place which poses problems for trawler skippers as this waste gets tangled up in their nest which is time-consuming and a distraction they could well do without, he said.ldquoThe Fishery Harbour Authority is to be congratulated for bringing this initiative to the Co Down ports and the more skippers that sign up for lsquofishing for litterrsquo the better. The scheme can help protect the environment and reduce the amount of unsightly litter being washed up along the shoreline..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business support programme helps secure 78 jobs in district  ","story":"A COUNCIL-LED local business support programme has created  jobs in the last  months.According to new figures released, the Business Growth and Tender for Growth programmes facilitated by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council have helped to create an average of one new job each week.The programmes are part-funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern Irelandprogramme.Despite the impact of recent lockdowns over the last  months, NMD Business has continued to provide SMEs with support packages in response to challenges created by the pandemic.This has resulted in ongoing growth for the business and the creation of  new job roles, as well as helping  businesses involved in the programme to navigate an unprecedented economic environment.Participants in the programme are able to avail of one-to-one mentoring from leading experts, who help guide them and their business through unprecedented times, as well as learning new skills in financial management, cross-border sales and maximising your chances of winning tenders.As a result, many businesses have been able to not only grow their business, but grow their workforce.Sara Velasquez, from Ecoplastic in Downpatrick, completed the programme last year and has already recruited four new staff for the business.Her firm designs and makes all kinds of structures from % recycled material, from boardwalks to street furniture, bridges to bike trails and picnic tables.She said: ldquoThe NMD Business programme helped us focus on the most lucrative areas for growth for our business.ldquoOur dedicated mentor provided us with expert guidance which allowed us to respond quickly to a new market environment, giving us confidence that decisions we were taking were anchored in good commercial sense, while the workshops equipped us with new skills that will stand us in good stead into the future.ldquoSales have since increased as a result and we continue to work on exciting projects across Ireland and the UK.

It was a four-lap course which started at Greenisland Golf Club and carried on via Monkstown Wood, Shore Road and then a bit of a challenge with a hill to contend with on Station Road.The weather was grey with a little drizzle but nothing to cause major problems and in fact Declan felt that there was a slight wind assistance on the climb which was welcome.The overall winner Chris Denton, was the only runner to break three hours and he took top spot on the podium with a time of two hours and  minutes.Declan was more than happy with his own time of . and the fact that he placed seventh overall.

This is especially true of local access to emergency care.Mr Hazzard said many were acutely aware that the Department of Health will soon launch a review of urgent and emergency care, suggesting that given the soundings to date from both health minister Robin Swann and the South Eastern Trust, there will be concern across the community that this will have ldquomajor ramications for the delivery of emergency medicine in small rural hospitals like the Downe.ldquoWith this in mind, it is vital that our local community and health workers are afforded an opportunity to be proactively involved in determining the most appropriate model of healthcare at the Downe, the MP declared.ldquoI was encouraged to hear the health trust recognise that communication and dialogue need to improve in the time ahead and that elected representatives, trade unions and community health activists can play a constructive role in partnership with officials in delivering for the Downe.Mr Hazzard said this would not only enable the local community to benefit from regular public engagement and consultation but, perhaps most importantly, would ensure a real andmeaningful process of co-design with staff and their trade union representatives.He added: ldquoI look forward to hearing back from the South Eastern Trust in the weeks ahead as to how this partnership forum can be established and will once again endeavour to work in partnership with all local political parties, staff representatives, and the Down Community Health Committee.News of the proposal for the establishment of the new health forum involving the public and health workers comes after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to involve local health campaigners in a a major new offensive to ensure that the Downpatrick hospital continues to deliver key services.In April, politicians paved the way for the Down Community Heath Committee to join them in key discussions about the future of the Downpatrick hospital which they say has a critical role to play in delivering key services for people across the South Eastern Trust area in a post-Covid world..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Hurlers.jpg","title":"Hurlers rally to win over Carlow  ","story":"DOWN hurlers showed they still have plenty to fight for after they secured a rallying comeback win inspired by their talisman Paul Sheehan against Carlow.Following last weekendrsquos defeat to Kerry, Ronan Sheehanrsquos men knew they had to put on a show at Ballycran in order to avoid an early indication of relegation.The contest was worthy of a crowd, as the action-packed affair exploded from the first whistle when Carlowrsquos Kevin McDonald put his side a goal up within the opening minute.The away side piled on relentless pressure to inflict further damage on the Down side as the points gap began to widen.However, as per the usual story, star man Sheehan began picking up the pieces and alongside Caolan Taggart and Daithi Sands, Down began to let Carlow know they werenrsquot here to just fill up the numbers.The away team lost their goal advantage on the half-hour mark when the ever dangerous Conor Woods cracked home a thumping penalty to tie the scores.Sheehan ensured Down entered the half-time break on top, scoring three points in two minutes to help his side lead -

There will also be increased emphasis on ensuring that public toilets meet the needs of those with autism, dementia and other health conditions.The new toilet strategy mdash which includes a review of how council-owned toilets are managed, cleaned and maintained mdash is expected to be formally signed off at tonightrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Across the district, the local authority is responsible for  public conveniences, many of which have been in place for over  years and are showing signs of corrosion and internal wear and tear. A number have also been vandalised.Councillors will be told tonight that a decision is required to repair, replace or remove these particular units and they will be provided with a detailed breakdown of the work that is required.Toilets at Castlewellanrsquos Upper Square need to be replaced while the outer shell of the building would remain in place, while the existing facility at Market Street in Downpatrick would be entirely replaced.The new strategy suggests that the current public toilets at The Rocks in Ballyhornan would be replaced as would existing toilets at the local authority-owned car park at the Newcastle Road outside Dundrum.Plans have also been drawn up to replace toilets at Crossgarrsquos Lislea Drive and at Ardglass harbour, while public toilets at the New Line in Saintfield mdash which have been repeatedly targeted by vandals mdash would replaced, alongside those at the Quoile Road in Downpatrick.Public toilets the Lough Inch cemetery in Ballynahinch and Struell Cemetery in Downpatrick are also in line for refurbishment under the new council strategy, alongside conveniences at Windmill Street in Ballynahinch.It will also be confirmed at tonightrsquos council meeting that almost  people responded to a -week consultation on the new strategy with over  percent of those who responded agreeing with the suggestion to pay to spend a penny. Concern was also expressed about the cleanliness of some public toilets and their layout.And while council toilets in Newcastle, Dundrum, Castlewellan, Downpatrick, Ballyhornan and Ardglass have reopened after being closed due to coronavirus, those in Saintfield, Ballynahinch, Crossgar and Killyleagh remain closed.

It is celebrated on Sunday, May .In their joint message, the bishops opened by quoting a verse from the book of Acts in the Bible: \"All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability - Acts :.\"They continued: \"One of the great marks of the first Pentecost was the ability the Holy Spirit gave the apostles to speak across barriers of language of the works of God.ldquoThe Spirit today gives the people of God the same ability to speak as one across all kinds of barriers and boundaries.ldquoWe rejoice today that we can speak together to both our church communities and beyond with a common message of hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\"Stating their disappointment that for a second year they are unable to mark this \"great feast\" by coming together for their Ecumenical Service of Prayer, as they have done for almost  years, the bishops added: \"This service allows us to give thanks and praise together to God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Please God, next year this might again be possible.\"They continued their message by noting how speaking together about \"the goodness of God\" across barriers is an \"important expression of the language of hope\".They said: \"This is so important as we begin the journey of recovery from the impact of coronavirus.

Yet we believe there are signs of new le all around us in the vaccination programme and the good response to public health guidance.ldquoLet us encourage one another to communicate the hope that by Godrsquos help, our common le will slowly , and together seek his grace to renew our lives.\"In closing, the bishops said: \"We pray that the Holy Spirit of Pentecost may inspire us so that we communicate in our words and deeds the hope we have in God.ldquoMay we as Christian people speak of our belief in the transforming power of God, and by his Spirit to work together for the rebuilding and re-energising of our churches and society.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Access should only be restrictedany confidential information is discussed. If any person considers that access to meetings is being restricted unnecessarily, their first step should be to approach the council with these concerns.But access remained denied, so the Minister was asked to amend legislation around this sticking point.A spokesperson replied: ldquoGiven legislation currently allows public press access to committees and subcommittees subject to the exclusions previously advised, the Department is not at this time considering making amendments.This was shared with councillors, with all who replied commenting positively around press attendance.Councillor Barry McElduff, Sinn Fein formally called for press to be permitted access to Health Group meetings and Chief Executive Alison McCullagh suggested this could be achieved by upgrading to subcommittee status.Following unanimous agreement in December, BBC Local Democracy enquired when this could be expected, and were advised it was part of an ongoing review.The matter arose last week, and what started out as a victory for democracy, quickly dwindled when members learned upgrading meant quota rules of membership would apply.Councillor Emmet McAleer, Independent suggested retaining working group status, but opening meetings to public and press, but the Chair Councillor Stephen McCann replied: ldquoThat conversation has been had a number of times and we are aware why that cannot happen. However it was given extra clout as a subcommittee, I understand the press would have access. That would address some concerns members have raised in the past.The Chief Executive stressed: ldquoThe only dference is Standing Orders apply in subcommittees, therefore press and public would have normal access.Current Health Group member Councillor Donal OrsquoCofaigh, Independent, acknowledged subcommittee status would cost him his place under the quota, but nonetheless was willing to agreeit meant public and press access.SDLP Councillor Mary Garrity said: ldquoIf itrsquos not legislatively enforceable, we come upon this quandary, whether we like it or not.However she felt working group status meant reporting back to full council and: ldquoAbsent the press, we would still get all our concerns highlighted.The Chief Executive confirmed: ldquoActions would be reported, irrespective of working group or subcommittee status.Councillor Josephine Deehan, Independent found it: ldquoRegrettable we didnrsquot have information regarding legislative requirements prior to making this decision. Irsquom concerned that members of small parties and independents would be excluded. I strongly believe in inclusion and as elected members we have a duty to represent our constituents.She added: ldquoTherersquos not a huge amount of dference between a subcommittee and a working group. In terms of involving the press and public, we would have the opportunity to raise issues at standing committees.Proposing retention of the current working group status to ensure inclusivity and current membership, Councillor Deehan said: ldquoThe only dference is access to the public and press hellipRepresentation and input from members is more important and should be the greater priority.This was seconded by Councillor Garrity.Councillor McElduff requested clarity around press access noting: ldquoObviously where possible, when we arenrsquot talking about issues which are confidential, wersquod want to err on the side of openness and transparency.The Chief Executive pointed to legislation in which: ldquoThere is no provision for press or public to attend working group meetings.Councillor Adam Gannon, SDLP noted the Health Group was: ldquoLooked at to change into a subcommittee because some members wanted it opened to the press. Whilst it would be nice to have public access to everything, it may not always happen and canrsquot always be that way.Concluding the discussion, he said whatever the status of the group: ldquoThe work is still being done. It would be nice for the public to be present, but we donrsquot need the press there to do our work. I know I donrsquot.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We’re in a large playground in Banbridge and the jollity of the children playing here seems infectious.There’s a new spirit of adventure within my boy which enables him to go on the big slides and tall climbing frames which previously he would only have gazed at longingly. Even the act of departing the park passes without complaint as I buy him an ice cream and we chat happily while walking back to the car. The amiable conversation continues as I drive from the car park.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Getting home should be no problem. I’ve driven this route many times before, straight through Banbridge and then up the A towards Hillsborough. But, perhaps today I’m just a little bit too relaxed, chatting so much that I’m not thinking about the journey. Not concentrating on where I am going.Whatever it is, I drive for about ten minutes before I realise that I am lost.To give some context, I am bad at navigating. I’ve lived close to Lisburn for many years but still am unable to drive through the town centre without getting disorientated.Once, in a hotel, I mistakenly stumbled into a walk-in wardrobe and had dficulty finding my way out.So here I am I’ve clearly taken a wrong turn and now I’m driving along a rural road somewhere in Co Down trying to find anything that I recognise or a sign that will guide me to where I need to go.Then, just as I’m beginning to lose hope, we spot a settlement. A tiny hamlet.‘Here we are buddy, here’s a little town. We’ll be able to work out where we are now.’We pass a sign. It reads ‘Welcome to Corbet’.I read it aloud. My son begins to laugh. There is something onomatopoeically comic and pleasing about the name. I’ve never heard of Corbet before.I look for a sign to tell me how to get home but can’t find one. There are no people in the street. Corbet seems to be a quiet place and we pass quickly through it.I turn off onto a smaller road and drive some more. Then I make another turn, and another. My logic is thatI drive for long enough, I’m bound to spot somewhere I recognise.Then we pull out onto a larger road, after another minute I see a settlement and a sign.It reads ‘Welcome to Corbet’.‘Bloody hell’, I whisper, but my son can’t hear me because he’s laughing again. We drive through Corbet again. Still there are no people. I wonderanyone lives here.This time I go off in another direction. The road I’m driving on now is very narrow, just one lane and no room for passing. It’s when I notice that there is grass growing in the middle of the road that I realise I may have made a terrible mistake.I speak to my son.‘I really hope we don’t run into another vehicle on this road.’No sooner have the words escaped my lips than a huge tractor pulling an even bigger trailer appears on the road in front of me, blocking out the sun. Both vehicles stop. The young farmer driving the tractor meets my eye. I begin to reverse along the narrow country lane.Which is hard. Which probably explains why I reverse one of my rear wheels straight into a ditch.I pull the car forward, the wheels spinning as they bump out of the trough. Then I reverse again. After what seems like several miles of retreating with my car engine squealing in protest, I come to a farm entrance and am able to pull my car in so the tractor can pass.I look at my son. He looks at me. His role-model.We drive on. A couple of miles later I see a man in a field. I stop the car and get out, waving him over. I askhe knows the way to Hillsborough.‘Hillsborough ’ he repeats, scratching his chin, ‘I don’t know how you can get there from here.’Despairingly, I ask himhe knows the way to Dromore. He points me in a certain direction, although without conviction.I follow his direction. I turn onto another road and see a settlement and a sign.It reads ‘Welcome to Corbet’.I’m a bit worried now. I consider the possibility that Corbet doesn’t actually exist other than as an idea in my brain. It’s a Blair Witch-type vision of horror that I’m condemned to repeat over and over again, each time my hopes are raised only to be shattered when I see the sign ‘Welcome to Corbet’. I’m cursed to keep driving through Corbet until I’ve got a long, white beard, warning off other foolish young travellers who get lost.I gather myself and try again, even though leaving Corbet is evidently harder than leaving the EU.We set off again, on another road which I’ve never seen before in my le. We drive a few miles until we come to a settlement. The only really good thing I can say about this village is that it is not Corbet.We come to a little crossroads and I finally see a road sign.The arrow to the left says ‘Dromore ’ The arrow to the right says ‘Dromore ’I sit there. I look at my son, he shrugs his shoulders.I pick one of the roads and drive for a bit until I see a sign for Dromara, which I know is close to where I live. I follow it and am eventually able to find my way back to Hillsborough.After I park in our driveway, my son gets out and falls to his knees on the tarmac, kissing the ground. Then he hugs our house. It all seems a touch melodramatic.When we go inside, he breathlessly recounts to his mother the details of our adventures, the story of getting lost in Corbet.She stares at me.‘Why didn’t you just use the satnav on your phone ’I stare at her. I have no answer.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Secondly, there will not be another border poll for at least another  years, unless nationalist parties win the popular vote outright in an election.Understandably, some unionists will be fearful about actively calling for a border poll. But such concern must be balanced against the following three factors. Firstly, Irish nationalism is pushing strongly for a referendum within this decade. If unionists are to going to have to face such a poll in the near future then they must seek to control its timing.Secondly, the NI protocol has already blatantly violated the principle of consent and is in the process of creating an all-Ireland economy. Both these factors will inevitably to lead to Irish unitynot challenged.Thirdly, a referendum will force Alliance Green Party voters to take a more definitive position on the constitutional question. Given the social-economic benefits of remaining in the UK, this would most probably favour unionism, at this point in time. The government could of course deny such a referendum. In such circumstances, unionists would not be in any worse position constitutionally by collapsing the Assembly, than that which the Irish Sea border has already imposed upon them. Those parties that supported the protocol would face the sanction of losing their assembly seats and salaries. This may force some of them to take a more balanced approach to unionist concerns. Crucially, Sinn Fein would also be denied their long term objective of being in government in both parts of the island. The new leaders of unionism need to start their reigns by asking themselves how they want be remembered in history.

Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He added: ldquoAs far as I could tell from Sage, and as far as the minutes show, the fundamental assumption remained we canrsquot do lockdown, we canrsquot do suppression, because it just means a second peak.Mr Cummings said March  was a ldquocompletely surreal day, starting with him texting the Prime Minister at .am saying: ldquoWersquove got big problems coming.ldquoThe Cabinet Office is terryingly s***, no plans, totally behind the pace, we must announce today, not next week, lsquo you feel ill with cold or flu stay at homersquo.ldquoSome around the system wanted to delay because they havenrsquot done the work.ldquoWe must force the pace, wersquore looking at  to , deaths between optimistic and pessimistic scenarios.He said the day got derailed from dealing with Covid because in the morning ldquosuddenly, the national security people came in and said lsquoTrump wants us to join a bombing campaign in the Middle East tonightrsquohellip and we need to start having meetings about that through the day with Cobra as well. vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Cummings said a story about Boris Johnsonrsquos fiancee Carrie Symonds and dog Dilyn had been printed ldquoSo everything to do with Cobra that day on Covid was completely disrupted because you had these two parallel sets of meetings, you had the national security people running in and out talking about lsquoare we going to bomb the Middle East rsquohellip And then to add to it, it sounds so surreal it couldnrsquot possibly be true, that day The Times had run a huge story about the Prime Minister and his girlfriend and their dog, and the Prime Ministerrsquos girlfriend was going completely crackers about this story and demanding that the press office deal with that.ldquoSo, we have this sort of completely insane situation in which part of the building was saying, lsquoare we going to bomb Iraq rsquo, part of the building was arguing about whether or not wersquore going to do quarantine or not do quarantine, the Prime Minister has his girlfriend going crackers about something completely trivial.ldquoAnd you have all these meetings kind of going on through the course of the th.He said he had a meeting with advisers Ben and Marc Warner around pm ldquowhen they kind of hit the total panic button with me and they said, lsquowersquore looking at all this data, wersquore looking at all of these graphs, wersquore heading for a total catastrophe and we need to have Plan Brsquo.Mr Cummings said that on the evening of March  it was realised that a meeting would need to be held with Mr Johnson to explain ldquowersquore going to have to ditch the whole official plan, wersquore heading for the biggest disaster this country has seen since .Mr Cummings has tweeted a picture from this evening, which he called the ldquofirst sketch of Plan B, PM study, Fri   eve ndash shown PM Sat  .He said the ldquosecond most powerful official in the country at the time, Helen MacNamara, who was deputy cabinet secretary, walked into the room during the meeting with Ben Warner on March  and said: ldquoIrsquove just been talking to the official Mark Sweeney who is in charge of co-ordinating with the Department of Health. He said, quote, lsquoIrsquove been told for years that there was a whole plan for this. There is no plan.

I think it is a disaster.He said that on March , the Prime Minister was told: ldquoYou are going to have to lock down.But Mr Cummings added: ldquoBut there is no lockdown plan. Sage havenrsquot modelled it, DH donrsquot have a plan, we are going to have to figure out and hack together a lockdown plan.He added: ldquoThis is like a scene from Independence Day with Jeff Goldblum saying, lsquothe aliens are here and your whole plan is broken, and you need a new planrsquohellip that is what the scene was like that morning, with Ben Warner in the Jeff Goldblum role.ldquoHe took the Prime Minister through all the graphs, and through the NHS graphs, and showed him that the system is thinking this is all weeks and weeks and awayhellip but this is all completely wronghellip The NHS is going to be smashed in weeks.Mr Cummings said it was a ldquohuge failure on his own part that he did not push harder for an earlier lockdown.He said: ldquoI bitterly regret that I didnrsquot kind of hit the emergency panic button earlier than I did.ldquoI think, in retrospect, therersquos no doubt that I was wrong not to.He said he was ldquoincredibly frightened to say the official plan was wrong in case he himself was wrong..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Run up to first lockdown was like scene from Independence Day, Cummings claims article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
