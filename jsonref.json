A flamboyant dresser, he liked to match his business suits with cowboy boots, together with the semi-permanent cigarette that dangled from the corner of his mouth.Then there was the family heirloom, an old coat that had belonged to his grandfather, with a moth-eaten fur collar.The coat came in handy during a business trip to Argentina when he wanted to smuggle four Impressionist paintings out of Buenos Aires. He rolled them up inside a poster of The Beatles and hid them in its capacious folds.During another excursion in South America, he was said to have ended up ‘serving time in a Chilean prison for a crime nobody ever quite got to the bottom of’.It all helped fuel the Pollen myth. Bespectacled and fastidious, he liked to sleep on his back with his hands folded across his chest in a priestly pose and he had a passion for ‘white food’ — soft cheese, Mother’s Pride bread, hot dogs and shellfish.         With his love for people, places and things, as well as a sense of curiosity, Pollen, whose daughter Bella (pictured with Pollen) is the fashion designer turned best-selling author, was perfectly poised to embrace the new post-War era with money to spendThe cultured Old Etonian was instinctively drawn to the beauty of the art world. An insatiable collector, his brilliant eye resulted in a vast range of collections in fields as erse as minerals, shells and natural history specimens.He was a trustee of Westonbirt, the world famous national arboretum created by his great-grand-father Robert Holford, and would travel the globe collecting, propagating and planting seeds as well as corresponding with experts.One of his most vital tasks was to establish woodlands of native trees to replace the losses from diseases such as ash dieback and Dutch elm. Records show that he planted between 6,000 and 8,000 trees to transform the parkland of Norton Hall, the family home in Gloucestershire.After the excitement of his quarter of a century at Sotheby’s when he travelled more than 100,000 miles a year, he might have found life there a little slow.Far from it — it became the centre of his universe where he would shoot pigeons, build towering bonfires and trundle around the estate at the wheel of a tractor.With his love for people, places and things, as well as a sense of curiosity, Pollen, whose daughter Bella is the fashion designer turned best-selling author, was perfectly poised to embrace the new post-War era with money to spend.Peregrine Pollen was born in Oxford in 1931, the son of Captain Sir Walter Pollen, an industrialist who was awarded the Military Cross during World War I. His sister Pandora was headmistress of Hatherop Castle school, near Cirencester, from where years later she expelled the teenage Bella.         Pictured: James Dugdale, assistant to Peregrine PollenIn an interview three years ago, Pollen recalled: ‘My sister was quite right to expel her. Bella is so independent, she rebelled — in fact she rebelled at every age. She was just so naughty, so disruptive, but I knew she’d be alright. I was more worried about my sister, who thought she’d failed me.’Of his childhood, he said: ‘We were very spoilt as a family. My grandfather was a banker and he had a wonderful collection of Italian paintings, which he sold in the 1920s. It was quite a serious collection. The money ran out in the 1950s, but we still have some nice pictures.’Another family collection, belonging to a great uncle Sir George Holford, which included four Rembrandts, had ended up in the U.S.After Eton, where his contemporaries included Antony Armstrong-Jones, who later married Princess Margaret, he did National Service with the King’s Royal Rifle Corps, and read classics at Oxford, where he won a bet by running a mile, riding a horse a mile and rowing a mile in under 14 minutes.For two years from 1955 he served as aide-de-camp to Sir Evelyn Baring, governor of Kenya at the time of the Mau Mau insurgency.By the time he arrived in the auction world, his CV included work as a petrol-pump attendant, warehouseman, oddjob man in a psychiatric hospital, ship’s caterer and organist in a Chicago nightclub.Before joining Sotheby’s he had applied for work at Christie’s where a cousin was head of Old Master paintings. ‘I got a hugely pompous letter back… so I gave up on them.’He quickly became assistant to Sotheby’s then chairman Peter Wilson, but soon got bored and attempted to launch a helicopter commuter service. It failed to take off and in 1960 Sotheby’s sent him to New York to open an office.When he learnt that the Parke-Bernet galleries, the biggest auctioneers in America, was for sale, he convinced Sotheby’s to buy. It gave the company its first overseas saleroom and within five years he had tripled their combined turnover.Beanpole-tall Pollen married Patricia Barry, who had worked for the security services, in 1958. In New York she became a teacher.They had three children, Susannah, who is an art adviser, Marcus, who runs a steelworks, and Bella, who famously dressed Princess Diana in the early years of her marriage before becoming a writer.The couple orced in 1972, but remarried six years later, by which time he had two more children, Josh and Lally with Amanda Willis. Patricia died in 2016.As executive vice-chairman of Sotheby’s, he was widely tipped for the top job, but after being passed over for chairman in 1982 he quit.In an interview before his death, Bella, recalling the moment she was expelled from school, said: ‘He was there at the station. Instead of giving me a hard time, he took me off for a huge alcoholic drink.’She added: ‘If I ever asked him what I should do, he would think for about three seconds, then say: “You should do what makes you happy.” ’It was certainly a mantra he lived by."},{"url":null,"title":"Benjamin Netanyahu declares victory Israeli election exit poll shows just shy majority","story":"Share this article          A man plays a guitar as others around him wave Likud party flags and show its election signs with the face of its leader Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Likud\u0027s electoral headquarters in the coastal city of Tel Aviv on March 2         Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses his supporters after first exit poll results for Israeli elections in Tel Aviv, Israel, Monday, March 2Anshel Pfeffer, who wrote a biography of Netanyahu, said on the website of the left-wing Haaretz newspaper that a win for the veteran politician would be a \u0027stunning comeback\u0027 for a man \u0027who doesn\u0027t lie down after a setback\u0027.Netanyahu campaigned vigorously on his strongman \u0027security-first\u0027 platform, familiar to Israeli voters over decades, and his loyal base of blue collar voters has stood firmly behind him throughout, seemingly unfazed by his imminent trial.\u0027While we need to wait for the final results, there is no doubt that Prime Minister Netanyahu has won a significant political mandate from the Israeli people,\u0027 said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute. \u0027Israelis voiced their support for the man they perceive to have brought them security and prosperity,\u0027 he said.Netanyahu\u0027s re-election bid has been complicated since the last election by his indictment on charges of bribery, breach of trust and fraud over allegations he granted state favours worth millions of dollars to Israeli media barons in return for favourable press coverage and that he wrongfully received gifts.

As a result, the Government has said that onshore wind and solar can take part in low-carbon power auctions – where energy contracts are awarded after competitive bids.Energy Secretary Alok Sharma said ending the UK’s contribution to the climate crisis ‘means making the most of every technology available, and that includes backing more onshore wind and solar projects’. This will be achieved ‘in a way that works for everyone, listening to local communities and giving them an effective voice in decisions that affect them’.The U-turn comes just days after the Government indicated it would not appeal against a court ruling blocking a third runway at Heathrow Airport.

Aged three or four, he was left in a car in a supermarket car park not for long, maybe a few minutes, but long enough to wonder if his parents might not come back. The feeling never left him: “In a child’s mind, it is possible to be alone for ever.”Somehow, in his subconscious, that feeling of potential abandonment attached itself to animals. He was disturbed by the way humans might silence or confine animals, in zoos or on farms, even at home. Years later, he wanted to find a harmless way of photographing that feeling.How to do it? First, he wandered around his neighbourhood in east London looking for cars with a bit of cinematic glamour, then he left a note on the windscreen saying: “Can I photograph your car and put a dog in it?” To get the dogs, he sidled up to their owners in parks and asked them if he could put their dog in a car at night and photograph it in the name of art. He was astonished that most said yes.His new book contains nearly 50 of these set-ups. There are dalmatians in the back of Citroëns and jack russells in ice-cream vans Prospero, pictured here, weighs up his options in the driver’s seat. Usborne had imagined the pictures would share a kind of noir-ish dread to match his infant fears. Some did, but in others the dogs relaxed or just settled down to nap. The variety of response adds to the sense of strangeness.

It’s tempting to see its publication of Ben Halls’s impressive debut, set around Quarry Lane – the Quarry – an outer London estate stranded by deindustrialisation, as an attempt to address the notion that discussions about inclusivity leave working-class men behind.The thwarted protagonists of these tender tales are often crushingly lonely, from 20-year-old shelf-stacker Jacky, grieving his boyhood abandonment by a feckless father who ran off to Marbella, to the long-serving pub bouncer in Little Ones whose thoughts of calling it a day to be closer to his wife and child take on new meaning at the story’s close.They dream of getting lucky, whether it’s with a barmaid or a fixed-odds betting terminal, but the hope kills them: any break is always too good to be true, as a Paddy Power clerk saving optimistically for a flat in central London finds when he falls in with a sharp-suited punter promising a glamorous job in exchange for inside information.About the best that can be hoped for is when envy of someone else’s apparently great life is tempered by a dawning realisation that we all have our struggles, as happens to overweight IT guy Nick, intimidated by an old schoolfriend’s bravado out on the pull in London’s West End.The best stories thrive on uneasy comedy. In Tea, narrated by a John Lewis salesman who dresses as a woman for weekly trysts with Stephen, an abusive man in denial about his own sexuality, there’s a spectacularly awkward moment when, at work, the narrator realises that the new mother whom he’s helping to choose an oven is Stephen’s wife.Halls gives his flair for knuckle-chewing agony free rein in Fix, an emotional helter-skelter of hopes repeatedly raised and dashed, in which a serial bankrupt assures his partner he’ll pick up their son from school but ends up instead having to pawn his phone (really, her phone) in an increasingly desperate bid to recoup his gambling losses.Another standout piece, Exams, follows a call centre worker at a birthday party attended by an ex-girlfriend whose movements he can’t help monitoring on social media. Halls sets a trap by cultivating sympathy for the narrator’s wounded sense of rejection, before a knockout revelation.Halls can overdo the hopelessness: in Modernisation, a retirement-age postman struggling to cope with the demands of privatisation returns to the Quarry after a long absence, only for snarling, tattooed locals to brand him a paedophile. But overall, the highs here far outweigh the lows, at least for Halls’s readers, if not his characters.• The Quarry by Ben Halls is published by Dialogue Books (£14.99).

Matthew Hancock, the health secretary, said that Britain may follow the lead of “European countries at more advanced stages of an outbreak,” adding: “All options are on the table.”The supermarket contingency plans were detailed by a City analyst, Bruno Monteyne, of investment firm Alliance Bernstein. Monteyne was previously a supply chain director at Tesco.Monteyne said a major outbreak of the virus could result in “panic buying, empty shelves and food riots.” However, he added that retailers have “ready-made plans” to deal with disruption and move to “feed-the-nation” status.“Yes, it will be chaotic (and expect pictures of empty shelves),” he wrote in a note to investors, “but the industry will reduce complexity to keep the country fed.” Monteyne’s note said Tesco, the UK’s largest supermarket chain, has practised “multiday simulation” exercises, including mocked-up news coverage, with different teams preparing responses to a flu pandemic. Tesco confirmed it carried out such preparations and said they were part of being a “responsible retailer.”Monteyne said supermarkets and their suppliers would work together to agree “a major reduction in ranges” so that suppliers can run their plants more efficiently. He added the big grocers were likely “to be drawing up lists right now of which products will be prioritised”.He said he did not expect prices to rise because “food retailers cannot be seen to be profiteering at a moment of crisis”. However, he warned the disruption could cost the sector £1.2bn in lost profits.Monteyne added that in the event of acute food shortages he expected the army to be called in “to protect depots, food trucks and stores” and that all grocers and suppliers would start working together.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.UK Chief Medical Officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland\u0026nbspChina, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and who is experiencing a cough or fever or shortness of breath to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.The coronavirus has spread to\u0026nbspat least other 30 other countries. The most badly affected include Japan, with 850 cases, including 691 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, and four deaths. Italy has recorded at least 1,100 cases and 29 deaths, while South Korea has recorded more than 4,212 cases and 22 deaths. There have also been deaths in Hong Kong, Taiwan, France, the US and the Philippines.There have been 36 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed outside China, but by no means in all 195 countries on the WHO’s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority of cases are travellers who picked up the virus in China.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has\u0026nbspdeclared the outbreak to be a public health emergency\u0026nbspof international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.Several of the big food retailers reported signs of panic buying. A senior executive at one major grocer told the  it was witnessing stockpiling of bottled water, core grocery lines such as tinned food and pasta, and cleaning products.The British online supermarket Ocado has advised customers to place orders further in advance than usual because of “exceptionally high demand”. It said: “More people than usual seem to be placing particularly large orders.” Members of the department for environment, food and rural affairs’ Food Chain Emergency Liaison Group is expected to meet this week to discuss how to limit the impact of coronavirus.The group links key food and drink firms and the National Farmers’ Union with government departments to deal with any potential disruption to food supplies, such as that which could have followed a no deal Brexit last year.Defra said in a statement that the group “can be convened in the event of an emergency response situation, linking together the food industry and central government civil contingencies activity to swiftly mitigate any issues and ensure a healthy and varied supply of food”.Consumers have also been stocking up with frozen food, according to supermarket Iceland. Managing director Nigel Broadhurst said it has had more shoppers in its stores, spending significantly more than normal. “Sales of frozen food have seen notable increases and we have noticed a trend towards customers selecting multibuy deals and larger packs.”Waitrose, Morrisons and the Co-op convenience chain refused to comment on stockpiling, and said only that they were seeing more demand for cleaning products and hand sanitisers.But a senior executive at one of the UK’s main supermarkets said: “All the big supermarkets have a plan B for sourcing.” Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, also said there had been an increase in demand for hand sanitisers and other hygiene products and that availability of products remained good.He added:“Retailers are working closely with their suppliers and monitoring consumer behaviour to anticipate changes in future demand.”Ian Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said his organisation was “in regular dialogue with the government and its agencies on how the food and drink industry should react to the spread of Covid-19.“At this stage, supply chains have experienced disruption but there is no evidence of significant disruption to food supplies. UK food and drink manufacturers have robust procedures in place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dccb86e6ffd695015f3b765e9387acf5ab59042/587_329_1720_1032/master/1720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5adb6816098736cdaeee14b604acade6","title":"a coronavirus recession could be supply side with a 1970s flavour","story":"The most recent collapses were caused by a drop in demand – the next one could mimic the oil shockIt is too soon to predict the long-run arc of the coronavirus outbreak. But it is not too soon to recognise that the next global recession could be around the corner – and that it may look a lot different from those that began in 2001 and 2008.For starters, the next recession is likely to emanate from China, and indeed may already be under way. China is a highly leveraged economy, it cannot afford a sustained pause today anymore than fast-growing 1980s Japan could. People, businesses and municipalities need funds to pay back their out-size debts. Sharply adverse demographics, narrowing scope for technological catch-up, and a huge glut of housing from recurrent stimulus programmes – not to mention an increasingly centralised decision-making process – already presage significantly slower growth for China in the next decade.Moreover, unlike the two previous global recessions this century, the new coronavirus, Covid-19, implies a supply shock as well as a demand shock. Indeed, one has to go back to the oil-supply shocks of the mid-1970s to find one as large. Yes, fear of contagion will hit demand for airlines and global tourism, and precautionary savings will rise. But when tens of millions of people can’t go to work (either because of a lockdown or out of fear), global value chains break down, borders are blocked, and world trade shrinks because countries distrust of one another’s health statistics, the supply side suffers at least as much.Affected countries will, and should, engage in massive deficit spending to shore up their health systems and prop up their economies. The point of saving for a rainy day is to spend when it rains, and preparing for pandemics, wars, climate crises, and other out-of-the-box events is precisely why open-ended deficit spending during booms is dangerous.But policymakers and altogether too many economic commentators fail to grasp how the supply component may make the next global recession unlike the last two. In contrast to recessions driven mainly by a demand shortfall, the challenge posed by a supply-side driven downturn is that it can result in sharp declines in production and widespread bottlenecks. In that case, generalised shortages – something that some countries have not seen since the gas queues of 1970s – could ultimately push inflation up, not down.Admittedly, the initial conditions for containing generalised inflation today are extraordinarily favourable. But, given that four decades of globalisation has almost certainly been the main factor underlying low inflation, a sustained retreat behind national borders, owing to a Covid-19 pandemic (or even lasting fear of pandemic), on top of rising trade frictions, is a recipe for the return of upward price pressures. In this scenario, rising inflation could prop up interest rates and challenge both monetary and fiscal policymakers.It might seem strange that the new coronavirus could cause so much economic damage even to countries that seemingly have the resources and technology to fight back. A key reason is that earlier generations were much poorer than today, so many more people had to risk going to work. Unlike today, radical economic pullbacks in response to epidemics that did not kill most people were not an option.What has happened in Wuhan, China, the current outbreak’s centre, is extreme but illustrative. The Chinese government has essentially locked down Hubei province, putting its 58 million people under martial law, with ordinary citizens unable to leave their houses except under very specific circumstances. At the same time, the government apparently has been able to deliver food and water to Hubei’s citizens for roughly six weeks now, something a poor country could not imagine doing.Elsewhere in China, a great many people in major cities such as Shanghai and Beijing have remained indoors most of the time in order to reduce their exposure. Governments in countries such as South Korea and Italy may not be taking the extreme measures that China has, but many people are staying home, implying a significant adverse impact on economic activity.The odds of a global recession have risen dramatically, much more than conventional forecasts by investors and international institutions care to acknowledge. Policymakers need to recognise that, besides interest rate cuts and fiscal stimulus, the huge shock to global supply chains also needs to be addressed. The most immediate relief could come from the US sharply scaling back its trade-war tariffs, thereby calming markets, exhibiting statesmanship with China, and putting money in the pockets of US consumers. A global recession is a time for cooperation, not isolation.• Kenneth Rogoff is professor of economics and public policy at Harvard University.

And he has alienated all his alliesMaverick, out-of-control authoritarian leaders – and here we are talking about Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s president – tend to think they know best about everything, and are fiercely intolerant of criticism. It is this hubris that has finally led Erdoğan and Turkey to the brink of disaster in Syria after nine years of bombastic threats, proxy conflict and direct military intervention.Erdoğan is now isolated on all sides, sharply at odds with other major players in the Syrian crisis. Having sent an extra 7,000 troops and armour into Idlib last month to reinforce existing military outposts, Turkey has plunged in open warfare with Bashar al-Assad’s regime. It has attacked airports and radar sites well behind the de facto “frontline”. It has declared all regime “elements” to be legitimate targets.In mid-2011, when the Arab spring uprisings were just getting going, Ahmet Davutoğlu, then Turkey’s foreign minister, met Assad in Damascus and urged him to discuss the demonstrators’ demands. Assad refused. Davutoğlu later told me the Syrian leader just wouldn’t listen. The chance was lost. As Assad’s crackdown intensified, Erdoğan threw Turkey’s weight behind the rebels, including Islamist groups.But what is happening now in north-west Syria is no longer a proxy war. It is a direct confrontation between the two heavily armed neighbouring states. And it threatens to draw Turkey deeper into military conflict with Russia, Assad’s principal ally. Erdoğan’s spokespeople and the pro-government media continue to suggest that last Thursday’s debacle, when 33 Turkish soldiers were killed in an attack on their convoy in Idlib, was the fault of the Syrian regime.It’s hard to know the facts, given Erdoğan’s suppression of independent journalism. But the truth seems to be very different. The death toll may have totalled up to 55, according to Metin Gurcan, a military analyst writing for the respected online regional platform al-Monitor. Local reports speak of up to 100 dead. It also seems likely the majority of the deaths were caused not by Syrian jets but by deliberate, follow-up Russian airstrikes.Erdoğan has declined to blame Russia, and the Kremlin has flatly denied responsibility. But the sequence of events last Thursday, which began with Turkish attacks on Russian aircraft flying over southern Idlib, suggests otherwise. The Turkish fire, involving man-portable air-defence systems (Manpads), also threatened Russia’s strategic Khmeimim base.Infuriated Russian commanders – or maybe the order came from Moscow – appear to have drawn a line after weeks of lethal sparring. The Turkish convoy was hit late in the afternoon that same day. In the hours that followed, with injured soldiers in urgent need of medical aid, Moscow rejected Ankara’s request to open Idlib’s airspace to allow an evacuation, Gurcan reported.Was Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, intent on teaching Erdoğan a harsh lesson? If so, it seems to have worked. Erdoğan is now pinning his hopes on a face-to-face meeting with the Russian leader to prevent more, costly collisions that Turkey cannot win. He will travel to Moscow on Thursday in search of a ceasefire – after Putin agreed to make time for him.Yet Putin may be in no mood to back off. He badly wants an end to the Syrian war, where Russian forces have been engaged for nearly five years at considerable financial and human cost. He wants a victory for his client, Assad, in Idlib, the last rebel-held province, and for his own expansionist regional policies. He wants to declare a landmark strategic triumph at the west’s and particularly the US’s expense.Putin’s price for letting Erdoğan off the hook may be a full or partial Turkish withdrawal from Idlib but also from other Turkish-occupied Syrian territory west of the Euphrates – and from the Kurdish-dominated north-east region that he controversially invaded last autumn. Erdoğan’s always unworkable idea of maintaining quasi-permanent “safe zones” inside Syria to which refugees in Turkey can, in theory, return looks to be dead or dying.The intrinsic weakness of Erdoğan’s house-of-straw strategy has been further exposed by the inability of the Islamist extremists he supports in Idlib to resist the recent Syrian-Russian advance and by the refusal of the US and Nato to come to his assistance in any meaningful way. Turkey appealed for support after last week’s convoy calamity. Only limited help with surveillance and intelligence-sharing was offered.Once again, Erdoğan is reaping what he sowed. He has repeatedly mocked and criticised Nato, the US and European leaders in vituperative and contemptuous terms. He bought a Russian air-defence system over strong American objections. He has jeopardised the west’s fight against Islamic State by waging war on Syria’s Kurds. And he has tried to weaponise the Syrian refugee crisis to bend the EU to his will –hence the current chaos and misery on the Greece-Turkey border. Unsurprisingly, domestic opposition is growing, spurred by the Syrian quagmire.As the Idlib crisis intensified in recent months, Erdoğan claimed his sole purpose was to uphold a 2018 partial truce and prevent another mass refugee influx into Turkey. These are reasonable aims. But his aggressive tactics and angry rhetoric, as usual, have proved self-defeating. A million displaced, hungry and terrified Idlib residents may soon have no defence at all against Assad’s pitiless advance.The humbling of Turkey is no cause for cheer in Europe and the US. What it does do is underscore its responsibility – so far shamefully ducked – to intervene directly in the Idlib crisis to protect civilians, halt the fighting, and pursue a wider peace. Leaving it to Erdoğan was never going to work. The western democracies have a last chance to do the right thing in Syria: manufacture and enforce a just and lasting settlement – and tell Putin and his bombers to go home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/586b851dc13ce18348eb60132473350b498fb0ba/0_0_5108_3065/master/5108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=494a07a40e083c1c32479ee6d1f13272","title":"the guardian view on europe and britain cherish the ties that bind","story":"In troubled times, the global challenges that face us can also unite us. This newspaper will place itself at the heart of the debate“Beyond … differences and geographical boundaries there lies a common interest”. Throughout his career at the forefront of European diplomacy, Jean Monnet championed this core conviction, which helped lay the intellectual foundations of what was to become the European Union. His words were a call to action, which resonated with and inspired people in the aftermath of the second world war. But the message of collaboration and the cultivation of shared interests also speaks urgently to our own times. This newspaper deeply regretted the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the union which Monnet helped create.

We believe this is not only desirable but imperative at a time when huge challenges, from the rise of China to the future of the digital revolution to counter-terrorism, require a pan-European response.In Europe’s south-east, a new migration emergency is developing. Tens of thousands of refugees have massed on the Greek border this week, invited to do so by Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Mr Erdoğan has said his country can no longer cope with the volume of refugees created by the Syrian conflict. But the EU, fearful of a resurgence of nativist populism, has still to come up with a working plan to accommodate asylum seekers across its member states.Crises such as these concern us all. The launch of This is Europe is a statement of intent – far from shrinking its horizons after Brexit, the  will seize this moment to reaffirm its European focus, identity and sensibility.

The cross-currents of reciprocal cultural influence over centuries have made Europeans, and Britons, who they are. The Irishman Edmund Burke’s Reflections on the Revolution in France played a part in the history of British conservatism. Friedrich Engels famously studied capitalism at close quarters in Manchester. Europe’s great literature traces our connections in poetry and prose. In Dante’s Divine Comedy, published in the early 14th century, Francesca of Rimini and her lover Paolo are portrayed as succumbing to the sin of lust, after reading about Queen Guinevere’s tragic love affair with Lancelot in the Arthurian tales. A little more recently, Elena Ferrante’s remarkable portraits of female friendship, the Neapolitan novels, also captured the imagination of readers across Europe. They charmed through being both exquisitely local, while exploring a universal theme. The European public square is where we – and you, our readers – live and belong. The debates within it are more urgent than ever. We are committed to having them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bb9a53984b964b2427d3a6cc573f41708d06860/0_185_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e7555f62f439c491c2df1d31a2f661e","title":"overhyped overvalued tech startups","story":"In November 2013, venture capitalist Aileen Lee published an article coining the term “unicorn” to describe a startup that’s less than a decade old and worth at least $1bn (about £783m now). She chose the word carefully, to convey a mix of rarity and alchemy. What Lee seemingly didn’t anticipate was that just a few years later it would have become a flagrant misnomer: these days there’s nothing rare about unicorns.According to website Crunchbase, 142 new companies met the criteria in 2019, taking the herd size to over 500. They’ve got a combined worth of more than $2tn, which is bigger than the gross domestic product of countries such as Canada and Italy, and their heft is perhaps the most striking indicator of our global economy’s return to absolute and unmitigated exuberance.It might seem odd to the majority of us, who are used to stagnating wages and an increasingly dilapidated public realm, but businesses are actually flooded with cash. Squeezed by years of rock-bottom interest rates, investors have been on a desperate hunt for assets that offer a yield above zero, throwing money at every conceivable candidate.Globally, more than half of outstanding government debt offers a negative yield – which is to say that many investors now have to pay for the privilege of lending money to states, where they at least know their assets will most likely be safe. But even corporations, which have more of a chance of defaulting, have been able to issue bonds with yields below zero, because the interest that their debt offers is marginally higher – or less negative, if you will – than the interest on other assets.So how did the rules of the economy get turned on their head like this? Interest rates were initially cut in the wake of the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers and the ensuing financial crisis, in order to kickstart economic recovery. But in the absence of any real growth to speak of, they’ve been stuck there ever since. The result is both cheap borrowing and lots of lending.Against this background – too much cash and too few places to put it – investors have been easily seduced by the bright lights and shiny things of Silicon Valley, where a growth-at-all-costs mentality trumps such antiquated and pedestrian metrics as profitability. Why invest in a plain old low-risk government bond or mundane index that offers – at most – a sliver of return, when you could take a punt on a super-innovative startup? Obviously the downside risk is substantial, but the prospect of having spotted the next Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg makes splashing major cash palatable. If you’d spent $22 on one Apple share in 1980 when the company went public, your holding would now be worth almost $18,000.And so we’ve ended up with these frequently absurd overvaluations. Uber, Lyft and the owner of Snapchat have all in the last year received investment that gives them multibillion-dollar price tags, despite all making a solid loss. Tesla, more than $13bn in debt at the end of last year, recently had a market capitalisation of $160bn, greater than General Motors and Ford combined.The money sloshing into those entrepreneurial coffers is being propelled by a desperation to survive in a low-interest world, often foundationless optimism and – quite likely – an exaggerated belief in one’s ability to spot tomorrow’s wunderkind. But red flags are starting to appear and we should take them seriously.WeWork, famous for operating buzzy beer-on-tap co-working spaces, was forced to abort a huge stock market listing last year, despite having attracted billions from Tokyo-based conglomerate investment company SoftBank. SoftBank owns considerable stakes in businesses like Uber, Alibaba and Slack and its billionaire founder, Masayoshi Son, is regularly hailed as Japan’s answer to Warren Buffett.The misfire led commentators to refer to WeWork’s CEO and co-founder, Adam Neumann, as a sort of Icarus – a visionary who flew too close to the sun and came crashing down. The company’s valuation was slashed from a preposterous $47bn to a still eyewatering but comparatively puny $8bn Neumann was ousted as CEO and was forced to give up majority voting control of the business.Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson declared in a note to clients last September that the “days of endless capital for unprofitable businesses” are over. WeWork’s failure to float, he said, was reminiscent of three historical events: United Airlines’ disastrous leveraged buyout in October 1989, which effectively ended the 1980s boom of companies being bought with debt the AOL-Time Warner tie-up in 2000, which marked the start of the dot-com bust and JP Morgan Chase’s 2008 purchase of defunct investment bank Bear Stearns. “It was one heck of a run,” wrote Wilson. “But paying extraordinary valuations for anything is a bad idea, particularly for businesses that may never generate a positive stream of cash flows.”And while markets still look fairly buoyant, it’s clear change is on the horizon. There are more WeWorks out there – houses of cards run by delusional wise guys – and we should endeavour to spot them before they catch us off-guard.Why? Because the collapse of a large company can send shockwaves through the entire economy and we don’t have much in the way of defences at the moment. Remember General Motors? By some accounts the US government bailout after the company’s 2009 bankruptcy cost taxpayers more than $10bn. And then there’s the fact that interest rates can’t stay pinned to the floor for ever. Central banks need to raise them in order to be able to cut them again when necessary. The process of doing so, however, is unlikely to be pretty. Record low rates have created distortions. Many companies have taken on a huge amount of debt because it’s been dirt cheap to do so. When rates rise it will become harder to service that debt. As Buffett famously said: “You only learn who has been swimming naked when the tide goes out.”For now this might sound abstract and irrelevant. But financial systems are a complex web of intertwined risks and dependencies. Our savings, our pensions, our mortgages and our loans are all at the mercy of what’s happening elsewhere, including in companies that seem invincible until the moment they aren’t. So beware of the unicorn, especially if it’s actually a dishevelled nag with a cone stuck to its head. It might seem thrilling for now, but it could well be an omen of unpleasant things to come.• Josie Cox is a columnist, reporter, commentator and broadcaster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7c1cfeb6b25e47732fd4dd7dc5dc730a8a8985f/152_1080_2531_1518/master/2531.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93fa82508dc6fc4117eb28fd8e634c3e","title":"tories austerity budget","story":"Now is the time to invest – not just in northern infrastructure but in public services and the fight against climate crisis. It won’t happenThe budget will at last define a government that has stayed tantalisingly opaque. Who are they really? What do they really mean to do? This budget arrives amid a battalion of crises: coronavirus, severe flood damage from climate crisis and our homemade Brexit fallout, with billions wiped off stock markets. A crafty chancellor, watching his revenues falling, should see this moment as a God-given opportunity. Never let a good crisis go to waste, as they say. If they are genuinely determined to “level up” the nation’s inequalities then they should seize the day to borrow, tax and spend like there’s no tomorrow – because otherwise there might not be much of one.Imagine the Conservatives really meant it. Look what they could do on a honeymoon bounce, with an 80-seat majority won on a splurging promise to end austerity. The opposition is in leaderless disarray, Brexit is done (for now), and the Tory press still crows in adulation: see those “Baby joy for Boris” and cuddly Dilyn the dog stories.The darkening clouds give the government authority for action – there’s no better time for boldness. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) charts how every government at the height of its powers raises taxes in its first post-election budget. Next week’s needs to make the most of that tradition, or austerity will be baked into this government almost as severely as the last.Look up, and the sky is thick with bright red kites being flown above the Treasury, testing the weather for a host of astonishingly un-Tory ways to raise tax. Target property, says one kite, pointing to vast billions of unearned, untaxed wealth in the swollen assets of older generations sitting pretty in homes bought decades ago. A mansion tax was mooted, despite the opprobrium heaped on Ed Miliband’s plan when he was Labour leader. One kite suggested replacing business rates with a land value tax: target the raw value of the land, not the house, to capture the appreciation whenever the state builds a new station or a good school nearby. Easier still, if less radical, a revaluation of council tax bands – unchanged since 1991 – so the most expensive properties pay fairly.Here’s an easy test. So-called entrepreneurs’ relief is a capital-gains fiddle gifting just 5,000 rich company owners £350,000 each and costing the Treasury £3bn. It doesn’t encourage new entrepreneurs. Every serious analyst mocks this scam. Yet, even here, the auguries are not good: 150 prominent business leaders have written to the chancellor warning him not to touch it, threatening that start-ups will go to Singapore instead. The Sunday Times objects, warning the chancellor in a leader that business “still has to be convinced that this government is on its side”. Or what? They’ll vote Labour?Javid may in fact have made tax rises harder. Despite all those red kites he flew, he now tells his fellow back-benchers that he planned a 2p income tax cut. A Treasury riposte, however, says he never mentioned it.The upshot of all this is depressing. Expect a minimalist budget, not much of anything, say Treasury briefers. In the autumn, things may be clearer, they say – with no reason why. But one very interesting kite is still, just, fluttering. The golden rule professed (though not kept) by chancellors aims to get current spending into balance with revenues, allowing borrowing only for capital investment, such as roads or rail.This is, of course, a sham: there is no clean ide between everyday spending and investment. Borrowing to build an office block yields much less return than investing in human capital. Train someone up to degree or higher apprenticeship level, and that multiplies their productivity. What’s more, long after the office block is demolished, that trained and educated person produces future generations of educated producers.The government suggests it may change the rules to borrow for human capital investment. Despite the orthodoxy, there is no fixed limit to what the state can borrow. Ex-chancellor George Osborne swore Britain would go bust if it lost its triple-A credit rating. He lost it, but nothing happened. His “Labour maxed out the credit card” line was highly persuasive to families well used to that fear, but a nonsense for governments borrowing over the long term at rock-bottom interest rates.Only strong government investment can fend off today’s gathering storms and spur the austerity-stricken economy. Levelling up needs not just northern infrastructure but massive human capital investment, as the UK has one of the least educated populations among similar countries. Boris Johnson, in Churchill mode, could call for a patriotic budget to build climate defences, repair national flood damage, and prepare for the economic shocks of Brexit and coronavirus.Rousing the national spirit, he could call on the broadest shoulders to carry the heaviest tax burden in the national interest, tapping the wealth of those barely touched by the great crash of 2008 while the rest lost out for a decade. That’s something most easily done by a Tory government. But why would it? For all the “austerity is over” promises, don’t hold your breath. Expect token hi-vis building projects, but little to fill the black hole created by the great austerity. This government is not Keynesian: the nature of the beast will still be thoroughly Tory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a803faa685951bbe66d5f618bbfd0a8f685874e0/0_276_8318_4994/master/8318.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf871ddbe34134c9fc786183e6447456","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of paradise","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘paradise’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘paradise’.Share your photos of what paradise means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 4 March at 10am.

Phil Foden had the answer on Sunday. By sprinkling his magic across Wembley to inspire Manchester City to victory in the Carabao Cup final against Aston Villa.The 19-year-old has long been considered as the heir apparent to David Silva, who will depart City in the summer after 10 years of casting his spells from midfield, but the Foden accession is no fancy of supporters desperate to see one of their own take centre stage. It is Pep Guardiola who has anointed him. “David is going to leave this season and we are not going to buy any player in his position because we have Phil,” Guardiola said in January. “If we didn’t believe in him we might go to the market to replace David, but we have Phil.”The vagaries of the transfer window are such that Guardiola cannot categorically close the door on adding creative talent in other words, situations can change. But his encouragement for Foden has provided motivation and inspiration.“If the manager says something like that, it gives you a lot of belief and courage to keep playing and doing well,” he says. “With the manager behind you, it can only help you and make you better. He is always trying to help me each day and it’s just a pleasure for me to be a part of it.”Sometimes the yearning for the local boy to make good can blind fans to harsh realities but the question for Foden, particularly after Sunday, is not whether he will make it but how quickly and where.Nominally a No 10, there was an element of surprise when Guardiola lined him up on the right of his front three. In one of the biggest games of his short career, Foden was out of position. The challenge was immense and, possibly because of his burgeoning status, it was no exaggeration to say that all eyes were on him. The noise around Foden has been a constant since he starred for England’s under-17s in the World Cup triumph of 2017. He was named player of the tournament.The way Foden seized his opportunity was breathtaking one of those coming-of-age stories so beloved of top-level sport. There was a stillness around him when he did his work, the sense that the ball was his best friend, almost an extension of his body. Witness when he was buffeted early on by a Villa challenger only to retain his balance and accelerate away. Most players would have gone down. Or when he took the most casually perfect touch to kill a high pass, jink inside and shoot just wide.There was a moment in the second half when he took another crossfield ball and, without letting it touch the ground, juggled forward with it. A bit of showboating? No. The over-riding impression was of a young player enjoying himself, eager to show everyone what he could do. It is the purity of the first touch that sets apart the very best Foden’s is a thing of beauty. And, remember, he influenced this final from an unfamiliar position. Guardiola, who prizes tactical flexibility, would have loved that.Kevin De Bruyne said last week that sometimes City’s players “don’t really know until the game starts what we need to do”. Guardiola wants them to interpret their roles, to respond to the ebb and flow. Foden, who set up the first goal of City’s 2-1 win for Sergio Agüero, did just that.It is the curse of a journalist to talk up young players but, at times like these, it feels unavoidable and with Euro 2020 looming it is surely inevitable that there will be a clamour for Gareth Southgate to call up Foden to the senior England squad.The problem for Southgate goes beyond the embarrassment of riches he has in terms of young attacking midfield talent (Mason Mount, James Maddison, Dele Alli, Jack Grealish, Ruben Loftus‑Cheek). It also concerns whether he can select a player who has yet to complete 90 minutes in the Premier League this season and has done so once in his career.For now, Foden can enjoy a man‑of-the-match performance for his club in a Wembley showpiece but the treadmill does not stop and next up is the FA Cup fifth-round tie at Sheffield Wednesday on Wednesday. The excitement around Foden is palpable. He is ready to step up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9e1643832e657e13d440f5d940bdbefc1af77bb/0_157_3027_1816/master/3027.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7443236fdd0dbc8ed67d0126ab89d71","title":"portsmouth arsenal fa cup fifth round match report","story":"Mikel Arteta is nothing if not brave. With the outcome of their season hinging on their progress in the FA Cup after being dumped out of the Europa League, the Arsenal manager saw his faith in youth rewarded by a clinical away victory thanks to goals either side of half-time from Sokratis Papstathopoulos and Eddie Nketiah.Against motivated opponents backed by a vociferous crowd, Arsenal rode the early Portsmouth storm and it took two flashes of inspiration from the returning Reiss Nelson to ease their path into the sixth round.The forward – one of six players aged 20 or under who started here - was a constant menace down the right flank and totally justified his inclusion ahead of the £72m record signing Nicolas Pépé with a brilliant performance that showed Arsenal supporters there may be reasons to be positive about the future after all.“I’m pleased with all of them – the kids responded really well,” said a delighted Arteta. “I was looking at them in the 94th minute and they were still pressing and chasing. It’s a joy. I’m really enjoying working with them. They fully deserve the chance. I know it’s risky to play them in this competition but it’s worth that risk.”With the FA Cup representing Arsenal’s last chance of silverware this season after their defeat by Olympiakos, Arteta surprisingly made nine changes, with the Spanish defender Pablo Marí handed his debut. Nelson returned from injury to make his first start of the year in a youthful attacking trio alongside Gabriel Martinelli and Eddie Nketiah. Arteta admitted his team selection had been influenced by the Europa League defeat that had left several of his senior players “still hanging on what happened”.He had been similarly bold in selecting his emerging crop of young players in the ruthless victory at Bournemouth in the last round but against a Portsmouth side who had won their last 10 home matches in all competitions, this trip to Fratton Park was always likely to be a more testing occasion.Not since the infamous defeat to Wrexham in 1992 have Arsenal been eliminated from the competition by a team from outside the top two isions but in Kenny Jackett, their rookie manager was up against someone with real pedigree in the FA Cup.The former Wales midfielder played for Watford in the 1984 final and also guided Millwall to the last four in 2013, with Portsmouth having already seen off four teams to reach this stage.Third in League One and chasing a return to the second tier for the first time in nearly eight years, there is a positivity around the club not seen since the 2008 FA Cup triumph and it was reflected in the bouncing atmosphere at the kick-off.Despite making six changes from the win over Rochdale on Friday that included leaving the captain, Tom Naylor, and the top scorer, Ronan Curtis, on the bench, it was not hard to see how Portsmouth have put together such an impressive record at this old ground given the way they started.Arsenal did well to withstand the early barrage and Lucas Torreira was withdrawn after quarter of an hour following a bad challenge from James Bolton and the midfielder left the ground on crutches with his ankle in a brace.Portsmouth continued to make the running as they were serenaded with chants of “We’re our way back” from three sides of the ground, even if they failed to really test Emiliano Martínez in the Arsenal goal.Matteo Guendouzi’s harsh booking for placing the ball on the pitch in an over-deliberate manner as he took a free-kick would have done nothing to improve Arteta’s mood as half-time approached but a brilliantly composed finish from Papstathopoulos in first-half injury time from Nelson’s pinpoint cross settled his nerves at just the right time.“We needed those moments in the first half to go for us,” Jackett said. “We disappointed not to go in at 0-0. That deflated us.”Tony Adams, who was the assistant manager to Harry Redknapp in 2008 before taking over a few months after their famous triumph at Wembley, was introduced at half-time to a rapturous reception from both sets of fans. He also lifted the FA Cup three times with Arsenal and will have been impressed with the way the side he captained with such distinction for 14 years put the tie out of reach within six minutes of the second half.Fittingly in the city synonymous with his maritime namesake, once again it was Nelson who provided the ammunition after leaving his marker, Steve Seddon, for dead to allow Nketiah to bundle home at the near post.Jackett threw on boyhood Arsenal fan Curtis and striker partner John Marquis in a last throw of the dice but Portsmouth struggled to exert the kind of pressure they enjoyed in the first half, with Bukayo Saka’s shot almost extending Arsenal’s lead as the clock ticked down.Portsmouth know their main priority is to achieve promotion, while Arteta will take heart from the way his new-look defence saw out this victory with minimal fuss after all the last-minute drama against Olympiakos."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da591d12e459aaa3900b1e071307dc87d8d1fb6a/0_51_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76548c097fbf2a5c631e6fe2f6bd71ab","title":"from sous chef to security guard how the nation uses its smart speakers","story":"While more than one in five households now own a smart speaker, not everyone is getting the most out of their device. We asked some Amazon Echo users to share their most-used commandsSmart speakers have become a fact of life in the UK in 2019, so much so that in March this year, they were added to the list of items the government uses to accurately measure the cost of living.For some, the Echo is the perfect device to keep children entertained on a regular basis. Laura Moross, a PR consultant from London, explains that her family’s Echo is placed in the kitchen, so that she can use it when playing with the children or helping her kids with their homework.“At breakfast we can shout out song requests – everything from Baby Shark to G-Love and Special Sauce,” she says.Last Christmas, she says, she used the Echo to amuse her children by asking Alexa to track Santa’s whereabouts around the world, as well as asking: “Alexa, how many sleeps until Christmas?” Meanwhile, her children are also amused to hear the Echo’s various fart noises on demand.Meanwhile, Govind Dhaliwal, 31, from Milton Keynes, uses the device while he cooks – to convert units of measurement, and also as a timer.“I can run multiple Alexa timers simultaneously – and I can identify each one by giving them names, that way I know when to check on the food,” he says.Dhaliwal also uses the BBC Good Food skill from time to time to get specific recipes read out to him. He says that the “hands-free” element helps him to focus on cooking without having to keep washing his hands to revert back to a screen to read the recipe again.“It’s especially helpful as you can ask Alexa to pause the recipe while you carry out each part of the method and then carry on from where you left off,” he says.Kate Smith, 35, from London, asks Alexa to turn on her downstairs lights when she walks into the room. This works using a smart plug, which she has connected to her lamps.“It’s quite nice to walk in and be able to turn on the lamps to provide mood lighting, as we don’t use the main lights as much,” she says.In addition, Smith asks Alexa to add items to her shopping list, which can also be viewed on the Alexa app on her phone, meaning she doesn’t have to worry about forgetting her shopping list anymore.For Paul Granger, 67, from Derbyshire, the main reason he uses the Echo is to listen to Audible in his living room.“Since retiring I have more leisure time, and I enjoy being able to sit down and listen to one of my favourite books, while taking in the view of my garden at the same time,” he says.In addition, Granger uses Alexa to remind him to take his medication and to ask for the latest news from the . To do this he asks Alexa to open the , and then asks for the latest cricket headlines and the latest news on Brexit.There are also those that rely on Alexa to control their smart homes.Kelly Morgan, 23, from Hull, has connected her smart speaker to her smart lights, doorbell, camera and lock. This means she can ask Alexa to lock her front door without the need for keys. It also gives her peace of mind when she’s on holiday.“We keep the Echo on when we’re away, as the doorbell triggers Alexa announcements, and we also have scheduled the lights to go on at certain times to give people the impression that we’re at home,” she says.As our world becomes more connected, smart speakers will only prove more useful – perhaps, one day, even vital. But even in 2019, a mere five years since Amazon Echo first hit the market and took smart speakers mainstream, the question is less “What can I use my Echo for?” and more “What can’t I use it for?”Learn more about what you can do with Alexa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5793e737a89e388eb3bbe6b37a962dbec604ab41/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=110b890c408a0c5ace4d96e9077b9d30","title":"ethiopia detains 13 canadians accused improperly practising medicine","story":"Canadian Humanitarian members deny distributing expired medication or acting without approvalAuthorities in Ethiopia have detained 13 Canadian healthcare workers and volunteers, alleging the group were improperly practising medicine in the country.Canadian Humanitarian, a non-profit organisation based in the province of Alberta, confirmed the detentions but denied allegations it had distributed expired medication or was offering medical services without prior approval.“The care they provide in Ethiopia is the same care they would provide here in Canada. We are vigorously defending the actions and decisions of our team knowing that every decision was made by highly trained and certified Canadian medical professionals and that their mission on this trip was to provide essential medical care to the citizens of Ethiopia who need it most,” Canadian Humanitarian said in a statement on its website.Global Affairs Canada has confirmed it is aware of the detentions and that consular officials have been in contact with the Ethiopian government.The group were travelling in the mountainous northern city of Gondar when they were detained on Friday. In addition to 10 volunteers, three Canadian staff members and two local employees were taken into custody.“Just like all of our trips, our team and organisation followed all necessary steps and protocols to ensure our group had all permits needed to provide medical support and care while in Ethiopia,” the charity said. It added it had enjoyed “longstanding, positive, and collaborative relationships” in the country for more than 15 years.Rob Oliphant, the parliamentary secretary to Canada’s foreign minister, told the Globe and Mail newspaper that Ethiopia had so far been “cooperative and helpful” by permitting consular access to the detainees, who have been remanded for two weeks. But he cautioned that officials in the country “can’t interfere or step in” to impede a police investigation.Oliphant has confirmed that the Canadian ambassador to Ethiopia, Antoine Chevrier, will be present on Tuesday when the Canadians can appeal against their detention.Canadian Humanitarian said it would not comment further on the issue nor would it release the names of those in custody."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f831de27524fad8419ff36706b277c2ee1606786/805_345_4434_2660/master/4434.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f942b73407eb6609ecffdc3e4a5e289f","title":"from siestas to saunas the 10 european wellbeing traditions everyone should try","story":"The health benefits of the Mediterranean diet are well known – but have you considered fangotherapy, uitwaaien and fika?Think of “wellness” and you may well think of Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop: modern, exclusive, quite possibly rubbish. But a lot of what would fall under that banner dates back centuries and has its roots in Europe, not California.“There is a unique wellness culture in Europe,” says Beth McGroarty, the director of research at the Global Wellness Institute, a US nonprofit group. It dates as far back as Roman spas and the ancient Greek focus on preventing sickness, not merely treating it. “Europe has its own ancient medical thinking and wellness traditions and we don’t seem to pay any attention to them.”The continent is also home to some of the happiest, healthiest countries in the world, although the UK doesn’t trouble the top 10. So, what can we learn from European wellness practices and traditions?The siesta, a short afternoon nap, is believed to have evolved in Spain to allow farmers time to rest during the hottest hours of the day. The tradition persists in the country, with work hours extending later to accommodate the break.A large study in 2007 found that heart diseases were less prevalent among people who regularly took a 30-minute nap, while research in 2010 discovered that an afternoon snooze could improve the brain’s ability to learn.“Even just slowing down for a short period of time allows you to disconnect from the world and subsequently boost energy, focus and creativity,” says Paul Joseph, the founder of the travel company Health and Fitness Travel.Iceland consistently ranks highly in metrics such as life expectancy and blood pressure, placing third in Bloomberg’s 2019 healthiest country index, behind Spain and Italy.The Nordic diet shares some similarities with the life-extending Mediterranean diet, although it is lower in fruit and vegetables, advocating moderate consumption of fat and protein along with canola oil (a type of rapeseed oil), wild berries and root vegetables.A diet high in fresh fish, and therefore omega-3 fatty acids, is considered key to a healthy diet in Iceland. Haddock, herring and cod – including the cheeks and tongues, the most prized parts – are all dietary staples. Fermented shark is a national dish.It is also common for Icelanders to take a daily supplement of cod-liver oil during the winter months, when it is difficult to get enough vitamin D from sunlight alone. The benefits of fish oil and omega-3 are contested, but their proponents say they relieve joint stiffness associated with arthritis and improve the condition of teeth, nails, hair and skin.Although the use of mud as a beauty treatment was documented in ancient Egypt, with clay from the banks of the Nile being applied to the face and skin to improve appearance and texture, it was popularised in Italy during Roman times – “fango” is Italian for “mud”.From there, fangotherapy spread with the Roman empire mud treatments and wraps remain a common spa treatment across Europe and further afield.While different types of mud (mixed with mineral or thermal water) are said to have different properties, fangotherapy is most effective as a gentle cleansing treatment and has relaxing, anti-stress effects. These should not be sniffed at: chronic stress affects the immune system and causes high blood pressure, fatigue, poor mental health and even heart disease.Is there anything the Mediterranean diet can’t do? It draws together common food types and healthy habits from several southern European countries, including Greece, Spain, southern France, Portugal and Italy. As such, there is no single definition, but it is typically high in fresh fruit and vegetables, wholegrain cereals, olive oil and unsaturated fats, with moderate dairy intake.Its benefits have been found to be remarkably wide-ranging: it has been associated with longer life expectancy, a healthier gut, better heart health, protection from disease, lower risk of depression, diabetes prevention and alleviation – and even improved athletic performance.Sauna culture exists across Europe, but it is deeply ingrained in Finland, where there is one facility for about every two people, the Finnish Sauna Society says. The traditional experience is to push yourself to your limit in a communal sauna with a very high temperature, then to immerse yourself in cold water or snow – and repeat.The cold experience is “crucial”, says McGroarty, with the contrast between hot and cold thought to bring health benefits. She says: “It seems to have a strong impact on cardiovascular health.”This is Europe is a new stream of  journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all. These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. Scientific studies have found that the effectiveness of this “contrast therapy” (such as for treating athletes’ injuries) is questionable, but the physiological effects are such that it persists regardless. As no one knows better than the Finns, it feels good to be really hot, then really cold. As such, icy plunge pools and snow rooms are popular as a chaser to heated or humid experiences at spas worldwide.Sophrology, a practice of “dynamic relaxation”, was developed by a Colombian neuropsychiatrist in the 60s, but it took root in France and Switzerland, where it remains wildly popular.It combines eastern and western influences, meditation, breathing techniques, gentle movement, positive psychology and visualisation to give a sense of being calm and in control.Although the practice is said to be more dynamic than mindfulness, it has similar benefits, and is said to be helpful in stress management, self-development, preparing for public speaking or even childbirth. French studies have recorded positive effects in helping cancer patients to manage their anxiety, stress and fear.In the UK, sophrology is taught at clinics in London for about £100 an hour. In France and Switzerland, it is widely covered by health insurance, used by corporate high-flyers and professional athletes (including, reportedly, the French national rugby team) and taught in schools and hospitals.It is gemütlich in German and gezelligheid in Dutch in English, you might say “smelly candles”. But it was the parallel Danish concept of hygge that launched a global lifestyle phenomenon in 2016, with concerted cosiness the suggested solution to a turbulent year of Brexit and Donald Trump.“Hygge relates to a level of cosiness and conviviality that incites a feeling of wellbeing,” says Joseph. “The core of the practice is to live in the everyday moment and appreciate everything around you – streaming the ideas of eastern mindfulness.”There is no easy English translation, but the Dutch word uitwaaien refers to spending time in wild, windy weather – usually by going for a walk or a bike ride. By replacing “bad air” with “good air”, it is believed to leave you feeling clear-headed and refreshed.“It feels exhilarating – wind is distracting, so it’s sort of meditative, in the sense you cannot think about anything else,” says McGroarty.Many northern European countries have an equivalent of the Japanese term shinrin-yoku (“forest bathing”), which refers to the restorative effects of spending time in woodland or parks.Time spent outdoors in any capacity has recorded benefits, such as increasing vitamin D levels, improving mood and focus, encouraging incidental exercise and possibly reducing pain. A 2018 study found that exposure to green space can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, premature death, pre-term birth, stress and high blood pressure. Even as little as two hours a week may have an effect.Comparable to the western coffee break, fika is another simple Scandinavian wellness philosophy that involves slowing down to prioritise social interaction. “It is a meal or a meeting allowing for social interaction and stronger relationship bonds, increasing feelings of positivity, calm and creativity,” says Joseph.The meeting can happen at any time of day – and “preferably several times a day”, advises the Swedish government. Although baked goods or sweets are often served, the key purpose is the social interaction.Building a social component into exercise, by taking a fitness class or working out with a friend, has been shown to increase motivation and accountability and even improve performance. A University of Aberdeen study in 2016 found that people exercised more when they did so with a friend, due to the emotional support.The concept of “wellness tourism”, valued by Bloomberg at $639bn, began in Europe centuries ago, says McGroarty. She points to the 200-year-old German tradition of the kur: “a commitment to taking a longer break” for the purpose of wellness.From the late 18th century until the second world war, it was common to retire to a sanatorium or a spa for a weeks- or months-long programme of rest, fresh air, bathing and steam. McGroarty likens the best-known of these destinations – Baden-Baden and Bad Ems in Germany, Bad Gastein and Bad Ischl in Austria, Bath in the UK – to “our Las Vegas of health: the places to be and to be seen”. Composers and authors would go there to work, while others would go to recover from or avoid illness.Even today, a two- or three-week-long kur can be prescribed and even paid for through the German (and Austrian) healthcare system, in recognition of the fact that healthy, rested workers are more productive.The idea of taking a longer break just to be well is at odds with the modern fashion for shorter, high-impact holidays – but “the pendulum will need to swing back”, says McGroarty. She predicts a trend for “wellness sabbaticals”, as people retreat for longer to recover from the busy world.

To eschew dos, drinks things, screenings, soirees and shindigs. It might have been the time, at a fancy dress party, that I found myself telling a complete stranger how, when I was wearing a costume like theirs, I wet myself after underestimating the time to take off the outfit. (A straitjacket, if you’re interested.)Or it might have been the time I actually wet myself.That, of course, is not to be confused with the time, at another party, that I threw up in a sink, before realising that the host had just prepared a fresh bowl of punch in said sink. As I said at the time, it was a dumb place to leave a bowl of punch even temporarily, but I was never going to win that argument – or the subsequent kerfuffle in which I argued that if either of us should leave, it should really be him.It might even have been a time when there weren’t body fluids involved but famous folk instead: Julianna Margulies in New York, Andrew Lloyd Webber in Belgravia, the Queen at Holyrood Palace. (You’re not allowed to touch the Queen, apparently.)Or it could have been one of the countless occasions at which there were merely embarrassments and humiliations (major, minor and imagined) that were endured as I thought I ought to enjoy parties and maybe I wasn’t making enough of an effort to be effervescent. Or it might have been one of the times – inevitable at my age – when I’ve walked into a party to be greeted by an ex, or worse still, an ex and their new partner. Being gregarious or egregious may feel like particularly effective defence mechanisms in the moment, but those times when I thought I was hiding my damage? It was the only thing that others could see, probably visible from space.So, after one particular fete worse than death, I stopped going to parties. No more plucking prosecco off silver salvers, spilling little bowls of risotto down myself andor soap stars, playing informal but high-stakes games of hide and seek with people who, for reasons all too easy to fathom, didn’t like me very much. Enough was enough.On the rare occasion that I actually get invited to things these days, I usually decline. Now, the nicest time I can imagine is sitting on the sofa with a friend, eating pizza and watching Star Trek: Discovery (again) or the Ustinov version of Evil Under the Sun (again). I was reflecting on all this recently at a party. A really swanky annual event, always in a lux London hotel and seriously star-studded. I’ve been several times but this year, probably for the first time, I really enjoyed myself. I did not think this was possible at a party. And yet there I was. This is no reflection on the occasion’s previous iterations – objectively, it is one of the best parties you could go to – but there was something different this year. Obviously I couldn’t just feel happy and sense enjoyment and not analyse why. What was different? What had changed? That would be me.The main difference was that I wasn’t trying to have fun. I spent the evening talking to people I like – people I love – and having interesting, engaging chats with people I barely knew. I wasn’t in pursuit of validation from strangers. I didn’t need to put others down to make myself feel better because I felt fine. Fundamentally, my motivations for going to the party were different. For me, if my motivation is wrong, whatever I end up doing is contaminated by that. Fruit from the poisonous tree, so to speak.Also, I don’t drink any more. All of this means that now, I’m something I rarely was: I was present. I still find it tricky but like everything worthwhile, it takes practice. And here is the thing that is crucial to me: I don’t think of it as a change that I made, but one that is happening.Now I look back at previous parties and I can make light of them, package them as anecdotes, so they can sound almost harmless, my trials trivial. But at the time, they were awful. Feeling like an alien in a person suit is not a nice way to be. It’s lonely, relentless and exhausting – and blimey, I was angry. I still feel like that sometimes, but not as much as I used to. I hold on to the new me, who only goes to parties for the right reason. Because, for me, change is a process and not an event. Which is just as well, seeing as events and I aren’t great mixers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eac0c15315a4c9dc7148a51180e0daf851008c80/0_0_5115_3070/master/5115.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cc0e18d607f6366e9c094b9fc784da4","title":"dive into malta adventures for the teens and paradise for you","story":"This Mediterranean archipelago offers the perfect playground for teenagers to flex their new-found confidence, writes Abigail BlasiIf you’re looking for the holy grail: somewhere that your teenage offspring will enjoy as much as you will, Malta is the place. The Mediterranean archipelago’s coastline is magnificent, with dramatic coves, dizzying sea cliffs, and Smurf-blue sea. Choose from a large collection of superb hotels, with spas, rooftop infinity pools, and beautiful locations. There are epic prehistoric sites, great museums, and extraordinary baroque architecture. Restaurants and bars look out over sea views, and there are endless shops, boutiques and markets to browse. This island country is a wonderland for the whole family, whatever their age.Malta’s e sites have been repeatedly voted second best in the world, with warm sea year-round and superb visibility. There are many shipwrecks around the islands, some dating from the second world war. This is a fabulous place to learn to e, as there are excellent facilities, with e companies offering Padi courses for ages 10 and up, and many es directly accessible from the shore.Discover Malta’s secluded swimming spots, such as the natural coastal St Peter’s Pool close to Marsaxlokk, highly rated by teens for the chance to bask at the edge and dare each other to e off the rocks. There’s fabulous snorkelling at bays all around the islands and the Blue Lagoon at Malta’s neighbouring Comino island has aquamarine water that looks as if the saturation’s been turned up a notch. The islands offer a wealth of watersports, from stand-up paddle boarding to jet skiing.Glorious boat trips are a way of life for the Maltese, and here you can choose from day trips, where you can stop off on remote beaches for lunch, to short visits to places such as the Blue Grotto, a huge natural cave whose walls glow aquamarine with reflected sea.Your family will also have a great choice of activities on land, from trotting through the surf on horseback at Golden Bay to the growing rock climbing scene. Malta’s smaller sister island of Gozo is ideal for cycling trips: hire bikes or e-bikes and you can explore along low-traffic country lanes. Teens can choose from quad biking through the countryside to Segway tours around areas such as the Maltese capital Valletta and the lofty Dingli cliffs. Another fabulous trip for teens is the Rolling Geeks excursion, with self-drive electric cars, complete with pre-programmed GPS to guide you. This allows all the benefits of an organised excursion, but with the freedom of being in your own quirky electric car. The route takes you to Malta’s film studios – the islands are regular movie and TV locations, with shoots including Game of Thrones, Assassin’s Creed and Murder on the Orient Express.There’s more to offer than outdoor activities, and a good place to start is Malta 5D and the Malta Experience, state-of-the-art films with special effects, that bring the islands’ tumultuous history to life. The Malta at War Museum is great for history buffs. It uses cutting-edge technology to illustrate the islands’ life at war, including the Great Siege when the Knights of Malta defended it against a much larger force of Ottoman Turks, and its key role in the second world war. St John’s Co-Cathedral is a spectacular sight, lined in gold and inlaid marble, and the islands’ many prehistoric sites are awe-inspiring, predating the Egyptian pyramids.One of Malta’s newest attractions is the hands-on Esplora Interactive Science Centre in Bighi, Kalkara just across the harbour from Valletta, with more than 200 hands-on exhibits to bring science alive for all ages, plus its superb planetarium.Malta’s towns are small enough to wander on foot, and teens will relish the chance to explore the shops and restaurants of Valletta and the glittering waterfront of towns such as St Julian’s and Sliema. There’s plenty of vibrant nightlife at the Paceville district in St Julian’s, as well as festivals and club nights throughout the long and balmy summer. Malta is also one of Europe’s best destinations for summer music festivals, with house, dance and traditional music, and plenty of open-air gigs. It’s even the venue for Europe’s biggest free music festival: the Isle of MTV.Whatever you like to do on holiday, from adrenaline-fizzing boat trips to vibrant evenings, be it culture, history, beachlife and watersports, or fresh seafood on sea-facing terraces, you’ll find it here. For the ideal family break as your children grow up, choose Malta, a paradise for you and even the hardest-to-please teens.With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, Malta offers more to explore"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44375a65f889654ebd5419b4b067384873d9c9ee/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70ccb5fd0ac12662535d8efad72db526","title":"fiona bruce surprised at question times level of toxicity","story":"Presenter speaks out after BBC politics show was embroiled in racism rowThe Question Time presenter, Fiona Bruce, has said she had not anticipated how angry the show’s audiences would be.Bruce, who replaced the veteran broadcaster David Dimbleby last year, described the “level of toxicity” she had witnessed on the show in the Radio Times.“I’m all for a passionate debate, and sometimes things can be heated, which is fine, up to a point. As long as we remember that we are human beings,” she said.“I feel very strongly about that. I hadn’t anticipated that I would spend so much of my time last year saying, ‘we don’t talk to each other like this.’”Last month the  journalist Owen Jones said “the BBC normalised racism” after an audience member said the number of people “flooding in” to the UK is costing public services too much.Their comments were uploaded to Twitter, a move Jones said “seemed to imply that this wasn’t racism – it was simply someone’s opinion, for us to agree or disagree with, in much the same way that we might debate the top rate of tax, or whether the railways should be renationalised”.This was not Question Time’s first audience-related controversy this year. In January the show became entangled in a racism row. The actor and guest panelist Laurence Fox said “we’re the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe”, after the university lecturer and audience member Rachel Boyle claimed Meghan Markle had been the victim of racism.Fox accused Boyle, who is mixed race, of being racist towards him for stating he had privilege as a white man. He said: “It’s so easy to throw the charge of racism and it’s really getting boring now.”The regulator Ofcom received more than 250 complaints after Fox’s appearance. Boyle later told the Observer she received a barrage of hateful comments on social media after the show.Speaking about Fox’s controversial appearance, Bruce said: “I had a briefing about Laurence, and what he might say. But the thing about Question Time is that it’s entirely unpredictable, so people will get into arguments.”In addition to hosting the show, Bruce also presents the long-running and successful Antiques Roadshow. She said there were similarities with the shows. “Antiques Roadshow is a public service. It reflects the nation back to itself, as does Question Time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fc84480602f3bad527c6af90fc65b396aa1b5c7/0_538_5031_3018/master/5031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=595d61dda5739c2ebc24c2f2fdff962b","title":"berlin clubbing cocktail d amore","story":"Nowhere beats the German capital for hedonism – which is one reason the price of real estate is rocketing. Can the club scene survive? As its home venue is closed down, we hit legendary party Cocktail d’AmoreIt is 1am on a Saturday and the crowd outside Berlin LGBTQ+ club night Cocktail d’Amore stretches from the door of its venue, Griessmuehle, along the side of the Neukölln Ship Canal and out on to the road. It takes the best part of five minutes to walk from one end of the queue to the other, and these are just the early birds: Cocktail d’Amore opened its doors an hour ago, and will go on continuously for the next 56 hours, ending at 8am on Monday.You can see why Cocktail d’Amore is such a draw. From a distance, Griessmuehle looks more like a wonderland than you might expect a converted grain mill to look: a haze of multicoloured lights glowing on the canal. Inside, Cocktail d’Amore feels like a Platonic ideal of what a club night should be. The sound system is immaculate, the music fantastic. While I’m there, at least, it leans towards the kind of sinuous mid-tempo sound that Andy Weatherall jokingly described as “drug-chug” the late DJ was so enamoured of playing the room at Cocktail d’Amore dubbed the Cosmic Hole that he wrote a track inspired by the experience, Into the Cosmic Hole.The crowd is wildly erse – dressed-down kids in hoodies alongside guys in drag girls in standard-issue techno black dancing with men in their underpants. At one point, a gay couple in their 70s sweep past. They’re conservatively dressed for dinner at the Savoy in the 1920s – one of them is walking with a silver-topped cane. The atmosphere is simultaneously friendly, excited and licentious: a friend who goes there regularly calls it “benign freedom”. Bouncers on the door make everyone cover the camera lens on their phone with a sticker you don’t realise how accustomed you’ve become to people constantly filming their night out or taking selfies and what a difference it makes to the overall mood, until you find yourself somewhere where absolutely no one’s got their phone out.The venue, meanwhile, is appealingly rough around the edges – graffiti covers the walls and the DJ booth, there’s a burnt-out car in the garden outside – and its industrial past is obvious, which adds to the experience. As Liam Cagney, an academic and regular Cocktail patron who’s about to publish a book on Berlin’s clubs, puts it: “It gives you these sort of surreal moments. You lose your sense of the outside world in these industrial spaces, like the everyday fabric has been torn off.”But you can’t miss the handmade signs on the walls with their slogans: SAVE OUR SPACES, DON’T BREAK OUR HEARTS. They look like something from a protest march, which they probably are. A few days before I arrive in Berlin there’s a big gathering in Neukölln, protesting against Griessmuehle’s imminent closure: the venue is the victim of redevelopment. Its owner, an Austrian real estate company, declined to renew the club’s lease because it wants to turn the site into offices and flats. The protest didn’t do any good: Griessmuehle is closing, and this is the last party Cocktail d’Amore will throw there.It’s a situation that has been mirrored in capital cities throughout the world, not least in the UK (look online and you can find ghost maps of London’s lost nightlife, complete with photos of shiny office buildings and apartment blocks that used to house clubs). But it seems particularly strange to talk about Berlin’s nightclubs being in crisis: they’re one of the things the city has been famed for. Techno may have been born in Detroit, but no city fell harder for its charms than the German capital. Since the early 90s, it’s been techno’s second home, host to a succession of globally known clubs, from E-Werk and Tresor to Berghain. The city’s reputation has been bolstered by the city’s longstanding reputation for what Garavelloni and Turco call “freedom and permissiveness”: “From the laws in place – there’s no set closing time for clubs – to the ways that clubs decide to auto-regulate, which is way more relaxed and loose than anywhere else, and of course the incredible out-of-the-norm people who reside here.”According to Lutz Leichsenring of Berlin’s Club Commission – an organisation and lobby group set up in the early 00s to promote the city’s nightlife – the problems began “after the financial crisis, around 2010 to 2012. We had a couple of years to breathe, but then the money was back and now we see low interest rates and insecure markets that mean a lot of companies invest in real estate. They pay speculation prices – more than the actual value of a site right now. So if you’re a club in that building they kick you out right away, because they need to earn money, they need high rents.”Leichsenring estimates one-third of the city’s clubs have been lost in the last 10 years: Germans call the process Clubsterben, meaning “club death”. New clubs have opened in their place, but as he points out: “Sometimes a very iconic club closed down and a mainstream club opened that just wants to maximise its profits, play chart music, have bottle service, because they pay a higher rent. It’s a kind of quality reduction. We’re interested in places that have a social and cultural value.”At least 40 more clubs are currently under threat, a state of affairs compounded by the fact that Berlin is a growing city in the grip of a housing crisis. Ironically, says Leichsenring, Berlin’s club scene has something to do with that. “Startups are the thing in Berlin, I think we have more of them than any city in Europe after London,” he tells me. “They’re scaling up, employing many thousands of people, and it’s very, very easy to attract talent to the city. You see the job adverts for engineers and IT specialists and they basically say, ‘Come to work in Berlin, because it’s the greatest cultural clubbing city in the world.’ That’s the main issue, not that we pay the highest wages, not that you’ll get the most amazing job.”That’s a more compelling argument to put to politicians than Berlin’s reputation as a club tourist’s destination, he says. “Tourism is perceived as over-tourism, with noise and litter.” Nevertheless, politicians seem to be listening to what the Club Commission has to say. The city authority invested €1m in soundproofing clubs to avoid neighbour complaints about noise. The mayor of Neukölln spoke at the Griessmuehle protest, and there was a subsequent parliamentary resolution that the club needed to be supported. It’s not unusual for German political parties to have “something like a club spokesman”, while a recent Club Commission event attracted senators and members of the Bundestag. There are plans afoot to reclassify clubs, giving them “the same cultural status as a theatre or concert hall”. At the moment, they’re still classed as “amusement venues, which means in building law, they’re on the same level as brothels and casinos and porn cinemas”.But the real issue isn’t convincing the politicians: it’s convincing the property developers. “You can have strong support from the politicians, but if someone owns the real estate and they legally have the right to build offices, then you don’t have a lot of power,” says Leichsenring. “It’s trying to make developers realise that they should do not what gets the maximum profit, they should maybe do something that is paying into the city. If they have a long term plan for the city, they should definitely think about including people who made Berlin as attractive as it is.”That sounds like a remarkably tall order – property developers aren’t exactly renowned for zealously guarding cities’ cultural lives – but everyone I speak to in Berlin seems cautiously optimistic about the future. Leichsenring talks about introducing a code of conduct for developers, organising conferences “so that urban promoters and club owners can pitch ideas in front of great developers”. Cagney points out that Berlin clubs have a reputation for resilience and mutability. “A lot of the people who organise parties there are quite politically engaged, a lot of them are involved in the LGBTQ+ movement, there are nights like Room 4 Resistance, which is about music and gender identities, but it’s also about being active politically. All these things bode well for Berlin’s club culture not going under.”Meanwhile, Griessmuehle has appended the words “im Exil” to its name and found a couple of temporary homes. Garavelloni and Turco are still looking for a new venue to host Cocktail d’Amore. Griessmuehle is a hard act to follow, they say. When the music finally went off at the club for the last time, the dancefloor was still packed. “People really loved Griessmuehle, they had some of the best experiences of their lives there. Knowing that this would have been the last Cocktail there created an incredible celebratory energy, ultimate joy mixed with ultimate sadness. The people on the dancefloor didn’t want to let go of the place. They didn’t want to let go of that beautiful, though sad, moment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c3082aaa8f8f9771fdb3e2a33864936b54a3de/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c5c0843800c3816ae1938c61002e14e","title":"who should lead labour podcast","story":"Ballots went out to Labour members this week as the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as leader intensifies.

A junior home office minister would have been so much better. Someone who could be bullied into taking the hit of a 45-minute punishment beating while under instructions to say nothing of any interest whatsoever.Mikey is an entirely different proposition, however. A politician mistrusted by everyone who has ever met him. Especially those who know him well. A man rejected by the Tories as their leader on two separate occasions, principally because no one could be sure he wouldn’t stab himself in the back. Give him a knife and he just can’t help himself. There will be blood. So the home secretary’s heart must have sunk when she saw that the Govester had been put up to answer Labour’s urgent question about her bullying allegations and the resignation of permanent secretary Philip Rutnam.What followed was an absolute master-class of duplicity. He began in honeyed tones. Patel was a superb minister whom he admired almost as much as he admired himself. No one does self-love quite like Gove. Then again, perhaps it’s just as well he loves himself, for no one else does. He is the bagman who inspires only fear and loathing. And just as he had lured Patel into believing she had the wholehearted confidence of both him and the prime minister, he announced – just for the hell of it – that he was opening an independent inquiry into her behaviour.Back in the Home Office, Patel held her head in her hands. She’d just been thrown under a bus. There had been no need for any of this. Boris had promised that the official line would be a full support with no comment on any of the allegations due to the impending employment tribunal. But Mikey just hadn’t been able to resist making trouble for her. Now all sorts of other allegations would inevitably tumble out of the cupboard and she was living on borrowed time. Her job was no longer nearly as safe as she had imagined. Predictably enough, another bullying claim – this one linked to a £25,000 payout – materialised a couple of hours later.Even Jeremy Corbyn seemed rather taken aback by the ease with which Gove had washed his hands of the home secretary. He contented himself with asking why the prime minister hadn’t appeared in person to answer questions on the conduct of one of his ministers and if Patel had made illegal demands of her own officials. He ended by calling for her dismissal. Gove shook his head but his eyes sparkled. There’s nothing he would like more. It was nothing personal between him and Patel. Just that he can never pass up a chance for duplicity. Treachery is his Pavlovian response.Labour MPs tried to press for a few more details. How many allegations against Patel were there? The numbers seemed to be increasing by the hour. How much had the permanent secretary been offered to keep quiet? Was Gove actually aware that bullying could be quite nuanced? That someone could be quite nice to you one day, and unpleasantly aggressive and vindictive the next?Mikey nodded with faux sincerity and humility. Westminster’s very own Uriah Heep. No one took bullying as seriously as him. No one loved Priti more than him. Now that he had undermined her, he could afford to appear more gracious. “I’ve always been happy to admit when I’m wrong,” he insisted. Cue a moment’s silence. It has never once occurred to Gove that he might be wrong about anything. Not even the odd coke binge.With the de facto deputy prime minister having effectively disowned the home secretary, it was left to Tory backbenchers – all of whom were reading off a crib sheet handed out by a lone government whip – to belatedly come to Patel’s rescue. Mark Francois and Bill Cash who had been first to complain about John Bercow’s alleged bullying behaviour were now adamant that a spot of light bullying was fair game, and that civil servants ought to man up a bit. Most bizarre, though, was new Tory Dehenna Davison, who said that her constituents didn’t give a toss about bullying just so long as the government clamped down on immigration. So as far as she was concerned, Patel could do whatever she liked.The intellectually-challenged Tim Loughton rather agreed. The prime minister had more than enough on his hands not doing anything much about the coronavirus, floods and Brexit – the ante-natal refresher courses were taking up a lot of his time – so it was entirely appropriate that he should do nothing much about bullying.Mikey smiled. He’d done enough damage already he could afford to be ingratiating. “We’ve got a good deal,” he oozed. “We’ve got Brexit done.” He was going to get a hell of a shock when he got back to his office and discovered the trade negotiations had only just started, and Boris was actively planning for a no deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c02fa2b65da16254b3674435216b68d640709bba/0_305_4602_2761/master/4602.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa040253d3beec55dbf36556c90fc281","title":"adam goodes interview racism walk away afl","story":"Adam Goodes walked away from his stellar AFL career due to the abuse he constantly suffered and is now the subject of a powerful new filmGreat sportsmen ide their lives into little boxes. A ruthless competitive drive goes into one box, a corporate smile in another, a life away from the tangled business of sport belongs to a more private compartment. The best can do this easily and Adam Goodes, the former Australian rules footballer, belonged among the elite. Goodes twice won the Brownlow medal awarded each season to the best football player in the country. He won two Premierships with the Sydney Swans and played more games in the Australian Football League than any other Indigenous footballer. In 2014 he was named Australian of the Year.Goodes is now 40 and, four years ago, persistent racial abuse forced his early retirement. He was still an imperious player but he could no longer bear the hurt whenever he was booed and taunted with the certainty that it was fuelled by racism. Last year the AFL apologised to Goodes for failing to intervene. That apology, sparked by two powerful documentaries about the way he had been hounded from the game, arrived too late.Can Goodes imagine these feelings towards football changing? “They haven’t yet done, so…”His voice trails away but Goodes is intelligent and reasonable. “It’s only been four years. Who knows? They do say time heals.”Goodes was involved in the production and promotion of The Australian Dream – a documentary made by the English director Dan Gordon, who won a Bafta for his film about Hillsborough. Gordon has also made compelling films about Victoria Pendleton, George Best and North Korea. He and the Indigenous writer Stan Grant have created a gripping and evocative documentary about Goodes and Australia’s troubled racial history.When he was a boy, football offered Goodes joy and inclusivity but between 2013 and 2015, at his peak, it became a isive battleground of racism. “It completely was,” Goodes says. “As a kid we moved around a fair bit as a family. It was difficult to make friends but sport helped. Once people saw you kick a football it broke down barriers. Instead of being the new skinny black kid you were the kid everyone wanted on their team. That really helped break those barriers as we moved from one small country town to another. The football field was a place where I could express myself and just be me. Play the game as well as you can and that’s what you’re judged on. Not the colour of your skin, or your beliefs, or the conversation you have around racism.”On 24 May 2013, Goodes and the Swans played Collingwood in the AFL’s annual Indigenous Round which is meant to celebrate ersity. As he ran towards the touchline a Collingwood supporter yelled that he was “an ape”. Goodes pointed straight at the fan. She was a 13-year-old girl who was escorted from the arena by stewards.After the game Goodes was measured. He bore no animosity and he said the girl should call him so that they could have a conversation about why he had been hurt by her insult. But the footballer did not shy away from saying she represented the face of racism. Despite being the victim, Goodes was vilified by some as a bully.“Whenever I had been racially vilified before it had been by peers or drunk men,” Goodes says. “It’s more shocking when it’s a 13-year-old child. No 13-year-old is racist. Saying she was the face of racism was me explaining that this innocent person reflected the adults around her. I don’t blame her. When she called me, I accepted her apology and spoke to her about how she made me feel. We had a really good discussion and I knew she was just copying people – because she told me they were saying this in the crowd.”The abuse of Goodes escalated. This was not the pantomime booing of the opposition’s best player. It was racist goading. In May 2015, after scoring against Carlton, Goodes did a defiant Indigenous war dance. “Being booed for two years was tough. In the first year, 2014, the Swans finished top of the table. That was my FU to the booing. I walked off with my head held high. We then got absolutely smashed by Hawthorn in the grand final. The vilification from the Hawthorn supporters was really bad.“You get to a new year and think: ‘Cool, here’s another opportunity to play a final.’ The first game in, the booing was still there. I was shocked but in the early part of that season we were winning. Then, mid‑season we played Hawthorn, that team with the disgusting fans, and lost in Sydney.“We then played West Coast Eagles and the booing was like a howl. We got thumped and I was up the whole night, thinking this could be my last year of football. I felt like an absolute piece of crap. I was an emotional wreck. I didn’t want to go to training that Monday morning. I never had that feeling in 18 years of playing. I called the coach and he brought around my best mate and I broke down. I was like: ‘I can’t do this any more.’ I needed to get away.”In August 2015 Goodes travelled to the Flinders Ranges in the South Australian outback. There, he reconnected spiritually and emotionally with his ancestors who had lived in Australia for 60,000 years before the British arrived in 1770. “Flinders Ranges, this very spiritual place, helped me ground myself. I became clear that this would be my last season. I was going to exit the game.”Goodes played seven more games for his beloved Swans. No one, apart from the Swans’ chief executive, knew of his decision. There was simply an outpouring of love as people wore his No 37 shirt and held up banners saying: “I Stand with Adam.”His final game was a semi-final defeat against North Melbourne in September 2015. Afterwards, Goodes told his teammates he could never play again. “They were sad for what happened to me,” he recalls. “They had been alongside me the whole way and seen how much it affected me. It affected them too. Everyone felt bad but I felt a sense of excitement that I didn’t have to be subjected to that shit any more.”Goodes is now doing transformative work with the Indigenous Defence and Infrastructure Consortium, which he founded, as he helps “Indigenous businesses work in the defence sector. I’ve also partnered with a company called Nogard and become the majority shareholder. No other indigenous business is doing this in Australia as we import industrial and safety goods from around the world.”His warmth and optimism is most obvious when he talks about his family – and the fun he has playing basketball in an over-35s league in Sydney with his team, the Vikings, who feature former Swans stars, including O’Loughlin. “I still love having a good blow out. We’re super-competitive as you can imagine.”Playing against teams made up of accountants and builders, Goodes says: “We’ve made the grand final a couple of seasons and we’re winning our fair share. I’m now doing pre-season with Waverley Old Boys in what you call football in England. I grew up playing soccer and it’s definitely my first love. I loved competing in the AFL but even then I followed the Premier League and Champions League.”Goodes has noticed the enduring impact of racism in European football. Knowing that England’s black players have discussed walking off the field the next time they suffer racism, he speaks clearly. “When your voice is not being listened to, what else can you do? I fully support them walking off. It would be a way of drawing the line and saying it’s unacceptable.”He flies to London this month when The Australian Dream opens in the UK but Goodes admits the film is too painful for him to watch again. The documentary allows contrary voices to express criticism – with the implication being he should have shrugged off the racism. I ask Goodes about the inclusion of Andrew Bolt, the abrasive TV host, and Eddie McGuire, Collingwood’s president. “Try and get a comment from those guys,” he suggests. “Ask how far they’ve come in these four years.”I emailed Bolt and McGuire, to ask if they had watched the film and if their views of Goodes had changed. Neither responded.However, as Goodes says: “Lots of people who watched the documentary have become more aware of our history. Last Sunday night it was screened on free-to-air television. The educational message is coming through and that really pleases me.”Captain Cook’s declaration in 1770 that Australia comprised “empty lands”, was a lie that haunts Goodes. “Our people have had their land taken from them, from the moment they were colonised. It’s the truth. We have mining companies making billions of dollars from Aboriginal land. We have Indigenous people who are 40 times more likely to experience domestic violence, 10 times more likely to die from those experiences, 14 times more likely to go to jail. We’re dying 10 years younger than non‑Indigenous people. All this tracks back to colonisation.“New Zealand gives us the perfect example. They were colonised as well but they were acknowledged. They had the treaty. They were written into the constitution which insists they teach Maori culture in schools.”Does he have hope the Australian constitution will be changed? “That movement’s been parked for now. I’m trying to make a real difference in growing wealth for Indigenous people. We’re trying to move away from welfare dependency and unfortunate disadvantage lots of our people live in today.”When Goodes accepted being named as the Australian of the Year in 2014 he highlighted the scars of his country’s racial history. He also said: “Racism stops with me.”His stance cost him the end of his sporting career but Goodes has no regret. “When I compare my mother’s journey to the journey awaiting my daughter, I can see that every generation has so much more knowledge. Knowledge is power. That is how we become stronger. Understanding how hard it has been for my mother to deal with the trial of her upbringing, and being taken from her family when she was five, we don’t judge her for not telling us when we were young. People need to understand what happened to the children of a stolen generation. That trauma never leaves them. It’s the same with the ongoing trauma of racism. Instead of masking racism, we need to deal with it day to day. It’s how we beat it.”The Australian Dream is in cinemas in the UK and on demand 27 March www.theaustraliandream.

But after their recent 3-1 win in South Africa was nearly derailed at the start by a gastro bug that moved rapidly through the squad, England will remain vigilant regardless.Root said: “After South Africa we are well aware of the importance of keeping contact to a minimum and we’ve been given some really sound and sensible advice from our medical team to help prevent spreading germs and bacteria.“We are not shaking hands with each other – using instead the well-established fist bump – and we are washing hands regularly and wiping down surfaces using the antibacterial wipes and gels we’ve been given in our immunity packs.“ There is no suggestion that the tour will be affected. But, of course, it is an evolving situation so we are in regular contact with the authorities and will proceed as advised.”It will be the first time England have played a two-match series in the new World Test Championship, the slightly convoluted scoring system of which makes each fixture worth 60 points apiece.Secure a 2-0 win and Root’s men will move within striking distance of the top two spots that are currently occupied by India and Australia and will ultimately make up the showpiece final at Lord’s in 2021.England are without Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, two of the three spinners who set up the 3-0 win in Sri Lanka 18 months ago, while Jack Leach, the third, is only just back after suffering from sepsis and flu this winter, as well as a recent calf twinge.Root, however, is confident that Leach will go into the series “full of energy”, while the expectation is that Dom Bess, Dom Sibley and Zak Crawley – three relative newcomers who shone in South Africa and have recently been in Australia with England Lions – will step up.Root added: “As well as they did, this is another test for them and they will need to use other skills and manage different things over long periods of time to score runs and take wickets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dff1e70ed4f210eb9a2b322d5fa89bfbff798976/0_0_1825_2295/master/1825.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=569f8d96986517cd0bcdcf489859736f 960w","title":"marshall monitor ii anc review classic headphones gain noise cancelling wireless battery","story":"Comfortable, durable, wireless headphones with long battery life and signature soundMarshall’s second iteration of its top Monitor wireless headphones add active noise cancellation and up to 45 hours of battery life while keeping their classic looks.Marshall brand headphones combine powerful, distinctive sound with a classic look reminiscent of the company’s guitar amps. The £280 Monitor II ANC are no exception.The headphones fully enclose your ear with medium-sized cups, comfortable pads and a firm but evenly distributed grip on your head. The headband is lined with leatherette-covered foam and does a good job of staying put without too much pressure on your skull.Despite being Marshall’s largest headphones, the Monitor II are comparatively small and discreet with a relatively low profile on your head that’s very welcome. The ear cups are held by sturdy-feeling metal arms with a full range of articulation that slide in and out of the headband, clicking into place for a comfortable fit.They fold up in a number of different ways, making them some of the most compact and easy to pack full-size headphones for travelling.Marshall’s best-in-class control joystick returns. Press it in for pauseplay, up and down for volume, or left and right for track skip. Why others don’t copy this brilliant method of controls on headphones I have no idea.Two buttons on the back hinges of the ear cups take care of noise-cancelling modes and switching the equaliser between three user-selectable pre-sets. Press the noise-cancelling button to switch between active noise cancelling (ANC) and ambient sound modes or press and hold to turn it off.The headphones have a traditional 3.5mm socket and ship with a detachable cable that can be used with or without the power on.The Bluetooth connection to an iPhone 11 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra and OnePlus 7 Pro 5G was strong and skip-free. But Marshall has taken a backward step, only supporting the most basic SBC Bluetooth audio codec.All Apple, Android and Windows devices support the improved AAC codec, while the latter pair also support aptX: a more advanced codec Marshall used in previous headphones. The better the Bluetooth audio codec, the higher the quality of audio. Thankfully, I saw no lip-sync problems with any of the common video-playing apps across Android, iOS and even YouTube in Microsoft’s Edge browser on Windows 10.Call quality was good. The recipient’s voice came through clear and loud in the headphones, while my voice was audible with a good amount of sidetone. The other end of the call said my voice was loud, clear and crisp, even if a little background noise seeped in intermittently.ANC uses inverse sound waves to cancel out unwanted noise before it hits your eardrum and has become bare minimum for high-end wireless headphones.By default, ANC is turned up to maximum on the headphones but you can turn it down in the Marshall app if you want more awareness of your surroundings. It works fine for cancelling out the rumble of an engine, and fairly well on road noise, but it is not very good at dealing with speech, meaning they are not the best for simply concentrating in an office or blocking out noisy commuters.The headphones also struggle to deal with wind noise, making listening to music in a gusty environment difficult. Turning off noise cancelling was the best option.Overall, Bose, B\u0026ampW and Sony have nothing to fear here, so if super-effective noise cancelling is your primary driver, best to look elsewhere.Marshall’s headphones have a particular sound that people love. Often they are best suited to rock, with a raw, grungy sound that’s exciting and full of energy. The Monitor II headphones also have that sound but are better at dealing with other genres of music, too, sounding almost as good with driving electronica or background lounge, while giving large orchestral scores a good go.The “Marshall sound” equaliser is active by default, which produces their best sound with an overall warm tone, fairly controlled bass and full-blooded mids, while highs are a little muted in places. The soundscape is surprisingly wide, giving a good immersive listening experience for big pieces, while there is a good amount of separation between instruments and tones keeping things clear when tracks get a bit intense.They do not quite rival the very best, such as B\u0026ampW’s PX7, but if you like Marshall’s warm, rock-focused sound, you will love the Monitor II.Battery life is so long you may forget you ever have to charge them. The Monitor II headphones are designed to last up to 30 hours with noise cancelling active and 45 hours with it off, which seemed a little conservative in my testing.That is easily enough to cover any flight or most weekly commutes without needing to charge. They take two hours to fully charge via USB-C but a 15-minute top-up will add about five hours playback if you do happen to forget to charge them.You cannot use the USB-C port for audio but you can charge them and listen to them at the same time.The headphones are not made from any recycled material but are made from responsibly sourced materials.The Marshall Monitor II ANC are a set of rocking headphones that look every bit the part.Despite being full-sized headphones, they are fairly slimline, with classic styling that sets them apart. They are robust, fold up to be much more compact than rivals and are far more comfortable than many – if you want to rock out for hours on end, they have the fit to make sure you can last as long as their 30 to 45-hour battery will.They have a sound that is slightly more refined than previous Marshall headphones, making them sound good for a wider range of genres, but the warm sound is still best with a trashing guitar packing plenty of punch and raw energy.They are not perfect, though. The active noise cancellation works for general drone but struggles with voices. They only support the standard SBC Bluetooth audio standard, not higher quality codecs practically every device is capable of using such as AAC or aptX, which is a backward step for the brand.They are certainly not cheap, and you can get a similar Marshall experience from the brand’s excellent Major III series of headphones for about half the price, but the Monitor II ANC are a warm, inviting listen that’s hard to put down.Pros: look great, fold down really compact, comfortable for very long listening sessions, long battery life, brilliant controls, great sound, decent noise cancelling, headphone socket, stable Bluetooth connectionCons: only SBC, expensive, noise cancelling struggles with wind and voices This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Running odd jobs here and there, making barely enough to get by, she was soon drawn to the cylindrical chimneys of brick kilns that punctuate the city’s horizon.Today, Geeta, 45, is a mason at the same brick kiln she wandered through as a child. She works from 9am to 5pm every day, earning 4,000 taka (roughly £36) a month. “At first the work was tiresome but now I’m used to it,” she says. Though her family continue to live in poverty, she is glad she is able to contribute towards their expenses and enjoys some aspects of the job. “Around here, the water washes everything away – so it feels good to be able to build things that last,” she says.“Sometimes the air here is difficult to breathe,” says Reshma, a single mother of two, as she weighs firewood outside her stall. After her husband left her, the monsoon destroyed her house, causing the thatched roof to collapse while she and her children slept. “It’s been one disaster after another,” she says.Now the sole provider for her children, Reshma also had to deal with the stigma of being a single parent. But focusing on pulling her family out of poverty meant she didn’t have time to think about what others thought, she says. Reshma soon began selling vegetables on the side of a road, but struggled to earn enough to feed her children. Silvery wisps of hair escape beneath the bright orange shawl she wears casually over her head. “My situation has aged me,” she says. “I used to be beautiful, but all this stress has taken its toll.”But after receiving livelihood training and financial support from the Red Cross, Reshma was able to start her own firewood business. Now she has her own secure shop space and has ersified to sell vegetables as well as firewood, ensuring a year-round income.“I wanted to find something I could sell continuously, not just by season. Selling vegetables only is a problem – if you have too much stock, it will rot if you can’t sell it. But firewood is something I can store and sell whenever people need it.” Since many families in her community use firewood for warmth, cooking and boiling water, her product is in continuous demand.Running her own business allows Reshma to juggle her workload with family commitments. “Before, I used to struggle to feed my sons and often couldn’t get home on time to breastfeed my youngest. Now I can set my own hours and be around to provide their meals. Because my income has doubled, I am able to buy proper food for my children.” Reshma also plans to use her income to repair her home, so she can better cope when the storms and monsoons come around.“People always ask me how long will you survive on your own? They think that without a man, a woman can’t survive,” says Reshma. “But I’m showing them there are other alternatives. That it’s perfectly possible to make it on your own.”And that’s what Amirjaan, at the age of 65, is doing. She yells as loudly as her lungs can muster banging a metal pan with a spoon as she walks along the winding, dusty roads of her small village in Palashpur, near Barishal. She’s calling out for all things old, broken and unwanted. Behind her she pulls a creaky, wooden cart filled with clutter biscuit tins, metal boxes, copper cups, a broken mirror.“People don’t realise the true worth of things,” she says with a grin and twinkle in her eye. But Amirjaan does – she runs a successful scrap metal business. Sitting on a straw mat, as pots and pans dangle above her head, Amirjaan sifts through the day’s findings, determining the value of each item.For a small, older woman, Amirjaan knows how to make a lot of noise and, despite her age, she regularly lifts materials in excess of 20kg. “How could I do all this if I wasn’t strong?” she smiles.Amirjaan begged for scrap metal and rummaged in the streets for whatever she could find. “I have suffered a lot.” But after receiving a cash grant from the Red Cross, Amirjaan was able to set up her own business.Not only does her work help clear the rubbish-strewn streets of Palashpur, but Amirjaan is also making a profit from recycling – and occasionally even discovers cast-away trinkets she prefers to keep. Proudly showing off a blue ring that adorns her middle finger: “Some things are too precious to me to let go of,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f92c8edbc5fc65f01141430543183b19218680cd/0_1411_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5925fd83c3dbf2e22e8d1aca0d9ef44","title":"miriam margolyes like men dont feel groin excitement","story":"The irrepressible actor loves to give people ‘a jolt’. She talks about her weight, the joy of being a lesbian – and why she sits on people on the tubeIs she, Miriam Margolyes would like to know, how I expected her to be? She is. “Everybody says that,” she replies, a little sadly. But isn’t it good to go through the world being utterly yourself? She smiles. “I know, but it would be so nice to surprise people.” Even if you know what to expect – anyone who has seen one of her regular appearances on The Graham Norton Show knows how gloriously naughty she is – Margolyes, up close, is still quite something. I point out to her that we have been talking for only 10 minutes and already she has answered the phone (to a child, she later finds out) with a terrifying, booming: “Who are you?”. Meanwhile, I’ve spotted the remnants of a chewed onion on a plate, which she ate, like an apple, for lunch (“You mean you don’t?”). She looks pleased.There is something bracing and delightfully scandalous about Margolyes. It’s not an eccentricity that has grown with age – she has always been like this, it seems. According to the actor Tony Robinson, in one of her first acting jobs she turned up late to rehearsals, apologised and said she had been “wanking off” a park-keeper. Why does she like behaving so badly? “It is true that in shocking people, there is a kind of delight in people’s: ‘Did she say that?’ I think giving people a bit of a jolt is good.”I meet Margolyes in her flat in south London, which looks out on to her lovely garden. She is 78 and shrinking, she says – she has lost an inch and is now 4ft 10in – but there is nothing diminished about her. Her career is marching along nicely – her forthright Mother Mildred in Call the Midwife has brought her to primetime TV, and her role as Professor Sprout in the Harry Potter films made her famous with a new generation, even though she has said she doesn’t like children very much.Her force-of-nature personality – her empathy, warmth and hilarious openness – has been perfect for her new direction presenting documentaries. Her latest, Miriam’s Big Fat Adventure, for BBC Two, will be a two-parter looking at the obesity crisis and the body-positive movement and exploring her own relationship with her weight.“I’ve been fat all my life and I wanted to work out why,” she says. “Could I change? And how do other people cope with it?” Being overweight “has affected and infected every part of my life. It made me less attractive, sexually. It made me miserable often as an adolescent.” It also made her develop her sense of humour, “because you can’t go around miserable all the time, so you have to make people laugh. I think it made me quite aggressive on occasion because I won’t be bullied.”Margolyes started putting weight on when she was about eight or nine. “By the time I had my periods, when I was 11, I had a 36in bust, which was the focus of much attention from the American soldiers around the place.” I must look alarmed because she adds: “I didn’t mind, I thought it was wonderful.” The alarm on my face increases. “I was quite adept at saying, oh you know, “silly” or … because I wasn’t interested in it. It didn’t inflame me, but it certainly inflamed them.” The phone rings and she barks down the line to the young boy who has called – his family is staying in her Kent holiday cottage – checking he has her autograph, telling him an actress whom he almost certainly hasn’t heard of (“I don’t like her”) comes from his town, before finishing with: “Look, I have to tell you, I’m in the middle of an interview with a very important newspaper called the . Because I’ve got a television series which is coming out. So make damn sure you watch it.”At the end of the documentary, Margolyes looks emotional when she talks about how she would like to feel about her body. But what seems surprising – because it’s unusual to hear women talk like this – is that she also says she loves her face. “I think that when people look at me, they smile, and they don’t smile mockingly, they smile affectionately,” she says now. “And I love that.” It doesn’t bother her that she has never been a conventional beauty, even in an industry where that is prized. “I don’t want to be a conventional anything!” she says. It sometimes bothered her as a teenager. “I used to feel sad that nobody used to ask me out I felt very crushed by that, actually, but it didn’t last. And when I went to university, I realised that I had a spark of something that was more valuable than beauty. I had energy, and energy is always attractive.”Margolyes always knew that she was “a performer, and I love an audience”. She grew up in Oxford, the cherished only child of Joseph, a Scottish GP, and Ruth, who developed property (she rented student houses to Ken Loach and Tariq Ali). She describes their tight-knit Jewish family as “a fortress, just the three of us. It was passionate, close, adoring.”She loved doing public speaking competitions, which she always won (“That was how I first realised that I could entertain, and that was very pleasing”) and at Cambridge she joined the Footlights theatre group, where peers included John Cleese, Eric Idle and Tim Brooke-Taylor.After university, she sold encyclopedias and worked for a market research company for a couple of years while trying to make it as an actor. “I didn’t get auditions very easily because I hadn’t been to drama school,” she says it was getting cast for a BBC radio drama “that really set me going”. She has had a hugely varied career. She was in Barbra Streisand’s Yentl and Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet, appeared in Blackadder in the 80s, won a Bafta for her role in Martin Scorsese’s Age of Innocence and has many acclaimed theatre roles under her belt, including her one-woman show Dickens’ Women.A few months later, Margolyes’s mother had a devastating stroke Margolyes has always believed that her coming out in some way caused it, and she spent the next few years helping to look after her mother. “It was a terrible time,” she says. “I was relieved when she died. I was in hysterical grief, but I am glad that it happened because I couldn’t have taken much more – when you see somebody you love unable to speak or think or move, you’re torn in bits. It’s a terrible thing.”We talk about the television presenter Philip Schofield, who has just come out at the age of 57 (Margolyes has appeared on This Morning several times, most recently in January when Schofield and his co-presenter Holly Willoughby had to apologise for Margolyes’s use of the word “twat”). “Poor darling boy,” she says. “There are millions, unfortunately,” who feel compelled to lead a secret life. “We live in a bubble of people who don’t care what sexuality people are. But there are a great many other people in the world out there who do care and make life miserable for people because of it. And I think it’s awful.”Was her sexuality ever something she struggled to accept? “I was thrilled!” she shouts. “Ecstatic. I think it gives you an identity because you can say” – she puts on a grand voice – “‘I am a lesbian.’ It put everything into place. And it was fun. I still think it’s an absolutely terrific thing to be, which is good, because it’s not going to change.”But she must have been very hurt by the way her parents reacted. “It was terrible,” she says. “And I was very, very unhappy. I knew I couldn’t change what I was I was just unhappy that I told them. But I told them because my relationship with my mother was completely open – we had no secrets from each other.” Was she not angry with them for not accepting her? “No. They came from a world which could not adapt and that’s sad. It’s their tragedy, but it didn’t become my tragedy. I’m lucky that I’m not …” She takes a rare pause. “I’m remarkably un-bitter, really.”Margolyes has been with her partner, an Australian academic, for nearly 52 years. What is their secret? “I think love and trust, and telling the truth. Never let the sun set on a quarrel. We don’t live together, which is probably why we’ve stayed together that long. She likes to work and I do, too. Communication – you must talk to your partner.” Her partner lives in the Netherlands and they see each other only about eight times a year. “I speak to her every day on the phone, sometimes more than once.” They are currently talking about whether to live together. Would their relationship work in close proximity? “We don’t know we’d have to find out. I think so, because we really do love each other. I love her more and more.” She smiles. “I don’t know that she loves me more and more.”Do they still fancy each other after all this time? Margolyes smiles mischievously. “I don’t get wet when I look at her, if that’s what you mean,” she says. “I don’t feel physical lust, but I feel mental lust. I love talking to her, and I suppose my happiest moments, really, are just lying in bed with her and looking at the ceiling and talking. That’s my big joy.” Anyway, I say, to stay with somebody (and, I think to myself, somebody who regularly eats whole raw onions) for so long is a big achievement. “Yes, I think it is,” says Margolyes. “But I am a remarkable person.”Margolyes has always been political – and is more so now than ever, I say. “In this climate? I should think so. I’d rather not have to be, but what a collection of nasty people there are in charge of us. What a disgrace. I’m disgusted by that government.” She is, she says, alarmed by the rise of rightwing nationalism, and by the anger and hatred she sees on social media. “I know that we could have a pogrom easily in this country. It could be against Jews, it could be against Poles, it could be against Gypsies. There are people who are boiling with hate and resentment and entitlement in this country and it is alarming.”She has been vocally critical about the Israeli government over the years she says it has lost her many friends. “It’s because I say things about Israel that I consider true. If I think something is wrong, I will say it, whoever is doing it.”She was a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn. How did she feel about the allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party? “I think that there is some antisemitism, but it is nowhere near as much as people say. And I think there’s plenty of antisemitism in England. People don’t like Jews. I’ve accepted that.” Antisemitism, she believes, is “widespread in the Tory party, but that’s never mentioned. Corbyn handled it badly and I regret it, because he’s a good man and he’s not an antisemite. But he should have gone, he should be out the way and let’s get on with new people.”Her wrath is reserved for the Tories. “I love British culture, I love the theatre, I love literature and the arts, the countryside, and I just feel that all the beauties of the place are being corrupted by this evil government.” She is horrified by the attacks on the BBC. “It’s outrageous. It’s vindictive,” she says, her voice rising. She cannot stand Boris Johnson. “He’s like Trump. He’s a ruthless narcissist, dangerous, drunk with power. The fact that my European citizenship has been taken away from me by that crowd of charlatans and rascals is absolutely appalling. It’s the central most miserable thing in my life at the moment.” She could always move to Australia (“wonderful country”), where she has a house and citizenship, but has ruled out living there permanently. “I will try as long as I can to have two lives. Life’s like a cream bun, you know – you want to have as much as you can.”How does she feel about getting older? “Irritated,” she says, although she concedes that people listen to her more. “They don’t see you – you’re invisible when you’re in the street – but if they’re sitting talking to you, they think you’re going to be talking sense because you’re old. And it may not be true.” She says she demands respect. “When I get into a tube train and I want to sit down and there’s no seats, I say: ‘Please, may I sit down?’ And if nobody will get up, I sit on them.” How many people has she sat on? “I think actually just one. They were surprised, and then really quite angry.” She looks delighted.Miriam’s Big Fat Adventure starts on BBC Two on 9 March at 9pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5611ceb8ab140140133ff784eb8a88c1bdcaa203/0_269_5143_3087/master/5143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1d548a80c2f29f640bf004a17dac9f5","title":"amy klobuchar drops out 2020 democratic race","story":"Amy Klobuchar, the senator from Minnesota who campaigned as a pragmatic and moderate midwesterner, has dropped out of the race to become the Democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 US election.Kobluchar endorsed her rival Joe Biden at a rally in Dallas on Monday night, ahead of the crucial Super Tuesday primary elections. “I cannot think of a better way to end my campaign than joining his,” she told the crowd.Klobuchar was the latest in a string of dropouts. The former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg decided to end his campaign Sunday evening, and also endorsed Biden on Monday. The billionaire Tom Steyer dropped out over the weekend after a disappointing showing in the South Carolina Democratic primary.Klobuchar had argued that she was the best fit to face Donald Trump in the general election because of her experience and history of statewide wins in Minnesota, including in the more conservative parts of the state.Despite a high profile endorsement from the New York Times, however, Klobuchar failed to break through into the very top tier of the primary field. She qualified for more debates than most of her competitors and outraised other Democratic candidates who have won competitive races.But Klobuchar, 59, never polled beyond the high single digits or low double digits, and failed to rally the support of broad swaths of the electorate to remain in the race beyond the earliest primary contests.On policy, Klobuchar refrained from leaning to the left in an effort to win over early state activists. She did not support Medicare for All, arguably the most popular policy position of hardcore progressives such as Bernie Sanders, who is currently considered the frontrunner in the race. Instead, she focussed on pledges to improve mental health care, infrastructure projects, antitrust enforcement and lowering drug costs.That decision was characteristic of her approach to the 2020 race: run as a candidate who could appeal to the Democratic party at large rather than just one wing, and also make sure not to alienate Republicans or general election voters.She also hoped to break out of the field with a strong showing in Iowa, arguing that being a native of the midwest made her especially competitive. But it was not her night.Klobuchar was dogged by persistent allegations that she was cruel to her staff. Even when the New York Times endorsed her, the paper’s editorial board noted that those reports were problematic.“Reports of how Senator Klobuchar treats her staff give us pause. They raise serious questions about her ability to attract and hire talented people,” the Times endorsement said.“Surrounding the president with a team of seasoned, reasoned leaders is critical to the success of an administration, not doing so is often the downfall of presidencies. Ms Klobuchar has acknowledged she’s a tough boss and pledged to do better.”On multiple occasions, Klobuchar contrasted her record as an experienced lawmaker with that of Buttigieg.Klobuchar at times took aim at the 38-year-old mayor for being young and comparatively inexperienced.“I have been very clear that I respect the mayor’s experience very much in the military,” Klobuchar said during a debate in Iowa. “I just have different experience.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70c386437b060bc5f78c6253144ce5453fb10df9/0_0_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0a1d46a99a8d29146727df1b08ec2b4","title":"bernie sanders latino voters","story":"‘Tio Bernie’ has a commanding lead among Latinos in the key states of California and Texas.

When he left, her ballot was sealed, along with her support for Sanders.“That’s about as good as it could possibly go,” said Alonzo Ugalde, a 35-year-old engineer.“Brown people love Bernie Sanders,” said Chuck Rocha, the colorful architect of Sanders’ campaign strategy to mobilize Latino voters. “We realized that too late in 2016. So we started building where we left off.”Outreach began almost immediately after Sanders launched his campaign. In speeches, he has complemented his focus on economic inequality with calls for racial justice. And, seeking to deepen the candidate’s connection with nonwhite voters, his campaign has highlighted aspects of Sanders’ personal story as the son of a Polish immigrant who came to America without any money or knowledge of the English language.Rocha, who wears a cowboy hat and speaks with a Texas drawl, said the campaign learned from 2016 that it needed not only invest heavily but to invest early in Latino communities. That begins with hiring. Rocha boasts that the campaign has no “Latino department”. Instead, Latinos fill prominent, decision-making roles at every level. Under the banner of “Unidos con Bernie,” the campaign has demonstrated its “cultural competency” with Latinos, Rocha said. As part of its outreach effort, the campaign has hosted “Tamales for Tío Bernie,” screened the Disney film Coco and sponsored a soccer tournament.Super Tuesday will be the most consequential test yet of Latino support for Sanders. California and Texas are the biggest delegate prizes of the primary election and both have large Latino electorates.Surveys show Sanders with a commanding lead among Latinos in both states, but Joe Biden’s victory in South Carolina has revived his campaign and will boost his standing with voters of color across the country.Biden, who will hold a primary night event in Los Angeles, has polled well with older Latinos, though they make up a smaller share of the electorate. Meanwhile, Bloomberg, who has poured hundreds of millions of dollars of his own fortune into the Super Tuesday states, has also been targeting Latinos with Spanish-language ads and mailers.Strong performances with Latinos in California, Texas and Colorado could prove decisive on Tuesday and propel Sanders into the next series of contests, which includes Arizona and Florida.In California, the campaign has 105 staff members and 23 field offices statewide, which Rafael Návar, Sanders’ California state director and a native of East LA, said are mostly in “heavily Latino” and “working class” neighborhoods.Sanders visited the state for the opening of a field office in Coachella, located in the same unit where the labor leader and civil rights activist Cesar Chavez organized on behalf of the United Farm Workers of America in the 1960s.“You had not had somebody running for president visit the city of Coachella since John F Kennedy,” Návar said.The endorsement of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 30-year-old Latina congresswoman from New York, solidified Sanders’ standing among young Latinos in particular. At a rally together in Queens, she adorned him with the nickname Tío Bernie, an endearment that has resonated with Latinos who have come to see Sanders as their champion.“The story of our community is one of constant struggle in America, a struggle to be recognized, and to have full citizenship and full rights,” said Návar, a former labor organizer with the Communications Workers of America. “And so I think there’s a real connection because he’s seen as someone who has always been fighting against overwhelming odds.”Many young Latino supporters say they are drawn to his promise of Medicare for All and free college tuition. But another major part of his appeal is his ambitious immigration platform. Sanders has also taken some of the most liberal stances on immigration of any Democrat, policies that Latino staff, including some undocumented members of the campaign, helped to shape.“Latinos are going to the polls with the economy and healthcare in their minds and immigration in their hearts,” Clarissa Martinez de Castro, deputy vice-president of UnidosUS, the largest Latino civil rights and advocacy group in the country.Sanders has vowed to reverse all of Trump’s executive actions on immigration on “day one”, including ending his “zero-tolerance” policies and restoring the Daca program for young undocumented people Trump’s administration cancelled. He has also promised to place a moratorium on deportations until further review, end raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and pass comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for some of the nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US.Even Sanders critics agree his outreach has been impressive. Luis Alvarado, a Los Angeles-based Republican consultant who specializes in Latino voter outreach, praised Rocha’s approach but remains skeptical that Sanders can replicate his early state success.“Nevada Latinos are mostly blue-collar, worker-class with a family tie to a union,” he said. “Because of that, the messaging of being a Democrat socialist resonates. I don’t see that same formula applying to Latinos in a state like California and Texas.”Compared with Nevada, Alvarado said there is a broader range of economic and educational attainment among California’s Latino electorate. And Texas Latinos are traditionally more conservative than Latinos in California and Nevada. In 2018, four in 10 Hiics voted for Texas’s Republican governor, even as Latino turnout in the state drove the “blue wave” that helped Democrats regain the House majority.The Sanders campaign is also courting Latinos in North Carolina and Virginia, where a rally in Richmond last week drew more than a hundred activists from the local chapter of Casa in Action, an immigrant rights group that endorsed him.“We are leaving no stone unturned,” Rocha said.Yet Sanders’ recent praise for certain aspects of the Cuban revolution has alarmed Latinos in Florida, one of the most critical presidential battlegrounds. Democrats and the party quickly condemned the comments but say they fear the impact his nomination would have on the state’s down-ballot candidates.“Revolución and camarada are not words that should be used in Florida,” said Evelyn Perez-Verdia, a Florida-based Latino issues strategist who is Colombian American.She said his praise of socialist governments in Latin America risks alienating not only Cuban Americans, many of whom are Republicans, but also Venezuelans, Colombians and Nicaraguans. Among Latinos in Florida, Sanders polls notably behind Biden and Bloomberg.The campaign does not view Sanders’ remarks as problematic, ascribing the backlash to members of “the Democratic establishment and Republicans who never liked Bernie anyway”, Rocha said. The campaign has announced ad buys in Florida and has already deployed staff to the state, where they are targeting younger progressives who have no memory of the cold war.“The people we are talking to on the ground there love him,” Rocha said.Two days before Super Tuesday, the most consequential voting day of the presidential primary, more than 15,000 people poured into a convention hall for a Sanders rally in downtown Los Angeles. Outside sellers hawked “Tío Bernie” T-shirts as street vendors pushed carts that sizzled with bacon-wrapped hotdogs.Speaking at the rally, Marisa Franco, co-founder of Mijente, a Latinx activist organization, said the complexion of the crowd on Sunday night showed that Sanders’s support among Latinos was “undeniable”.And why is a 78-year-old senator from one of the whitest states in the country resonating with Latinos, whose median age is 29?“Real easy,” she said. “Because he’s working for it. Because his platform speaks to our people and because of the concept of palabras” – the consistency of his message.The senator stepped on stage, and, admiring the size of the crowd, boasted that the establishment was getting “very nervous”.But there was nothing to fear, he assured them. His political philosophy was simple: “My family cares for your family. Your family cares for my family. We grow together.”Among those in the crowd was Alonzo Ugalde, the volunteer who spent the afternoon canvassing for Sanders in East LA. By the time polls close on Tuesday, he estimates he will have knocked on 2,500 doors since he began volunteering with the campaign in April 2019.“I wondered if I ever would have been willing to go and knock on somebody’s door and ask them for their vote if it wasn’t for Bernie Sanders. I probably wouldn’t have,” he said. “If I run for office one day, that will be because of Bernie Sanders.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96daf9859feef53fc4dc6219438cd39aee5c1b55/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e7fd95bd8fdeab6c1b9832e6f19fd69","title":"joe biden rally amy klobuchar beto orourke","story":"Fellow moderates join Buttigieg in endorsing ex-vice-president before Super Tuesday in bid to unify against SandersWith just hours to go before Super Tuesday, the moderate wing of the Democratic party attempted to unite as a group of former candidates flocked to Texas and endorsed Joe Biden over his main rival, the progressive frontrunner Bernie Sanders.At a raucous campaign rally in Dallas, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke offered their backing to the former vice-president. Hours earlier, outside a fast food restaurant in the same city, Pete Buttigieg also offered his endorsement.Super Tuesday, which sees 14 states and two other constituencies weigh in on the Democratic primary, marks a crucial juncture in the race for the presidential nomination. There are more than 1,300 delegates up for grabs, over a third of the entire tally in the election, with the race now widely viewed as a battle between Biden and Sanders, with the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and the billionaire Mike Bloomberg lagging behind.Sanders holds a strong lead over Biden and Warren in the delegate-heavy state of California, but the race in Texas, which offers the second-largest delegate haul, is much closer, along with other battles in North Carolina and Virginia, where polls suggest Biden has a slight lead and Bloomberg remains competitive.Klobuchar and Buttigieg’s last-minute exits from the race present further unknowns going into the vote, and their endorsements of Biden, a fellow centrist Democrat, provide a major boost to his campaign.Klobuchar, having ended her presidential run hours earlier, appeared on stage with Biden in front of a packed crowd. “I couldn’t think of a better way to end my campaign than joining his,” she said, her voice cracking, as she paid tribute to her campaign staff. She urged the Democratic party to unite around him.“We need to unite our party and our country and to do it not just with our words, but with our actions,” she said.Buttigieg had flown to Texas from South Bend on Monday evening and told an impromptu event in Dallas: “When I ran for president, we made it clear that the whole idea was about rallying the country together to beat Donald Trump.” Flanked by Biden, who embraced him as he finished talking, Buttigieg added: “And it is in the name of that very same goal that I am delighted to endorse and support Joe Biden for president.”As Biden received the high profile endorsements, Sanders addressed a huge rally in St Paul, Minnesota, and paid tribute to his former competitors, inviting their supporters to join his campaign.“For all of Amy and Pete’s millions of supporters: the door is open, come on in,” he said, paying tribute to Buttigieg’s “historic… and brave campaign” and noting the former mayor was the first openly gay party candidate for the presidency. He described Klobuchar as “one of the hardest workers I know”.Warren also held a huge rally on Monday night in Los Angeles, a reflection of her strong support in California, while Bloomberg held a town hall event in Virginia that was interrupted by protesters. Tuesday marks the first time Bloomberg will appear on the ballot after he invested $500m of his personal fortune in his campaign.But in a battle for optics ahead of the critical vote, Biden’s campaign appear to win. Flanked by Klobuchar, he took to the stage as thousands of supporters chanted his name.“Just a few days ago the press and the pundits declared this campaign dead, but South Carolina had something to say about it,” he said, referencing his landslide victory on Saturday that breathed new life into a flailing campaign. “And tomorrow Texas and Minnesota and the rest of the Super Tuesday states – they’re going to have a lot to say about it.”As he wrapped a stump speech, he introduced O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman whose short run for president ended last November after poor polling and a disastrous launch announcement on the cover of Vanity Fair.O’Rourke remains popular among Democrats in his home state, however, who cheered as he entered the stage.“I will be casting my ballot for Joe Biden,” he told the crowd. “Let me tell you why: we need somebody who can beat Donald Trump.”Biden later suggested O’Rourke could have a future role in his campaign or administration working on gun control, an issue he pushed hard during his campaign.Determined not to be upstaged, Donald Trump held a campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, a Super Tuesday state where polls show a tight contest between Sanders, Biden and Bloomberg.“We like to troll,” the president told a packed sports arena. “We like to go the night before one of their primaries and we do a little trolling. It’s called, ‘We do a little trolling.’ Bernie Sanders was very upset: ‘Why would he be there? Why?’ Because I want to win. That’s a good reason.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/933e9ebe4a19e481643d67fc54d4600e50b2fa4e/0_2106_2275_1365/master/2275.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86276eaa304c3a3722ba2abc99d516ef","title":"any coronavirus lockdown would initially be voluntary","story":"Experts say scenario is likely to be self-policed amid doubts that full lockdowns are possibleAt first, a “lockdown” of UK cities to combat coronavirus would be voluntary, with residents simply asked to stay at home and avoid public spaces.In a worst-case scenario, the police could be asked to enforce road and building closures, the army could be drafted in – and those who breached rules could face specialist tribunals.Experts in emergency planning note that the UK is a long way from such a scenario. But they say that if it does become necessary, locking down whole cities or areas would be very difficult and cause huge hardship.The government has a wide range of emergency powers ranging from banning large gatherings to asking the military to help control people’s movements.Resilience planners across the country are working out how to cope if a city, town or community has to be locked down. “We’re not at that point yet,” said Jacqui Semple, the chair of the Emergency Planning Society, which speaks for resilience professionals in the UK.Semple said other measures such as stopping mass gatherings were likely to come before more drastic measures such as full lockdowns.She added: “There’s nothing off the table because this is about how we keep people safe but a full lockdown would be incredibly difficult.”“But we don’t take anything off the table at this stage because you have to make sure you have all the tools available if that is what is necessary.”Under part two of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004, the government has powers to bring in emergency restrictions on people’s movements.David Stewart, a former police officer who now heads crisis management company Taynuilt Associates, said he anticipated that at an early stage any “lockdowns” would involve health services asking people to avoid crowded places.“It would initially be self-policed with the option of the actual police providing assurance and potentially enforcing closure of roads, buildings etc.” But he said it was possible that the military would have to become involved – as they do to help out with flooding.It has been reported that in China health check apps are being used to facilitate people’s movements. Stewart said the authorities here did not have the technology to put such a system in place – and it was unlikely that British people would agree to be subject to it.He said transparency was key. “The communication needs to be completely clear and well-considered by government. The longer any kind of movement restriction goes, the more challenging it may become.”Clive Walker, who was a chief adviser to the parliamentary committee that scrutinised the Civil Contingencies Act, said there were extensive plans in place for health emergencies.He said people had generally condoned restrictions imposed during crises such as the foot and mouth disease or terrorist threats. But he said if anyone breached emergency regulations, they could face the courts – or specialist tribunals.On the possibility of the military being involved, he said: “The military might be needed to provide extra personnel at barriers or with building temporary structures.”Simon Bennett, the director of the civil safety and security unit at Leicester University, said he doubted lockdowns would be enforced and called on the government to be clearer about its thinking.“I’m not sure lockdowns are even possible. Can you see everyone cooperating? Can you see the churches all closing, mosques closing, synagogues closing? I think the way it may work is that the government asks bodies like the FA and RFU to postpone events rather than locking down whole cities.”Prof Tony Travers, a visiting professor in the LSE’s department of government, said there were no modern parallels to a whole city or town being put into lockdown.He said: “There’s no way of testing public response in advance. People react well to short-term dislocation such as train or bus network shutdowns or power cuts. There’s a communal spirit and people muddle through.“But I don’t see how you could shut down a whole city for a long time. It’s a logistical impossibility. It would put massive pressure on the national and local government.”Travers pointed out that local services were already under huge pressure and organisations such as the police and army smaller. “There is less resilience,” he said. “As the state becomes smaller, the question is whether it is still capable of mass response.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7504b65a5fde3c9dc292c75ff64199818a1644de/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2314e0ea032f99be86d6b54253a1780f","title":"britain is leaving europe the guardian is not","story":"The editor-in-chief explains why the  is deepening its commitment to European voices, issues and peopleToday we are making a renewed and deeper commitment to reporting on every aspect of Europe – the continent, its people, its politics, institutions, economy and culture. is a European news organisation with a close relationship with our large and committed audience in Europe.

These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. The publication of the research comes five weeks after Britain became the first country to voluntarily withdraw from the EU, and it coincides with a  editorial commitment to deepen its coverage of Europe.After more or less flatlining for more than a decade, support for Euroscepticism - which began to emerge as a fringe electoral theme for European far-right parties after the 1992 Maastricht treaty – started climbing rapidly from 2005.Rooduijn attributes this rise mostly to the sharp Eurosceptic turn taken by Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) party, which sees itself as a “Christian bulwark”. He notes a similar big increase in 2010 when Hungary’s Fidesz – “the future of Europe”, according to its leader, Viktor Orbán – fully embraced Euroscepticism.A third jump in support, this time among “other Eurosceptics”, came in 2013, reflecting the emergence of the Five Star Movement (M5S) in Italy. Far-right and far-left Euroscepticism made further gains in 2015 with the growing popularity of Alternative für Deutschland in Germany and Podemos in Spain.Rooduijn suggested these four distinct waves of increasing Eurosceptic electoral success may additionally be related to the EU’s eastward expansion in 2004 and the 2005 French and Dutch referendums on the proposed EU constitution the Eurozone crisis of 2010 and the migration crisis of 2015 and the 2016 Brexit referendum.“This new data shows that the rise of these parties’ electoral successes is steeper than previously thought,” Rooduijn said. “It’s striking because it means that today more than one in every three Europeans votes for a party that is critical of the EU.”The success of Eurosceptic parties, however, “is only partly due to their actual Euroscepticism”, Rooduijn said. “For almost all of them, the issue of European unification is only of secondary – or even tertiary – importance. Their electoral successes are primarily due to their positions on other issues.”He cited the example of Eurosceptic far-right parties, which make up about half of all the parties the project classifies as Eurosceptic. “These parties focus first and foremost on the issue of immigration,” Rooduijn said. “So although the EU plays an important role for them and their voters too, it is not their core issue.”Multiple studies have shown that public opinion of the EU has, on average, become more positive in the last four years, apparently reflecting mounting uncertainties caused by the upheaval of Britain’s Brexit vote and the election in the US of Donald Trump, who has made no secret of his hostility towards the EU.At the same time, alarmed by the popular backlash against Brexit, European populist leaders such as France’s Marine Le Pen, Italy’s Matteo Salvini and the Netherlands’ Geert Wilders are no longer demanding Frexit , Italexit or Nexit.Instead, said Cas Mudde, a populism specialist at the University of Georgia in the US, while most of Europe’s populist radical right parties remain Eurosceptic, they now seek to “reform the EU into a looser, more democratic organisation that returns national sovereignty to member states – although they differ on the nature of the future Europe they want.”Yet despite the broad increase in public support for the EU in general, and the softer stance of many previously hardline Eurosceptic parties, the latest PopuList project data indicates that “when it comes to actual voting behaviour and parliamentary representation, Euroscepticism is still alive and kicking”, Rooduijn said.One reason is simply the increased salience of the EU as an issue, he said. “As a result of an accumulation of various EU-related events, such as Brexit and the eurozone and migration crises, focus on the EU has increased over the years. Moreover, it’s likely to remain high on the political agenda.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b970a07a87b810eef1486788c8d5a15e1a3018c4/0_208_4441_2664/master/4441.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d1d6db33c8f4dd8eb9e3a691994b53c","title":"washington slashes chinese journalist quota","story":"State department says decision based on leveling numbers between the countries rather than retaliating over contentThe United States has slashed by nearly half the number of Chinese nationals allowed to work for their state-run media in the United States, vowing reciprocity as Beijing restricts foreign press.The move comes two weeks after China expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters, although the United States said its decision was based on leveling numbers between the countries rather than retaliating over content.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that China has “imposed increasingly harsh surveillance, harassment and intimidation against American and other foreign journalists operating in China”.“We urge the Chinese government to immediately uphold its international commitments to respect freedom of expression, including for members of the press,” Pompeo said in a statement.A state department official said that five media outlets, which last month were reclassified by the United States as foreign missions, would be allowed to employ a maximum 100 Chinese nationals as of 13 March, down from around 160 now.The United States is not explicitly expelling the 60 staff members, who in theory can seek employment elsewhere, although most are expected to be obliged to leave the country.China on 19 February threw out three reporters from the Wall Street Journal – two US nationals and an Australian – over what it deemed a racist headline on an opinion piece in its harshest move against international media in years.Chinese citizens who work for other media outlets in the United States are not affected, the official said, and state-run media outlets will not be barred from hiring employees of other nationalities.“The US government has long welcomed foreign journalists, including PRC journalists, to work freely and without threat of reprisal,” Pompeo said. “Our goal is reciprocity. As we have done in other areas of the US-China relationship, we seek to establish a long-overdue level playing field.”Last year the United States issued 425 journalist visas to Chinese citizens, including family members, according to official data.The organization most affected by the order will be the state news agency Xinhua, which will be allowed to keep 59 Chinese staff in the United States, according to a state department officialThe China Global Television Network will be permitted 30 nationals.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.The coronavirus has spread to at least other 30 other countries. The most badly affected include Japan, with 850 cases, including 691 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, and four deaths. Italy has recorded at least 1,100 cases and 29 deaths, while South Korea has recorded more than 4,212 cases and 22 deaths. There have also been deaths in Hong Kong, Taiwan, France, the US and the Philippines.There have been 40 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern.

Ten months later, the capital was devastated by a series of suicide bombings and shootings that left 131 dead, and Parisians shocked, grief-stricken and fearful.Her six years at City Hall have also seen two serious floods, several heatwaves – temperatures in Paris rose to a record 42.6 C last summer – 16 months of weekly Gilets Jaunes protests and, since December, demonstrations against the government’s pension reforms.“It’s not been a very easy time. We’ve had some terrible shocks and catastrophes, lots of events that could not have been foreseen: terrorism a massive influx of refugees and migrants and an acceleration of the climate emergency,” she says.“It’s not enough to want to be mayor of Paris because it’s fun or because you are running this magnificent city, you have to have broad and solid shoulders. It’s been like piloting a catamaran in an almost permanent force 7-9 wind for six years.”In her place, she says, some might have said “enough” but Madame la Maire as she is now called – previously the noun maire was always masculine, never mind the gender of the incumbent – is seeking a second term in office.“You have to ask, why do I want to be here, when I could be doing something a little easier? You have to work on your relationship with power … then you have to be methodical and rational, criticise, analyse before acting, understand, ask questions around you and of yourself, and once you have decided on a path, follow it. Otherwise, you are just a headless chicken,” she says.She is a technocrat who abhors populism and putting a celebrity spin on political life. She smiles a lot and is collegiate – her deputy mayors are loyal and she defers to them – but the smiles mask a steely determination.The core of Hidalgo’s first term in office has been tackling pollution and making Paris greener. Key is the idea of the 15-minute city, where residents can find most of what they need – shops, leisure facilities, education – on or near their doorstep. Her programme also includes planting thousands more trees to create mini urban forests, new parks, gardens and vegetable patches on roofs.“We have 10 years to act on the climate emergency. To act, not sit around for 10 years thinking and discussing how to act,” she says.One of her most controversial acts of the last six years has been to pedestrianise the main highway along the right bank of the Seine, turning it into a long narrow park for walkers, cyclists, musicians and cafes.Parisian taxi drivers and private car owners are among the fiercest critics of her crusade to discourage inidual vehicle use and tackle pollution by pedestrianising other swathes of the city centre, which has resembled a vast construction site at times.The motoring lobby says the subsequent build up of traffic has made air quality worse, but Hidalgo is unrepentant arguing her measures will eventually pay off. Under her guidance, the city council has already voted to ban diesel cars from 2024 and petrol cars from 2030.This is Europe is a new stream of  journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all. These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. “We’ve given vehicle owners plenty of notice so they cannot complain they were not warned,” she says. “The place for the car in our city will be reduced even more with more alternative mobility available like bicycles, more buses and car sharing.”Hidalgo is a figure who inspires valedictions and vilification. Residents of the more chic arrondissements, generally south and west of the River Seine, dislike her calls for “solidarity”, an ideology in which not all social housing, migrants, homeless and drug addicts are pushed out to grittier districts to the north and east. She is an avowed enemy of Airbnb regarding it as a form of property speculation that robs the city’s rental market of much needed homes and wants to reduce the maximum number of rental nights to 30 a year.Keeping the middle and working classes living in the city is a challenge, but she says her 2016 pledge to increase social housing, introduce rent controls and encourage publicprivate investment in development is paying off.Cleaning the city is a delicate question, especially as Paris gears up to host the 2024 Olympics. “It’s true Paris is not clean enough,” she says. “We are currently paying €550m a year to keep the city clean, we have added rubbish bins, we have increased the number of cleaners and adapted their working hours to meet the need. And still it’s not enough. This means we have another, deeper problem, a collective subject, a question of education.”Spanish-born Hidalgo grew up on a housing estate near Lyon and became French in her teens. Her maternal grandfather, Antonio, fled General Franco’s fascist Spain in 1937, crossing the Pyrenees with his family on a donkey. He returned two years later and was jailed, his family in San Fernando near Cádiz outcast as “children of the reds”.“I rise early. I go to bed late. I have few weekends and even fewer holidays but I’m not complaining. This is a choice I have made, a choice accepted by my husband and family and not a simple one for them,” she says. “It’s particularly difficult for my children who obviously didn’t choose to have a mother who is famous and recognised and who is sometimes the object of attacks, like anyone in the public eye.”The mayoral job is often seen as a springboard to the Elysée Palace, but Hidalgo insists – as she has done every time she has been asked over the last six years – she has no intention of standing for president.“My job is to transform this extraordinary, magnificent city without damaging it. To make it a city agreeable to live in but one that is a model that that inspires, without denying its history,” she says.“It comes down to values. In a worrying, anxious-making, changing world, values are the only compass. When I’m not sure what to do, when I have low points, I refer back to my values, I ask myself: why do I want to do this or that, what is in the general interest? When you are mayor of Paris you have to think about more than yourself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakConfirmed cases in the country approach 5,000 after 600 new infections were recorded on Tuesday.

The semi-official Fars news agency said Iran was “accelerating measures” in the fight against the virus, stepping up the production of face masks and sterilising materials. France, Germany and the UK were among countries that pledged to send emergency medical supplies to Iran.The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned that the world is in “uncharted territory” and has “never seen a respiratory pathogen that is capable of community transmission, but which can be contained with the right measures”. He said containment must be the top priority for all countries and that there is “no one-size-fits-all approach”. At a briefing in Geneva on Monday, Tedros said the outbreaks in Iran, South Korea, Italy, and Japan were the most worrying.Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has announced a charter flight operation to bring home 533 Hong Kong residents from Wuhan.Twitter has said: “Beginning today we are strongly encouraging all employees globally to work from home if they’re able.”Europe’s worst-hit country recorded a jump in deaths to 52 from 18 as the number of confirmed cases reached 1,835.Washington state has found itself at the centre of the US coronavirus outbreak with health officials confirming 18 cases, including six deaths, many of them linked to a nursing home in the Seattle area.British supermarkets have drawn up “feed the nation” contingency plans that would help cope with any panic-buying brought on by a sudden escalation of the coronavirus outbreak.

But, with 150 cases now confirmed in Germany, a smiling Merkel immediately held up her hands and said: “That was the right thing to do.”Coronavirus is changing social interaction, especially in the western world. Handshakes, cheek-kisses, hugs – the everyday greetings ingrained in our culture – are not as welcome as they used to be.In Italy, Angelo Borrelli, the country’s special commissioner for coronavirus, has suggested that Italians’ demonstrative nature could be contributing to the virus’s spread, urging citizens to be “a bit less expansive”.Likewise in France, where the health minister, Olivier Véran, has advised people to cut back on hugs and kisses, though the French president, Emmanual Macron, was seen to double-cheek kiss the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, twice during a summit in Naples on Thursday.In the UK, Public Health England has not gone quite as far. When Prof Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director for PHE, arrived at Radio 4’s Today studios on Monday, presenter Mishal Husain asked if it was OK to shake hands, assuming he would say it was not.In the meantime, good hand hygiene is the key message.“Science says shaking hands is disgusting,” Nicky Milner, director of medical education at Anglia Ruskin university told the . She pointed to research showing on average we carry 3,200 bacteria from 150 different species on our hands. On average, we will shake hands 15,000 times in our life time, she said.A handshake transfers twice the amount of bacteria compared to the quicker fist-pump or high-five. “If you’re shaking hands, you tend to put your palms together and wrap your fingers around. Whereas, when you minimise the contact between the skin, you have a small surface area in which there are micro-organisms, so transfer fewer. It’s all probability,” she said.The Japanese bow, the Thai “way, where palms are pressed together in prayer-like fashion, are all healthier”, she added. “In Ethiopia, they touch your elbow, then you bang opposite shoulders.”Yet, she cannot see such greetings becoming commonplace here in the UK. “The challenge would be the cultural shift.”“In the UK, the handshake is formal. It’s professional. It’s used in meeting and greeting. It closes business. It’s such a powerful procedure that we perform. It’s not just about saying hello. So that brings us back to good hand hygiene.”The World Health Organization’s director of pandemic disease, Sylvie Brand, meanwhile, has endorsed the elbow bump, footshakes, waves and the “wai” as safer alternatives to shaking hands.Dr Adam Kucharski, associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, researches how social behaviour and immunity shapes disease transmission. On reducing handshakes and kisses, he said: “Obviously all these things can reduce transmission, but there’s no one quick fix”.“If this becomes an outbreak, it’s not going to be a matter of people making one small change to their behaviour. It’s going to be series of changes across a number of aspects to their behaviour.” Awareness of and modifying interaction with vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, was crucial, he said.As more people begin changing their behaviour, church communities are among those taking precautions. Congregants with coughs and flu symptoms are advised to refrain from the “sign of peace”handshake, and to receive the communion host in their hands, rather than on their tongues.Many Catholic priests are already choosing to deliver the host this way for all parishioners, the church said. The sign of peace would be suspended in the event of confirmed coronavirus case in any congregation. Meanwhile the Church of England advice to those with cold and flu symptoms is to refrain from taking wine from the common cup.Social etiquette consultant Jo Bryant, believes the UK may have a slight advantage over its European nations, “because we are a non-tactile nation, and we do like our personal space”.“This is new territory for etiquette,” she said, advising people to “hang back a little”, before they go in for the big handshake.Her advice: Take time, hang back, look at how the other person is approaching the interaction as well, “and between the two of you, work it out”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42a3455704a73f0c0e0801ae062a3d3215ffe5da/0_101_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4179a360e5ee07050384ee2ffc24e6c6","title":"indonesias most active volcano spews massive ash cloud 6000m into the air","story":"Eruption of Mount Merapi coated nearby communities with grey dust and forced an airport closureIndonesia’s most active volcano Mount Merapi erupted on Tuesday, shooting a massive ash cloud some 6,000m (20,000ft) in the air which coated nearby communities with grey dust and forced an airport closure.Ash mixed with sand rained down on towns as far as 10km (six miles) from the belching crater near Indonesia’s cultural capital Yogyakarta.“There was a thundering noise for at least five minutes and I could see the ash clouds from my house,” said Jarmaji, a resident of Boyolali regency.Authorities did not raise the volcano’s alert status, but they temporarily shuttered the international airport in Solo city – also known as Surakarta – some 40km away after the early morning eruption.Indonesia’s volcano agency warned residents to stay out of a 3km no-go zone around Mount Merapi, citing possible danger from flowing lava and pyroclastic flows – a fast-moving mixture of hot gas and volcanic material.Mount Merapi’s last major eruption in 2010 killed more than 300 people and forced the evacuation of 280,000 residents.That was Merapi’s most powerful eruption since 1930, which killed around 1,300 people, while another explosion in 1994 claimed about 60 lives.The south-east Asian nation – an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands and islets – has nearly 130 active volcanoes.It sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire”, a vast zone of geological instability where the collision of tectonic plates causes frequent quakes and major volcanic activity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/646345a6ae038eab5ae9a8b880e099f11b29f99d/0_113_3137_1882/master/3137.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73477e11683d28501f77a84fa0c0a19a","title":"israel election benjamin netanyahu claims early victory but remains short of majority","story":"Unofficial exit polls suggest Israeli prime minister set for comeback despite upcoming criminal corruption trialBenjamin Netanyahu has claimed a premature victory following a shocking comeback in Israel’s third attempt within a year to elect a leader, even as early counts and exit polls showed he was still short of securing a historic fifth term.By Tuesday morning, less than half of the results had been recorded but unofficial exit polls gave the prime minister’s Likud party 37 seats, and a total of 59 for his rightwing alliance.He was just two seats shy of a 61-seat parliamentary majority and would only be able to form a government in the coming weeks by enticing rival politicians to join him.Regardless, the result was a stunning turnaround for a man two weeks away from the start of a major criminal corruption trial. He is expected to appear in a Jerusalem court on 17 March on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three major cases.His opponents, retired general Benny Gantz and his Blue and White party, took 33 seats, exit polls showed.In the early hours of Tuesday morning at a rowdy election party in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu told cheering crowds waving blue flags that his “victory” was sweeter than the first time he became prime minister in 1996 because it was harder.“We stood in front of strong forces. They told us we are going to lose, that it was the end of the Netanyahu era,” he said. “We turned lemons into lemonade.”Responding to the results, Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian envoy to the UK, said Israeli voters had “rewarded hate, corruption and the promise to annex the occupied territories”, referring to Netanyahu’s recent promises to take more Palestinian land.Gantz had focused his campaign on Netanyahu’s alleged corruption and anti-democratic moves. The strategy appears to have failed three times.At the Blue and White election party, the room soon emptied as rumours started to spread of a potentially disastrous result. “We are not beating around the bush and not telling ourselves stories: I share the sense of pain and of disappointment,” Gantz said.Authorities had even set up separate polling stations made of plastic sheeting for the more than 5,500 Israelis who were under precautionary home isolation after returning from areas of the world affected by coronavirus.Israel has been in an extended state of political crisis for almost 12 months after two previous general elections failed to produce a clear winner. To break the deadlock, Netanyahu had sought to energise his hardline nationalist base with promises of land grabs from Palestinians.A week ago, he announced he would go ahead with a highly controversial plan to build settlements east of Jerusalem. The plan would almost completely encircle Palestinian neighbourhoods in the holy city.Netanyahu made similar appeals before the previous votes. In April, he said he would annex all current settlements, and in September he promised to go further, by claiming sovereignty over a third of the entire West Bank.He has also looked to his rightwing global ally, Donald Trump, to help him convince Israelis that he is the only leader able to garner concessions from world powers.In late January, the US president appeared to gift Netanyahu just that, revealing a “vision for peace” plan in the White House that read like a checklist of demands from the Israeli far right. The Palestinian leadership rejected the plan as flagrantly biased.For Netanyahu, days or weeks of deal-making are now expected. If he fails, a fourth election could be called.One on the main losers of the three elections have been Israel’s left-leaning Zionist parties, including the once dominant Labour, who have largely lost support.Fearing it might not garner enough votes to even pass the threshold to make it into the Knesset, Labour merged with the centrist Gesher party. It also made a deal with the the anti-occupation Meretz party, which was itself accused of watering down its message by allying with less progressive politicians. The three-party alliance appeared to win just seven seats on Monday.At a Jerusalem polling booth, Shoshi Feld, who works for a children’s theatre, said she would vote for the alliance, but felt despondent.“It’s the least worse option,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4184409.1582639368!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"girls and autism why are so many going undiagnosed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLily Stevens (14) from Ballyvolane, Cork, is 14 loves Harry Potter. Photograph: Michael Mac SweeneyProvisionFourteen-year-old Lily Stevens may be from Cork – but she belongs to Gryffindor House. Like many other teenagers, Lily loves Harry Potter. She has read all the books, seen all the films and, of course, has the T-shirt. When she was younger, she loved One Direction, but now it’s Queen that take centre stage. And Lily also has autism – though you might not know it to meet her.In fact, unlike her brother Seán who also has autism and was diagnosed aged four, Lily was 12 before she was eventually assessed and diagnosed.“Her teachers brought it to our attention,” says Jon Stevens, Lily’s father. They raised concerns around Lily’s social skills and her closeness to just one friend. Jon and his wife Karen were shocked when the teacher suggested having Lily assessed.“She was so different to Seán that, when she was diagnosed with autism, it was just so hard,” says Jon. “His is in your face while she keeps hers inside.”A lot of things began to make sense after her diagnosis, he says. When Lily first started school, she would cry a lot and hide in the classroom toilet.“When I think about it, she was obviously overstimulated, but we thought it was just common for kids to cry when they start school,” he says. The crying gradually stopped. “She found a friend, that’s what got her through.”DelayFor people with Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) early diagnosis and intervention is key, but the delay in Lily’s diagnosis is not unusual for girls.Research suggests that four times as many boys than girls have autism, with that ratio dropping to twice as many when an intellectual disability is taken into account, but some now also believe that not all girls with autism are being diagnosed.“I do believe they are being under-diagnosed and that is doing them a huge disservice,” says Davida Hartman, director and senior psychologist at The Children’s Clinic.While every inidual with autism is different, the presentation of autism can differ in males and females.“Younger autistic boys in my experience can often be more active, more deregulated and find it difficult to sit in class,” says Hartman. “Whereas the girls in general are more compliant, and so are not disrupting the class.”She says many girls and women mask their autism in order to fit in. “They are essentially living in a world, and school system, that has been designed for neurotypical people, and the strains of conforming to this world can be very damaging and stressful for them,” adds Hartman.Kirsten Hurley, lecturer in autism studies in UCC, was 22 when she was diagnosed with autism and agrees that masking can be exhausting.“The research would indicate that it has a huge impact on someone’s wellbeing – some people have described it as a social hangover. They are exhausted from it and need to recover,” says Hurley.Before she received her diagnosis, Hurley struggled in school and college and felt there was something wrong with her.She was a bright student, but her behaviour served to frustrate her teachers as opposed to flag her autism.“They thought I was just being badly behaved. I was constantly being told ‘you’re so clever if you just tried harder you could do this or do that’,” she says. “I remember writing an A4 page of all the things that were wrong with me before going in to see a counsellor.”UndiagnosedShe says her life would be very different now if her autism had gone undiagnosed.“I don’t even want to think about it,” says Hurley. “There is no way I would have finished university without a diagnosis because I had to get support from the Disability Support Service.”While some girls may receive a late diagnosis, others are misdiagnosed. “There is a growing body of research linking eating disorders with autism and calling for all girls with eating disorders to at least be screened for autism,” says Hartman.“Many teenage girls who come to us for an eventual autism diagnosis have previous diagnosis of ADD, or anxiety or other mood disorders.”The lower number of girls diagnosed with autism limits the impact they have on how autism is understood.“If you have a group of people for a study and most of them are male and you derive your understanding of autism from that group of people, then you have criteria completely skewed towards the male aspects of autism,” says Hurley.Other studies indicate the existence of gender bias. The research shows that girls were less likely to receive a diagnosis even if their symptoms were as severe as boys.“I think there is a lot of resistance to the idea that girls can have autism,” says Hurley. “People still say to me: ‘autism is really rare in girls, isn’t it?’”Gender is one of the criteria taken into consideration when allocating special education teachers to mainstream schools in Ireland.If the number of girls with autism is higher than those with a diagnosis, are the all girls’ schools at a disadvantage when it comes to supporting their students?Further research the US and the UK also indicates the existence of a gender imbalance in referrals to an educational psychology service.MythsMyths around autism may also be contributing to the late, misdiagnosis or non-diagnosis of girls with autism.“There is a myth or misconception that autistic people lack empathy. But this is just that, a myth,” says Hartman. “The autistic girls, and boys, that I know are generally extremely sensitive, in fact experiencing an over-empathy, which is very difficult for them to cope with day to day.”People with autism can display impairments in areas of social interaction, communication and in restricted interests and repetitive behaviour.Girls’ ability to mirror play can mask social and communication impairments. And, while they may have restricted interests, the nature of that interest may not raise a flag.“They’ll often tend to like similar things to the other girls in their class and that might be another factor in preventing them being picked up by people,” says Hartman.When Lily was growing up, for example, her intense interest was One Direction. “It looked normal to me, you’d expect them to be into ‘boy bands’,” says her father.Girls may succeed in camouflaging their autism in the early years, but it becomes increasingly difficult as they get older and social interactions become more complex.“Autistic girls, as teenagers, I think are very vulnerable,” says Hurley, “We don’t have a safety curriculum, we don’t talk about safety in relationships, that is kind of information that’s passed between people’s peers and if you don’t have that peer group then you miss that information.”This is something that weighs heavy on Lily’s father’s mind.The reasons for the late or under-diagnosis of females with autism can be debated, but the lack of access to services and therapies is indisputable.Lily, who was diagnosed aged 12, has yet to access any services.“We haven’t even had a phone call,” says Jon. “There has to be more support, it has to be quicker. I have no idea when I am going to get a letter in the door to tell me she has an appointment.”Autism and education: in numbers 14,000 – estimated number of Irish students in school population with autism4:1 – estimated proportion of boys versus girls diagnosed with autism in US1 in 65 – estimated proportion of Irish students in school population with autismSources: National Council for Special Education and US CDC.Undiagnosed autism among adults: ‘Many are socially isolated, not able to work and not able to access a diagnosis’Fiona Ferris, deputy chief executive of the autism charity AsIAm, says that when adults finally receive a diagnosis, it can be a difficult and bitter-sweet discovery.“There is an awakening because they think ‘finally know who I am’ but then a grieving because they imagine what it would have been like if they had known all these years, and then the lack of support that follows. They are not a priority because it is felt they made it this far without support,” says Ferris.She says there is no diagnostic public process for adults on the spectrum.“You could go to a GP and be referred to a public psychiatrist. But I know a lot of autistic adults, many of whom have been diagnosed in recent years, and each one of them has had to go privately, and even at that there is just a handful of psychiatrists or psychologists in Ireland who focus on adult diagnosis. Public route to a diagnosis really is not an option for an adult,” she says.Ferris says research indicates that between 80-85 per cent of autistic adults are long-term unemployed or underemployed.“This means that if you are an adult seeking an autism diagnosis there is an 80-85 per cent chance that you are unemployed which means you’re not in a financial position to afford this assessment,” she says.“Everyone should have the access to support themselves and understand themselves better without having to pay for it. There is a lot of money involved in private assessments. Everyone should have access to a public assessment for autism whether you’re a two-year- old or an 82-year-old.“How many adults are still socially isolated, not able to work and not able to access a diagnosis because they don’t have the money for it?”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing.

Mr Harris is to brief Cabinet on Ireland’s preparedness today.New measures to combat the spread of Covid-19 are also likely to be announced following a meeting of the National Public Health Emergency Team, which will be considering fresh advice from the European Centre for Disease Control.The emergency team will also bring forward recommendations on limiting mass gatherings due to public health concerns over the virus, which may impinge on St Patrick’s Festival and other upcoming public events. It is also likely to recommend the transfer of testing of suspected cases from hospital emergency departments to the community.Cases have now been confirmed in 18 out of 27 EU states, and 28 EU citizens have died. There are 89,068 confirmed cases of the illness globally, 2,199 of them in Europe, and more than 3,000 deaths, the bulk of them in China.The OECD on yesterday warned that the virus could halve global economic growth this year from its previous forecast. The Paris-based group lowered its central growth forecast from 2.9 per cent to 2.4 per cent, but said a “longer-lasting and more intensive coronavirus outbreak” could slash annual growth to 1.5 per cent.Google measuresGoogle has told most of its 8,000 Irish staff and contractors to work from home today after a member of staff reported flu-like symptoms.Ryanair announced it was cutting flights for three weeks from the middle of this month as the virus outbreak hits bookings. The airline told passengers it would cut its short-haul flight programme, mainly to and from Italy, by up to 25 per cent from March 17th to April 8th.It blamed a “significant drop in the bookings over that late Marchearly April period, in response to the Covid-19 virus” for its decision and said a significant number of passengers were not showing up for flights, particularly those to and from Italy.Mr Harris said that although heightened awareness of the virus was “a good thing”, there was “no room for complacency or panic” in Ireland’s reaction to it.Despite the European agency’s upgrading the threat of transmission of the disease in Europe to “moderate to high”, Irish public health officials continue to insist they do not expect this to happen in the State.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said he was confident only a “small numbers of sporadic cases” would occur.School closedMr Harris defended the decision of authorities not to name the Dublin school that was closed after one of its students contracted the coronavirus. More than 400 students of the school started two weeks off on Monday after public health officials ordered it to shut to prevent the spread of the disease.Mr Harris described the decision, which has been widely criticised on social media, as proportionate and evidence-based. “It is our job to provide information that is in the public interest it is not our job to provide information the public is interested in. That is a different test.”The process of tracing contacts of the person has been completed and the school has been cleaned, public health officials said, adding that family members of students in the school are free to continue their daily routine as normal.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald confirmed in a video posted on Twitter that her children attend the affected school.Meanwhile, the Department of Foreign Affairs warned Irish citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to Iran due to the spread of the coronavirus there, making it the second country, after China, to be subject to a travel warning from the department since the virus outbreak began."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Mary Laffoy tells documentary government \u0026lsquoresistance\u0026rsquo led to resignation from abuse commissionIrish Water estimates 180,000 homes could be affected by the potentially harmful pipesOne judge recalls jury members being bribedHarris warns the disease may be \u0027with us for a considerable period of time\u0027NCBI and Vision Sports merger will enhance services, says athlete and board member Jason SmythIndependent living facility to be located at former Rosslare Port Lodge Hotel siteAlan Kelly and Aodh\u0026aacuten \u0026Oacute R\u0026iacuteord\u0026aacutein both suggest it is a mistake to exclude party from processAlan Kelly and Aodh\u0026aacuten \u0026Oacute Riord\u0026aacutein under no illusions about scale of challenge facing partyUpdated: Public health team to decide on Tuesday if large public events can proceedSome of firm\u0026rsquos irish-based employees asked to self-isolate as a precautionary measureTen former TDs among Fianna F\u0026aacuteil candidates as nominations for vocational panels closeMichael D.

File image: Colin Keegan, Collins DublinSiblings and parents of students in the Dublin school closed due to the coronavirus are free to continue their daily routine as normal, public health officials have said.Family members and others in the community are not regarded as contacts of the students in the school for infection control purposes, according to chief medical officer at the Department of Health Dr Tony Holohan.In a letter sent to parents of all schoolchildren across the State, Dr Holohan says the decision to close the school for 14 days was a precautionary one and arose because pupils and teachers may have had direct contact with the confirmed case.The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) made the decision to close the Dublin school after learning that the first person in the Republic to test positive for the virus had became ill after returning from Italy and going back to school. He is currently in isolation in a hospital in the capital.More than 400 students of the school on Monday began two weeks off after public health officials ordered it to shut to prevent the spread of the disease.“We’re not concerned about contacts of contacts. They don’t need to stay off school or away from other activities,” deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn told a media briefing on Monday evening.All the contacts of the person who has the infection have now been contacted, officials said, and the school premises have been cleaned.The risk of onward transmission of the disease to those in the school remains low, according to Dr John Cuddihy, head of the Health Protection Suveillance Centre.No new cases have been confirmed in the Republic since the first one reported on Sunday, Dr Holohan said.The European Centre for Disease Control has upgraded the threat of sustain transmission of the disease in Europe to “moderate to high”. However, Dr Holohan said that while he expects further cases in Ireland, these are likely to be “sporadic”.Separately, some schools have also been advising pupils to bring to classes with them a wash bag containing a bar of soap, a small towel or face cloth and a packet of tissues andor hand sanitiser.Similar advice was given to schools during the swine flu outbreak in 200910.Minister for Health Simon Harris defended the decision of authorities not to name the school, describing it as proportionte and evidence-based.“It is our job to provide information that is in the public interest it is not our job to provide information the public is interested in. That is a different test,” he said.The State’s chief medical officer, Dr Tony Holohan, had earlier pointed out that confidentiality must be maintained so the public would feel confident about coming forward if they thought they might have contracted the virus.A series of measures had been outlined to parents of pupils at the school urging the students to limit their social interactions and not to attend social gatherings.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald confirmed in a video posted on Twitter that her children attend the affected school. This had been reported by a tabloid newspaper on Monday morning.“This is a worrying time for families and for the staff at the school, particularly for the family of the person affected and we wish them a very, very speedy recovery,” she said.“I’ve had to reorganise everything and all of my work schedule because of this, and so the public meetings in Cavan and in Galway this week will unfortunately have to be postponed, but we will set a date for them again very, very soon,” Ms McDonald said, adding she would be back at work on Tuesday.MisinformationMr Harris said any publicity that results in the naming of a child was entirely inappropriate. The advice to students on restricting their movements for 14 days does not apply to family members, he added.The Minister also criticised the spread of misinformation on social media about the case, saying information had been put out that could have led to the identification of a child. In addition, rumours had gone around on Sunday that “school x or school y” was affected.The Health Service Executive was due to hold a meeting on Monday evening for parents of the school, who will also be texted daily to check on symptoms so there can be immediate action and follow up if necessary.“We felt this was a proportionate measure, in the event that someone else becomes ill, they can be diagnosed quickly,” Dr Holohan said .The senior health official said he understood the impact this could have on families with parents potentially having to take time off work to care for their child, and said it was a decision not been taken lightly.Minister for Health Simon Harris defended the HSE’s decision not to publicly name the affected school.In a post on Twitter he said health officials “have to protect anyone who comes forward with symptoms of coronavirus.”“They are acting in the public interest and helping our national and global efforts to contain this virus. Contact tracing ensures anyone who needs to know knows,” he said.A spokesman for the Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) said schools forced to close for two weeks following coronavirus cases should be able to make up lost teaching time upon reopening.“When schools have been forced to close in the past for a period of time due to extreme weather or other health and safety risks, upon opening again they would typically choose to prioritise tuition over non-tuition activities,” the spokesman said.This could include “reducing the length of mock or in-house examinations,” and prioritising classroom learning over planned field trips or tours, he said. “And they might seek to ensure that students in examination years attend all classes to the end of the final school term,” the union spokesman said.Dr Holohan said decisions from sports clubs near the school to cancel training sessions were unnecessary.The HSE will find ways to work with all organisations to help provide responses that were proportionate, he said.He warned that social media had highlighted concerns that had no basis in fact. “Anyone with access to social media, has access to hse.ie for accurate information,” he said.Some of the information being shared on social media was “completely false” and the public should rely only on “trusted sources,” he said.St Patrick’s DayDr Holohan said this was a fast changing situation and it was difficult to predict what might be of concern in 10 days time, and the impact on large gatherings such as the St Patrick’s Day parade.The chief medical officer was also adamant that the country had sufficient hospital isolation rooms, and pointed out most people who had been infected elsewhere had experienced only a mild infection and symptoms.Asked about the possibility of people being infected a second time, Dr Holohan said this was “an open scientific question” as there was much still unknown about the virus.Public health officials are expected to decide on Tuesday on restrictions that will apply to mass gatherings in light of the worldwide coronavirus outbreak. The restrictions to be decided by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) may affect the St Patrick’s Day Festival and other big events such as concerts and sports matches over the coming months.Last week a decision was taken to cancel the Ireland vs Italy Six Nations rugby match, due to take place in the Aviva Stadium this Saturday. This came after a significant outbreak of the coronavirus in parts of northern Italy.The NPHET made the decision to close the Dublin school upon learning that the first person in the Republic to test positive for the virus had became ill after returning from Italy and going back to school. He is currently in isolation in a hospital in the capital.Travel adviceMeanwhile, the Department of Foreign Affairs has warned Irish citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to Iran due to the spread of the coronavirus there.Iran thus becomes the second country, after China, to be subject to a travel warning from the Department since the virus outbreak began at the start of this year.In revised travel advice published on its website, the Department refers to the “high number” of coronavirus cases confirmed in the country - which currently stands at 978. With 54 deaths from the disease, Iran also has one of the highest mortality rates in international terms.The Department says many flight routes from Iran have been cancelled. “Several international commercial flights remain operational, although some have restrictions in place regarding which citizens they will carry.”Many land border crossings between Iran and surrounding countries have been closed, including those with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Turkey and Pakistan.The Department also advises against travel to provinces in Iran that border with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq due to the “persistently dangerous security situation” in these areas.The Department has advised against all non-essential travel to China, and against all travel to the Chinese province of Hubei, where the outbreak started.A spokesman said the Department continued to review and update its travel advice as required, in close cooperation with Irish embassies, EU partners and relevant Government departments.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4190769.1583186764!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"google staff in dublin told to stay at home after worker shows flu like symptoms","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGoogle, which has 8,000 employees in Dublin, is also testing its wider preparedness by initiating a company-wide work from home day on Tuesday.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe .President Michael D. Higgins has warned that the capacity of universities to provide a “moral space” for discussion is being eroded at a time of growing political populism.Mr Higgins, who was opening a celebration of Trinity College Dublin’s College Historical Debating Society, said “universities are not there merely to produce students who are useful”.“They are there to produce citizens who are respectful of the rights of others to participate and also to be able to participate fully, drawing on a wide range of scholarship,” he said on Monday night.The President said there is a growing cohort of people who are alienated and “who feel they have lost their attachment to society and decision making”.He explicitly targeted US president Donald Trump’s political sloganeering, saying these alienated voters “can become available for others who come and say to them ‘I want to be your voice’.”Mr Higgins said universities are relied upon “to create that moral space where people will be able to evaluate different suggestions”.Asked by his interviewer, the broadcaster and historian John Bowman, if he feared that capacity was being eroded, the President said “I do, straight up”.“We have a fractured society and the university is the place to where you would go for putting things back together in relation to discursive options,” he told a crowd assembled in Trinity’s Examinations Hall.He said universities and academics had become overly focused on the market, because of a sense that there was “magic happening in the marketplace… when in fact actually what you had was a whole series of vulgar chancers”.The College Historical Society, or “the Hist”, claims to be the world’s oldest undergraduate society and is running a week-long series of events to mark its 250th anniversary.Recalling his debating days in university, the President said debating is “a life-changing experience, most people who have done it will remember the very first time they debated and the sensation it caused”.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4190788.1583180443!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pressure from coronavirus brexit and sf surge may push ff and fg together","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar has again called for other parties to form a government. File photograph: Nick BradshawThe Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Monday released a video message again urging other parties to form a government. But coming a day after he wrote an article in the Sunday Independent attacking Sinn Féin and accusing it of encouraging online hate speech and of financial irregularities, Fianna Fáil sources asked how Varadkar could reasonably expect any other party to form a government with Sinn Féin.In his article, Varadkar also said that Sinn Féin had not fully embraced “our constitutional democracy” and that describing the State as the “Free State” or the “Southern State” – as many Sinn Féin TDs do – was “like burning a Tricolour before our eyes”.Nevertheless, meaningful discussions on a government between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil still appear as far away as ever, despite recent private contacts between prominent members of both.Delegations from the two parties are expected to meet this week for a “policy exchange” before the Dáil assembles again on Thursday, but there is as yet no sign of full discussions on a possible coalition.Both Government and Fianna Fáil sources, however, say they expect outside events to push the two parties towards meaningful negotiations after St Patrick’s Day.They believe that the worsening coronavirus outbreak will increase the pressure to form a government. Although there are only two recorded cases of the virus in Ireland at present, more are expected.Economic effectsMeanwhile, the economic effects of the measures taken to combat the possibility of a pandemic are already having an effect, with stock market jitters and downgraded economic forecasts.In Brussels, the negotiations on a new trade agreement between the UK and the EU got under way after a period of sabre-rattling in London and tough talk in response from EU institutions and member states.Failure to agree a deal would once again raise the prospect of a no-deal Brexit at the end of this year, with some analysts suggesting that such an outcome is now much more likely.Insiders – including some involved in the government formation process – expect that the combined effect of the coronavirus and the return of Brexit to the political agenda will erode public patience and pile pressure on Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to commence real discussions.The poll showing support for Sinn Féin has jumped to 35 per cent since the general election, while support for Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil has fallen, is likely to harden opinion in the two parties against a second general election in the coming months.The options are narrowing for everyone.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4190840.1583184618!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit negotiating teams convene for round one of trade talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChief Brexit negotiators Michel Barnier (right) with David Frost at the start of post-Brexit trade talks. Photograph: APNegotiating teams for Britain and the European Union met for the first round of talks on the future relationship between the bloc and its former member in Brussels on Monday.Chief negotiators Michel Barnier and David Frost held a roundtable meeting together with their teams of dozens of negotiators, opening the first of five rounds of talks due to take place by May that will alternate between Brussels and London.On Tuesday and Wednesday, the talks will ide into 11 groups that will run concurrently, focusing on areas including trade in goods, services and the contested so-called level playing field.Britain hopes to achieve a free-trade deal with the European Union that allows it trade easily with the world’s largest economic bloc. But the EU holds that easy access to its single market can come only with close alignment to its rules and standards, as otherwise UK companies would have an unfair advantage over those of the EU – something that London has ruled out.Other sticking points include fishing rights: an economically puny but politically weighty issue, particularly for countries such as Denmark and France. Britain wants to preserve more of the catch in its territorial waters for its own fishing industry, ending the practice of shared fishing waters, but it relies on EU markets to sell much of its fish.The first round of talks will conclude on Thursday with a meeting of all groups and a bilateral meeting between Barnier and Frost, at which they will take stock of progress made so far.Britain has left the EU and is now in a transitional arrangement, continuing to observe the same norms as before until the end of this year. If no deal can be reached, Britain will begin automatically trading with the EU on World Trade Organisation default terms in January.Brinkmanship politics?Both sides have said they are willing to walk away without a deal, even though this would entail economic damage, particularly for Britain and its closest neighbours including Ireland. Britain has said it will prepare for a no-deal scenario if it judges that insufficient progress has been made by June.But whether or not a deal is struck, Britain has made clear that its ambitions are for a more distant relationship with the EU, even if that comes at an economic price.EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has urged companies to prepare for this by reactivating no-deal Brexit contingency plans.“I am very concerned that there’s not sufficient planning in place presently,” said Hogan. “The last thing we want to see is a logistical nightmare for our exporters at our ports and airports through not being properly prepared.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Eric GayAPMillions of Americans go to the polls on Tuesday to cast their vote for their preferred Democratic presidential nominee, as the field of candidates vying to take on US president Donald Trump in November’s presidential election narrowed dramatically.In a remarkable turn of events, several big name candidates who had been rivals to Joe Biden in the presidential race, threw their support behind the former vice-president on the eve of Super Tuesday, in a bid to unite the moderate wing of the party and stem the rise of Bernie Sanders, who is leading in polls.Having dropped out of the race, both Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg flew to Texas last night to endorse Mr Biden who was campaigning there, one of several states to hold its primary on Tuesday. Former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke, who quit the Democratic race last year, also appeared on stage alongside Mr Biden and endorsed him. Speaking alongside Mr Biden ahead of the rally, Mr Buttigieg said that the former vice-president had the integrity and policy positions that would propel him to the presidency, highlighting his commitment to issues like climate change and gun control. Stressing the “need to bring back dignity to the White House,” Mr Buttigieg said he was urging his supporters to back Mr Biden. “I’m looking for a president who will draw out what is best in each of us, and I’m encouraging everybody who was part of my campaign to join me, because we have found that leader.” In emotional comments alongside Mr Buttigieg, Mr Biden thanked him for his support, comparing him to his son Beau, who died from cancer at the age of 46. “Such enormous character, such intellectual capacity and such a commitment to other people,” Mr Biden (77) said of the former mayor of South Bend, adding that he had already asked him to join his team if he is elected president. Shortly after, Ms Klobuchar joined Mr Biden on stage in Dallas, where she endorsed her former rival. “Joe Biden has dedicated his life for fighting for people , not for the rich or the powerful, but for the mom, for the farmer, for the dreamer, for the veteran,” she said, adding that Mr Biden would govern with his heart as well as his head. “It is a time for a president that will bring decency and dignity back to the White House.”“Joe knows you and he will fight for you. I cannot think of a better way to end my campaign than joining his,” she said. QuittingMr O’Rourke, who has kept a relatively low profile since quitting the race last year, explained why he was backing Mr Biden as he took to the stage at the rally. “We need somebody who can beat Donald Trump. The man in the White House today poses an existential threat to our country, to our democracy to free and fair elections . . . In Joe Biden we have someone who is the antithesis to Donald Trump.” Mr Biden, who failed to capture the public imagination for much of the primary campaign, is hoping to capitalise on his resounding victory in South Carolina on Saturday. He won an impressive 48 per cent of the vote in the southern state, reflecting his strong support among African-American voters.But Vermont senator Mr Sanders – who narrowly lost the 2016 Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton – remains the front-runner going into the Super Tuesday contests. Following victories in New Hampshire and Nevada, as well as winning the popular vote in Iowa, Mr Sanders is well ahead in the polls. Crucially, he is ahead in California – the biggest state in the union, with the largest number of pledged delegates needed to secure the party’s nomination at the Democratic National Convention in July. More than a dozen states across American as well as overseas territories hold primaries today. At his final rally before Super Tuesday in Minnesota on Monday night, Mr Sanders invited the supporters of Ms Klobuchar and Mr Buttigieg to join him. Ms Klobuchar’s decision to withdraw from the race on the eve of Tuesday’s voting is likely to pave the way for Ms Sanders to win her home state of Minnesota. Tuesday will also be the first time former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg will be on the ballot, having made the strategic decision to sit out the first four primary states. The billionaire businessman was continuing to dominate TV advertising across the country on Monday and said he had no plans to drop out. Elizabeth Warren, the only woman left in the race, is hoping to sweep up delegates in several states on Tuesday having not yet won a primary contest. But she could be facing a tough battle in her home state of Massachusetts where Mr Sanders has been rising in the polls and attracting huge crowds at campaign events. The withdrawal of several high-profile centrist candidates in recent days signals an effort to consolidate the moderate wing of the party as Mr Sanders surges ahead. Both Mr Buttigieg and Ms Klobuchar occupy similar ideological ground to Mr Biden, and the former vice-president’s campaign is arguing that he is the best candidate to stop Mr Sanders winning the nomination – an outcome they believe would deliver the election to Mr Trump in November. Mr Biden was attracted a string of endorsements from senior Democrats in recent days, including former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe and former senate Democratic leader Harry Reid. But Mr Sanders has created a formidable ground campaign, rooted in strong support among young voters and Latinos.

There could have been no more fitting spot for a final stand.The billionaire has already given up on winning California, the largest US state. But in Texas, the second biggest, he still has a fighting chance.We really need Texas to get the job done. The road to victory starts right here, right now, he told supporters in an old air force hangar in San Antonio. You\u0027ve all heard the slogan: \u0027Mike will get it done.\u0027 If you haven\u0027t … I’ve wasted an awful lot of money. Mr Bloomberg, 78, the world\u0027s ninth richest man, targeted Texas from the start of his unorthodox campaign (see video below), visiting seven times and carpet-bombing the state\u0027s airwaves. Appearing on stage to U2\u0027s Beautiful Day, he refrained from attacking, or even naming, any of his Democrat rivals, focusing instead on US President Donald Trump.He said: We have a leadership vacuum in the White House. There is a really serious crisis facing our country, and our world, and that is the coronavirus. President Trump buried his head in the sand.This is not a job for an amateur, and he is. Trump\u0027s incompetence really puts us at risk. He\u0027s the definition of ‘all hat and no cattle’. I\u0027m all action and no BS.The former New York mayor went on to describe himself as the un-Trump and vowed to send Donald back to Mar-a-Lago permanently.Addressing his own widely criticised debate performances, Mr Bloomberg said: You could see in the debates I\u0027m not someone who just yells slogans when they\u0027re not true. We need a leader ready to be commander-in-chief, not college-debater-in-chief. I believe we need less talk, less ision, less tweeting. How about no tweeting from the Oval Office ever again?In Texas, it is impossible to turn on a TV without seeing Mr Bloomberg. Some 80 per cent of presidential campaign advertisements are his. Across large swathes of the Lone Star State, he is the only candidate on air.One Spanish-language advertisement, repeated endlessly, cost $4.3 million. It says Mr Bloomberg has la fuerza para enfrentar a Trump - the strength to face Trump. A third of Texas voters are Hiic.The resulting poll numbers have been reasonably encouraging for Mr Bloomberg, placing him in an effective tie for second place with Joe Biden but trailing Bernie Sanders. However, experts say those numbers could be soft - meaning people like what they see in the advertisements but won\u0027t get round to voting.Mr Bloomberg\u0027s campaign points out that he also has by far the biggest ground game in Texas, with 19 field offices and 180 staff, many more than Mr Sanders. The candidate says he has also eaten a lot of Texas brisket while meeting voters.But when it comes to drawing crowds, there is no comparison with Mr Sanders, who previously barnstormed the state, including packing out a rodeo arena.By contrast, barely a few hundred people turned up at to see Mr Bloomberg. It was less than the number that tried to defend the Alamo.But I\u0027m still putting all my eggs in one basket because I believe this guy can beat Trump. I like Bernie and Biden, but we need to go with someone who has a chance.Mike Mullen, 72, a Vietnam veteran, said: I used to be a Republican but Trump\u0027s ruining the country. I came here to take a look, and Mike\u0027s got my vote. He’ll do better than people think.Mr Bloomberg\u0027s juggernaut of a campaign has been built by the very best data and advertising experts. His field organisers are being paid $6,000 a month, more than the average family income in Texas. He has spent an estimated $528 million on advertising alone.The top-down structure of the campaign is the opposite of Mr Sanders\u0027 organic movement.However, it appeals to those with a yearning, not for excitement and revolution but for competence and stability.In San Antonio, it was a serious, cerebral crowd. There were no baseball hats and, despite it being Texas, not a single Stetson. No one chants or dances wildly at a Bloomberg rally. If they feel the Bloom, they do so quietly.But they do go home satisfied that they have seen a man who knows what he is doing and what he is talking about.There was a similar reaction when Mr Bloomberg appeared last week at a Women for Mike rally in Virginia, where he is also polling well. The event was a response to allegations that he had made derogatory comments to women working at his media company, which he has denied.The middle-class audience, many dressed in “I Like Mike” T-shirts, snacked on chocolate croissants and fruit skewers in a hotel ballroom 10 miles from the White House.I think he actually is charismatic, but he\u0027s just not used to debating on TV, said Roberta Russell, 76, an author who brought along her champion poodle, Lexis Cathexus. He’s a fine man. He\u0027s highly educated and he’s reached a stage in life where all he wants to do is give. That\u0027s very admirable.Julianne Fanning, in her 50s and retired from working at the World Bank, volunteered to knock on doors. She said: We’ve lost credibility abroad. We need an honest broker in the White House.For Mr Bloomberg, the question is whether his appeal to voters\u0027 heads, rather than their hearts, can succeed. On Super Tuesday on March 3, where 14 states will cast their votes to nominate, he will find out whether competence and stability is enough of a draw.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive dirty banknotes may spreading coronavirus world health","story":"Banknotes may be spreading the new coronavirus so people should try to use contactless payments instead, the World Health Organisation has said.Customers should wash their hands after touching banknotes because infectious Covid-19 may cling to the surface for a number of days, the UN agency warned on Monday night.To prevent the spread of the disease, people should use contactless technology where possible, a spokesman added.Last night the Bank of England acknowledged that banknotes “can carry bacteria or viruses” and urged people to regularly wash their hands.It comes after both China and Korea last month began disinfecting and isolating used banknotes as part of efforts to stop the spread of the disease.Officials used ultraviolet light or high temperatures to sterilise the bills, only putting them back into circulation after they had been sealed and stored for up to 14 days. A source at the Bank of England insisted there were no plans to do the same in the UK.However the World Health Organisation last night warned that the British public should exercise care when handling potentially infectious banknotes.“We know that money changes hands frequently and can pick up all sorts of bacteria and viruses,” a spokesman told the .“We would advise people to wash their hands after handling banknotes, and avoid touching their face.“When possible it would also be advisable to use contactless payments to reduce the risk of transmission.”Exactly how long the new coronavirus can survive outside the human body has not yet been proven.An analysis of 22 earlier studies of similar coronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) published online this month in the Journal of Hospital Infection, concluded that human coronaviruses can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces for up to nine days at room temperature.However, they can quickly be rendered inactive using common disinfectants, and may also dissipate at higher temperatures, the authors wrote. It is not yet clear, however, whether the new coronavirus behaves in a similar way.A Bank of England spokesman said: “Like any other surface that large numbers of people come into contact with, notes can carry bacteria or viruses. However, the risk posed by handling a polymer note is no greater than touching any other common surface, such as handrails, doorknobs or credit cards.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"female director ftse 100 firm sacked 200k job did not discuss","story":"Talking about football has long been commonplace inside Britain\u0027s offices with opinions on the beautiful game a seemingly endless source of debate.But while sales director Adrienne Liebenberg watched on as her male colleagues bonded over their interest in the sport, she claims her apparent non-enthusiasm led to her being alienated and eventually dismissed.The businesswoman, who was paid £200,000-a-year by FTSE 100 firm DS Smith, an international packaging conglomerate based in London, has told an employment tribunal she was a victim of sexism.Ms Liebenberg joined the firm in March 2017 as its director of global sales and marketing but said she was soon marginalised because she didn’t partake in conversations about football or involve herself in office banter.She was dismissed from her role in December 2018 after being told that her leadership style was not working.Ms Liebenberg, who previously worked at oil and gas giant BP Castrol, has taken her former employers to an employment tribunal, arguing that she was sacked because of her gender.The company denies the accusation. In a statement read out at the tribunal, Ms Liebenberg claimed business decisions were often taken over boozy dinners with a gang of senior male employees, whose practice consisted of bonding, drink, and football.Ms Liebenberg added that she found it difficult to join in with these events, because she felt alienated by the focus on drinking, and talking about football, and starting up late.The tribunal heard tensions grew particularly between Ms Liebenberg and her line manager Stefano Rossi, the company\u0027s Packaging CEO.She told the tribunal: I felt that Stefano\u0027s modus operandi was to connect with his team over wine, dinner and football.Because I did not embrace those things in the way that my male colleagues did, I was perceived - by Stefano and others - as not being a \u0027team player\u0027 or \u0027one of the gang\u0027.Ms Liebenberg claimed Mr Rossi was a huge football fan, and would often interrupt meetings to discuss football or watch highlights.She added: I cannot remember a single day of meetings at which we went the whole day without Stefano watching football matches, or videos of parts of matches, on his phone or following football scores and interrupting meetings with an update or to discuss Inter Milan or a particular player.Expressing surprise at how male-dominated DS Smith was, Ms Liebenberg noted that she was often the only woman in the room.Out of 35 leadership roles in sales and operational positions at the company, only eight were reportedly filled by women Mr Rossi and his senior colleagues at DS Smith, some of whom, including CEO Miles Roberts, are respondents to the discrimination claim, are adamant that Ms Liebenberg was sacked because of poor performance rather than sexism.In a statement to the tribunal, Mr Rossi said Ms Liebenberg\u0027s dismissal was down to her dictatorial approach and lack of respect for senior colleagues. Mr Rossi added the company had sought a different leadership style following Ms Liebenberg\u0027s departure, and criticised the former director for not being collegial with other employees. The firm, Mr Rossi, Mr Roberts and HR director Tim Ellis all deny sex discrimination.

Just one person, who may not even show symptoms, could infect the rest of the audience.“This is not the type of publicity anyone wants,” the letter said.In common with cold and flu viruses, coronavirus is spread via droplets when a person coughs or sneezes.The droplets land on surfaces and are picked up on the hands of others and spread further.People catch the virus when they touch their infected hands to their mouth, nose or eyes.The government has refused to rule out the prospect of whole cities going into lockdown where significant clusters of uncontained coronavirus emerge.Announcing a \u0027war room battle plan\u0027 on Monday, Boris Johnson, he said \u0027population-distancing measures\u0027 may become necessary.These are expected to include the banning of public gatherings, cancelling football matches and closing schools.Various English football clubs have already introduced their own bans on handshaking.Newcastle Football Club announced last week it had suspended its cherished pre-training handshaking ritual - although the team did shake hands with Burnley players at their Premier League match on Saturday.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"moderate drop outs give joe biden major boost super tuesday","story":"Joe Biden’s hopes of beating Bernie Sanders to the Democratic presidential nomination have got a major boost after a string of moderate rivals dropped out just before Super Tuesday when 14 states vote. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator, became the third centrist candidate to quit the race in as many days after deciding there was no path to victory, following former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg and billionaire Tom Steyer.Ms Klobuchar, who finished a surprisingly strong third in New Hampshire but has otherwise struggled to break through, was expected to endorse Mr Biden and appear with him on stage last night. The clearing of the field helps Mr Biden, the former US vice president who is in the ascendant after a blowout win in South Carolina, as he fights to prove he is the best placed to beat Mr Sanders, a self-styled democratic socialist. In another boost for Mr Biden, Mr Buttigieg endorsed Mr Biden on Monday.I\u0027m looking for a president who will draw out what is best in each of us, and I\u0027m encouraging everybody who was part of my campaign to join me because we have found that leader in vice president, soon-to-be-president, Joe Biden, Mr Buttigieg said in Dallas, with Mr Biden standing nearby.Super Tuesday is the most consequential day of voting left in the race, with a third of all delegates - the metric that will determine the winner - up for grabs. California has the most delegates on offer by some distance, followed by Texas. Mike Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and billionaire, is under growing pressure to prove he is better placed than Mr Biden to beat Mr Sanders, who centrist Democrats fear would lose to Donald Trump given his left-wing platform. Mr Bloomberg will finally be on the ballot after skipping the early states, providing evidence of whether his unprecedented half a billion dollars of campaign spending, predominantly on advertising, has converted into votes. The two other candidates still in the race, Elizabeth Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, and Tulsi Gabbard, the Hawaii congresswoman who has made little impact, are both also facing serious questions about viability. Ms Klobuchar’s withdrawal means all the leading candidates are in their seventies - Mr Biden is 77, Mr Bloomberg and Mr Sanders are 78, Ms Warren is 70. The winner will take on Mr Trump, 73, in November’s presidential election. Mr Sanders is the front-runner and will still be hoping to secure a big delegate lead after Tuesday’s voting, not least because polls suggest he is way out ahead in California, which alone has a tenth of all delegates available in the nationwide race. Mr Sanders was in Los Angeles, California, on Sunday night holding a raucous rally attended by more than 10,000 supporters and featuring well-known names from Hollywood and the music industry. Dick Van Dyke, the 94-year-old actor from Mary Poppins, Sarah Silverman, a comedian, and Chuck D, the Public Enemy rapper, all took to the stage to urge Californians to vote for Mr Sanders. Van Dyke joked about concerns over the 78-year-old candidate’s age, saying he was probably getting married the day Mr Sanders was born. Chuck D got the crowd to raise their fists as he sung ‘Fight the Power\u0027 - a line that echoes the Sanders campaign message. Mr Sanders played up his “not me, us” slogan, used in a bid that frames itself as a movement rather than a campaign, saying: “My family cares for your family, your family cares for my family. We’re in it together.” He also stressed the importance of the state, saying: “The candidate who wins in California has an exceptional chance to win the Democratic nomination.”Chants of “Bernie! Bernie!” rang out from the crowd, who waved blue and white posters with the candidate’s name on. David Nesbitt, a 54-year-old in a Bernie T-shirt who attended, rejected the idea a centrist candidate was the safest best. But Mr Biden, campaigning in Texas on Monday, issued a rebuke of the Sanders pitch, saying: We can win big or lose big, that\u0027s the choice that\u0027s upon us now. He added: Most Americans don\u0027t want a promise of revolution, they want a guarantee of results on what affects them. Biden campaign figures were  calling the candidate\u0027s resurgence the Biden bounce back and Joementum in media interviews on Monday. Mr Buttigieg, the 38-year-old relative unknown who came in the top two in Iowa and New Hampshire, used a farewell speech to criticise Mr Sanders, though not by name. Mr Buttigieg warned against becoming lost in ideology and called for a broad and inclusive politics, hinting at concerns he voiced about factionalism from the Sanders campaign. Around a dozen more states will vote in March after Super Tuesday. A candidate who gets 1,991 delegates will have won a majority. The eventual nominee is formally adopted at a convention in July. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"onshore wind farms brought back government contracts","story":"Dozens of new wind farms could be built after the Government on Monday reversed its effective four-year ban on subsidies for onshore wind, to help reach its climate change targets.David Cameron’s government fulfilled an election promise to end subsidies for “unsightly” wind farms in 2016, after calls from more than 100 mostly Conservative MPs.Polling since then has shown 78 per cent of the British public support onshore wind, with support among Conservative voters at 74 per cent.The Government is under pressure to deliver on its legally binding promise to reach net zero by 2050, particularly as it hosts the COP26 international climate summit in November this year.The impact of the end to subsidies was revealed last year in figures that showed only 23 wind farms started generating electricity, compared with 405 in 2014.Secretary of State for Business and Energy Alok Sharma on Monday said: “Ending our contribution to climate change means making the UK a world leader in renewable energy.”The price of onshore wind is expected to compete with that of offshore to become the cheapest new energy source in the UK, and deliver lower energy bills to consumers.Six signatories of a 2012 letter to Mr Cameron were among more than 150 Conservatives MPs to write to Boris Johnson last year and call for subsidies to be reopened to onshore wind.In another sign of growing support for onshore wind, the CPRE, which has previously been a vocal opponent of wind farms for their impact on landscapes and wildlife, welcomed Monday\u0027s announcement, saying “the climate emergency is the single greatest threat to our countryside.”But it also cautioned that “local communities must be at the heart of shaping the future of their energy landscapes”.There are believed to be 86 wind farm projects that have already received planning permission and could be generating electricity by the mid-2020s.The vast majority - 74 - are in Scotland, where the government has backed onshore wind, and planning regulations mean developers do not need to secure the consent of local communities. Just one is in England, and 11 are in Wales.The Government has promised communities will be given a “more effective voice” in making decisions on whether onshore wind farms can go ahead across the UK, but it will not change current planning regulations.The move was welcomed by environmental campaigners. Greenpeace said the announcement was “great news for anyone who pays an energy bill, and it\u0027s great news for our climate.”The plans announced by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy yesterday will allow onshore wind and solar producers to bid for a long-term guaranteed price from next year.The price for offshore wind contracts last year reached a record low £40 per megawatt hour, cheaper than existing gas-fired power stations, and comparing to £92.50 per MWh from the planned Hinkley Point station.RenewableUK, an industry body, estimates that onshore wind could save households £50 a year on energy bills by 2035 and could provide 26,500 jobs in construction and maintenance.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/03/TELEMMGLPICT000000614099_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqF9BD_fYQB0teZOF4IslN2e-1GfDAhkIiYfGM5dxxlc4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"must never forget debt owe veterans peace freedom","story":"The 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe this May is an opportunity to remember the great sacrifices made in securing peace on the continentOn 8 May 1945, after six long years of bitter struggle, Sir Winston Churchill addressed the cheering crowds on Whitehall. His words that day still retain a mesmeric power, 75 years on: “My dear friends, this is your hour. This is not victory of a party or of any class. It’s a victory of the great British nation as a whole.”The 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe this May is an opportunity to remember the great sacrifices made in securing peace on the continent. The Government is proud to be working closely with veterans’ organisations to hold a series of major events to mark this historic milestone, in which veterans of the Second World War – many of whom I was privileged to meet when I served as a young officer in the Scots Guards – will be the VIPs. As the community of surviving veterans gets tragically smaller each year, it is ever more important to recognise and remember their service.The VE Day commemorations on May 8 will demonstrate how the “Greatest Generation” continues to inspire those who put themselves in harm’s way to protect the UK on operations around the world. The Red Arrows and the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight will lead aircraft from the Navy, Army and Royal Air Force in a flypast over London, while hundreds of service personnel will support veterans taking part in a procession down the Mall.There is no doubt that Churchill, as he delivered his moving words to joyful crowds in London on VE Day, would have thought with great sadness of those still labouring thousands of miles away. The war continued to cast a great shadow over the Far East for several months as British troops joined the world’s largest army to take on the Japanese in Burma. They were often dubbed the “forgotten army”, and it’s high time they enjoyed their day in the sun.Field Marshal William Slim, who led the 14th Army in Burma during the Far East campaign, was under no illusions about how much the Allied forces owed to these troops from around the world. “So great were the idends that could accrue,” he confessed, “that I asked for the impossible – and got it!”To mark the 75th anniversary of VJ Day in August, there will be events in London and at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, home to memorials to Far East Prisoners of War and those forced to build the Burma Railway. The Government is proud to be working alongside the Royal British Legion to organise these commemorations. The charity is also preparing to help veterans of the Far East campaign return to the Asia-Pacific to pay tribute to those who never came home. For many it will be the first time they have had the opportunity to return to battlefields where they lost their comrades.When we think back to the Second World War, we often laud our leaders, our brilliant generals, or the extraordinary bravery of 181 Victoria Cross recipients. But these anniversaries are also our chance to remind ourselves of ordinary people who did extraordinary things, from the code-crackers and bridge-builders to the pioneers of radar and sonar.I think again and again of Geoffrey Pidgeon, an MI6 officer who played a pivotal role in the D-Day landings. His extraordinary achievements in the service of his country show how the brilliance and expertise of every section of society was necessary to restore peace in Europe.Last October Geoffrey was awarded the Légion d’honneur, France’s highest honour. I was proud to see him receive his award and recount with extraordinary modesty the story of his service. Our allies haven’t forgotten these unsung great British heroes. Nor should we.I call on every reader who may know a veteran of the Second World War to reach out to them and encourage them to register their interest to take part in the commemorations this summer. Please visit the website of The Royal British Legion to sign up.The debt we owe for the peace and freedom we now enjoy will never be forgotten.

Our smartphone-based method provides a more robust assessment, ensuring serious cases do not go unnoticed. While we await the evidence of a larger trial, we believe that this method, used as an app, could help to prevent the deaths of newborn babies due to severe jaundice worldwide.”Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Troops set up makeshift partitions and beds at the Armed Forces Hospital in Daegu South Korea 28 February 2020China’s economy will suffer a severe, short-lived downturn, with growth dropping from 6.1 per cent in 2019 to less than 5 per cent this year before recovering in 2021, according to the OECD.“The virus risks giving a further blow to a global economy that was already weakened by trade and political tensions,” said OECD chief economist Laurence Boone.“Governments need to act immediately to contain the epidemic, support the health care system, protect people, shore up demand and provide a financial lifeline to households and businesses that are most affected.”To mitigate the economic fallout, employees should be allowed to work from home, the OECD said. It urged governments to\u0026nbspstep in to support sectors most affected\u0026nbspsuch as travel and tourism, and the car and electronics industries.It also called for central banks to provide extra liquidity to banks so\u0026nbspthey can help businesses suffering immediate cashflow problems.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIf the epidemic spreads widely, the G20 economies should lead an internationally coordinated framework for health care support, combined with coordinated fiscal and monetary stimulus to rebuild confidence, the OECD’s report said.Amid trade tensions and political uncertainty, Europe and Japan were already growing slowly before the new coronavirus began to spread.The prospect of a pandemic sparked a\u0026nbsprapid sell-off on\u0026nbspstock markets around the globe last week as investors weighed up the impact of factory shutdowns, cancelled flights and disruption to the supply of goods.The FTSE 100\u0026nbspregained some of the lost ground on Monday morning, trading 1 per cent up on Friday’s close.\u0026nbspMarkets will gain little comfort from the OECD’s report or from separate data showing a slump in Chinese manufacturing.Factory activity plunged in February at its fastest rate and to its lowest level on record as anti-virus controls brought some production lines to a standstill.A monthly purchasing managers’ index released by Caixin magazine fell to 40.3 from January’s 51.1. A reading below 50 indicates output is shrinking.With many companies and countries reliant on imports of goods from China, the slowdown will begin to impact supplies globally in the coming weeks and months.Its central or “base” scenario is that global economic growth will be 2.4 per cent this year, down from the 2.9 per cent it had forecast as recently as November. However, it also warns that the economic impact from coronavirus remains very uncertain and growth could fall much further, to 1.5 per cent this year.Much of this downward revision results from a slowdown in China where factories and cities have been shut down to contain the virus. Countries strongly interconnected with China, such as Japan, Australia and South Korea, will also experience economic damage, the OECD says.The organisation\u0026nbspthinks the most likely scenario is that the effects of the virus will fade relatively soon. If the countries most exposed to coronavirus take effective\u0026nbspaction to mitigate the impact of coronavirus, global growth could rebound to 3.4 per cent next year.The OECD says: “A longer lasting and more intensive coronavirus outbreak, spreading widely throughout the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America, would weaken prospects considerably.”In this scenario, economies in Europe and North America will also experience significant economic fallout from the virus.Demand is likely to be significantly hit across much of the world for an extended period, with countries accounting for 70 per cent of global GDP likely to be affected.Other countries may not fully replicate\u0026nbspChina’s tough restrictions on movement, but\u0026nbspmany of the economic impacts are likely to be similar.\u0026nbspThis would\u0026nbspsignificantly damage\u0026nbspconfidence, causing heightened uncertainty, while\u0026nbspvoluntary\u0026nbsprestraints on travel and commercial and sporting events are all likely to depress spending.On Sunday, the UK health secretary Matt Hancock refused to rule out shutting down cities if the virus spreads widely in the country.\u0026nbspMr Hancock\u0026nbspsaid he would not take anything “off the table at this stage” when asked about a\u0026nbspWuhan-style\u0026nbspquarantine\u0026nbspby BBC’s Andrew Marr.“There’s clearly a huge economic and social downside to that but we don’t take anything off the table at this stage because you’ve got to make sure that you have all of the tools available if that is what’s necessary,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It urged governments to\u0026nbspstep in to support sectors most affected\u0026nbspsuch as travel and tourism, and the car and electronics industries.It also called for central banks to provide extra liquidity to banks so\u0026nbspthey can help businesses suffering immediate cashflow problems.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIf the epidemic spreads widely, the G20 economies should lead an internationally coordinated framework for health care support, combined with coordinated fiscal and monetary stimulus to rebuild confidence, the OECD’s report said.Amid trade tensions and political uncertainty, Europe and Japan were already growing slowly before the new coronavirus began to spread.The prospect of a pandemic sparked a\u0026nbsprapid sell-off on\u0026nbspstock markets around the globe last week as investors weighed up the impact of factory shutdowns, cancelled flights and disruption to the supply of goods.The FTSE 100\u0026nbspregained some of the lost ground on Monday morning, trading 1 per cent up on Friday’s close.\u0026nbspMarkets will gain little comfort from the OECD’s report or from separate data showing a slump in Chinese manufacturing.Factory activity plunged in February at its fastest rate and to its lowest level on record as anti-virus controls brought some production lines to a standstill.A monthly purchasing managers’ index released by Caixin magazine fell to 40.3 from January’s 51.1. A reading below 50 indicates output is shrinking.With many companies and countries reliant on imports of goods from China, the slowdown will begin to impact supplies globally in the coming weeks and months.Its central or “base” scenario is that global economic growth will be 2.4 per cent this year, down from the 2.9 per cent it had forecast as recently as November. However, it also warns that the economic impact from coronavirus remains very uncertain and growth could fall much further, to 1.5 per cent this year.Much of this downward revision results from a slowdown in China where factories and cities have been shut down to contain the virus. Countries strongly interconnected with China, such as Japan, Australia and South Korea, will also experience economic damage, the OECD says.The organisation\u0026nbspthinks the most likely scenario is that the effects of the virus will fade relatively soon. If the countries most exposed to coronavirus take effective\u0026nbspaction to mitigate the impact of coronavirus, global growth could rebound to 3.4 per cent next year.The OECD says: “A longer lasting and more intensive coronavirus outbreak, spreading widely throughout the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and North America, would weaken prospects considerably.”In this scenario, economies in Europe and North America will also experience significant economic fallout from the virus.Demand is likely to be significantly hit across much of the world for an extended period, with countries accounting for 70 per cent of global GDP likely to be affected.Other countries may not fully replicate\u0026nbspChina’s tough restrictions on movement, but\u0026nbspmany of the economic impacts are likely to be similar.\u0026nbspThis would\u0026nbspsignificantly damage\u0026nbspconfidence, causing heightened uncertainty, while\u0026nbspvoluntary\u0026nbsprestraints on travel and commercial and sporting events are all likely to depress spending.On Sunday, the UK health secretary Matt Hancock refused to rule out shutting down cities if the virus spreads widely in the country.\u0026nbspMr Hancock\u0026nbspsaid he would not take anything “off the table at this stage” when asked about a\u0026nbspWuhan-style\u0026nbspquarantine\u0026nbspby BBC’s Andrew Marr.“There’s clearly a huge economic and social downside to that but we don’t take anything off the table at this stage because you’ve got to make sure that you have all of the tools available if that is what’s necessary,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As a result, the Appeal Board has found proven two further charges which were originally dismissed. Other factual findings of the Regulatory Commission were left undisturbed.“In relation to the sanction, the Appeal Board agreed with The FA that the penalty originally imposed on Mr Sturridge was unduly lenient and therefore increased his effective playing ban from two weeks to four months. The Appeal Board also doubled the fine to £150,000.“The written reasons in this matter are available below and provide considerable detail in relation to all the charges and the Appeal Board’s determinations of them. As will be clear, The FA takes any form of betting misconduct and the provision of inside information very seriously.\u0026nbsp“FIFA has confirmed that the suspension will be of worldwide effect.”Sturridge was released by Liverpool last summer after scoring 67 goals in 160 appearances during a six-year spell at the Premier League club. He began his career at Manchester City before joining Chelsea in 2009 and has also had loan spells at Bolton and West Brom.He also scored eight goals in 26 senior appearances for England after making his debut under Fabio Capello against Sweden in 2011.The latest football headlines direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

New York native Iliza Shlesinger brings a fresh take on topics from modern dating to wedding planning headaches. Her show is a delightful mix of reality checks and insightful takes.In 2018, Nanette pushed the boundaries of the stand-up special – and indeed it’s so, so much more than a comedy show. In a little more than an hour, Hannah Gadsby deconstructs the makings of a good joke, explains why she’s done with self-deprecation, and delivers an unforgettable, incredibly powerful take on the trauma she’s experienced as a lesbian in Tasmania.Standout line: “I have built a career out of self-deprecating humour and I don’t want to do that anymore. Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It’s not humility, it\u0027s humiliation. I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak, and I simply will not do that anymore. Not to myself or anybody who identifies with me.”If you liked Ali Wong in Always Be My Maybe (which she co-wrote!), then you’re going to love her in Hard Knock Wife (her second Netflix special and a follow-up on her 2016 debut Baby Cobra). Her unapologetic takes on motherhood and marriage (did you know she makes a lot more money than her husband and she’s not sorry?) are gold.Standout line: “Now, I make a lot more money than my husband by, like, a long shot. My mom is very concerned that he’s going to leave me out of intimidation. I had to explain to her that the only kind of man who would leave a woman who makes more money… is the kind of man that doesn’t like free money.”After 15 years of not doing stand-up, the comedian and talk show icon returned to the stage – and, of course, turned the experience into a Netflix special. Under the pretence of pondering whether she’s still relatable, Ellen DeGeneres basks in the (well-earned) glory her accomplishments, reflects on her personal experiences – including her 1997 coming-out and how it was received in Hollywood – and riffs on the absurdities of daily life. What a treat.510 Son of Patricia, Trevor NoahTrevor Noah has been starring in comedy specials for a decade, so it’s no surprise that he can take just about any topic (tourism in Bali, trap music, a conversation with President Barack Obama) and turn it into incisive jokes.Katherine Ryan’s second Netflix special (the follow-up to In Trouble, which came out in 2017) tackles some of her trademark topics, from dating to co-parenting, in a lighthearted, self-affirming way. A delight through and through.Back in 2012, Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, was appearing as the unforgettable Troy Barnes in Community – and spared a little time to record a Netflix special, which remains available to this day. Throughout this one-hour show, he shows off his range, reflecting on his music career, reaching his late twenties, and that brief time when the internet really wanted him to play Spider-Man.Standout line: “I lived in Downtown LA, and Downtown LA is kind of like the Eighties decided to stay there. They’re like, ‘Oh, OK, you guys go ahead and be the Nineties. Go enjoy Ace of Base – we’ll be here practicing the Moonwalk and selling crack.’”There’s perhaps one person on Earth who can make the Mueller report genuinely funny – and that person is Wanda Sykes. The comedian might be best known for her roles on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Black-ish, but her stand-up is well worth a watch. She has impeccable timing, sharp writing, and an apparently effortless ability to connect with her crowd.Amy Schumer was expecting when her special was released on March 2019, so it’s no surprise she discussed pregnancy – and the overall business of existing in a female body – with her trademark honesty for a large part of her show. This special is actually made up of two shows, Dark and Jigsaw. The Scottish comedian refreshes the “fish out of water” archetype by delivering his take on the US – and that time he told a joke about being an atheist in Indiana. His smart writing enables him to tackle topics, such as disability and – yes – paedophilia, in a way few comics could pull off.Standout line: “As a parent – no, I’m not a parent, but I like speaking for other people, because I’m white, middle-class and male, and that’s what my people do.”If you didn’t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again.

We will send the first woman and next man to the lunar South Pole by 2024, and we need more astronauts to follow suit on the Moon, and then Mars,” said NASA Administrator Jim\u0026nbspBridenstine\u0026nbspin a statement.“We’re looking for talented men and women from erse backgrounds and every walk of life to join us in this new era of human exploration that begins with the Artemis program to the Moon. If you have always dreamed of being an astronaut, apply now.”Nasa reveals ‘really exciting’ first findings from underneath MarsAny successful astronauts will be selected in 2021 and then begin training, a tough process that can take years.Last time around, in 2015, some 18,300 people applied and just 11 new astronauts made it through to last year\u0027s graduation.“Becoming an astronaut is no easy task, because being an astronaut is no easy task,” said Steve\u0026nbspKoerner, NASA’s director of flight operations and chair of the Astronaut Selection Board at NASA’s Johnson Space\u0026nbspCenter\u0026nbspin Houston.“Those who apply will likely be competing against thousands who have dreamed of and worked\u0026nbsptoward\u0026nbspgoing to space for as long as they can remember. But somewhere among those applicants are our next astronauts, and we look forward to meeting you.”The requirements for applicants\u0026nbspare strict: they must have a master\u0027s degree in a STEM field, or equivalent experience. They must also have two years of related professional experience or 1,000 hours of flying a jet aircraft.To get through the selection programme, they will also have to pass a physical exam. For the first time, some of the assessment will take place online, with a test that will take up to two hours to complete.Successful astronauts could be deployed to a wide variety of different missions. After training they could head to the International Space Station to take part in experiments, but may also be selected as part of the plans to head back to the Moon and then use that as a step to head to Mars in the mid-2030s.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Brexit may be set to cost the UK more than £200 billion in lost economic growth by the end of this year but we will once again be able to travel with a blue passport. Result!”There were also those who felt compelled to point out the UK could have had blue passports at any point in the last 30 years, and that Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government had switched the colour to burgundy under no duress from the EU.“I want my classic Thatcher-approved burgundy passport back!

Made entirely from recycled materials, it was unveiled ahead of its debut at the Celtic Connections Costal Day celebrations in Glasgow this weekendYouGov polling conducted for the Greater London Assembly in 2018 suggested more than two-thirds of Londoners favour caps on the amount landlords can charge.At the launch of his re-election campaign at a housing estate in Hackney on Tuesday, Mr Khan was expected to say: “The case for rent controls is now absolutely undeniable. But Tory ministers have blocked us from introducing our plans for rent controls in London - and have simply said no. They have refused to give us the powers we need to make rent controls happen.The government needs to start a rental revolution“That’s why today, I am making the mayoral election on 7 May a referendum on rent controls – showing Londoners that I will stand up for renters.“Because if Londoners re-elect me as their mayor on 7 May, I want no-one to have any doubt that it represents an undeniable and irresistible mandate for the introduction of rent controls in our city. The prime minister will have to give us the powers we need.“If he refuses to do so, he will be denying the express democratic will of millions of Londoners who are crying out for rent controls. And as we have all heard Boris Johnson repeatedly say himself, the democratic will of the people must be respected and it is not for politicians to frustrate it.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailA report commissioned by the mayor last year set out how London could take on powers to bring rents down and create open-ended tenancies without undermining the rental market, in a similar way to cities around the world including Berlin and New York.Details of his proposals have not yet been released, but it is understood the mayor would establish a new London Private Rent Commission, with renters on its board, to implement and enforce measures to control prices.Dr Kristian Niemietz, head of political economy at the free-market thinktank the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: “Rent controls have never worked anywhere. They do not just fail to solve the problem they are intended to solve they also create new ones of their own.“If Sadiq Khan had any interest in solving London’s housing crisis, he would focus on the supply side. He could, for example, push for a review of Green Belt boundaries, and a relaxation of height and density restrictions.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But rural and coastal communities voted out in large numbers during the 2016 referendum after the Vote Leave campaign argued that farmers and fishermen would be better off once free of EU rules.The government distanced itself from the official’s comments, adding: “We have made it clear the comments are not in line with government policy.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A home flooded after the River Aire burst its banks in East Cowick, East Yorkshire Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg takes part in a Youth Strike 4 Climate protest march in Bristol, south west England.

So absolutely\u0026nbspwe need our famers, and of course we are the bedrock of the largest manufacturing sector providing all those raw ingredients.\u0026nbsp“Clearly, there is a cold economic case. But you have to look at the wider aspect of all of this: farms are the backbone of rural Britain. Surely the last thing we want to go to is importing cheaper, raw ingredients produced to lower standards. We export our conscience and our production.”\u0026nbspLast week, the environment secretary George Eustice came in for criticism after he refused to rule out chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef being imported from the US as part of a trade agreement with Washington.Fishermen also fear promises made to them about\u0026nbspincreased catch quotas and controlling who fishes in British waters could be traded in exchange for market access during the talks with the EU, which are due to begin next week.Brussels has made clear it wants little to change in terms of access for European boats and quota allocation once the transition period is over in December.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And so we must recognise that at this point in the race, the best way to keep faith with those goals and ideals is to step aside and help bring our party and our nation together, he said. So tonight I am making the difficult decision to suspend my campaign for the presidency.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Democratic candidates compete on the campaign trail: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jessica Canicosa, a precinct captain for Bernie Sanders, waits to greet caucus voters at Liberty High School in Henderson, NevadaA supporter of Amy Klobuchar in Las Vegas, NevadaHotel workers at the Bellagio in Las Vegas get to grips with voting papers during the Nevada caucusesMichael J Fox –\u0026nbspthe Back to the Future actor turned activist –\u0026nbspspeaks at a rally for Pete Buttigieg at Faiss Middle School in Las VegasVoters at a campaign event for Amy Klobuchar in Reno, NevadaA caricature of Bernie Sanders is projected on to a tree during a rally in Las VegasA woman waits to have a photo taken with Elizabeth Warren during a town hall meeting in Las VegasThe threat of coronavirus and other germ-borne illnesses was on some voters\u0027 minds at the Democratic caucuses in Henderson, NevadaFormer vice-president Joe Biden takes a selfie with a voter in Las Vegas ahead of the Nevada caucusesA member of Mike Bloomberg\u0027s election team in a campaign office in New York CityAmy Klobuchar changes her shoes backstage after giving a speech in Exeter, New HampshireA warmly-wrapped-up dog attends an Elizabeth Warren event at Amherst Elementary School in Nashua, New HampshireBernie Sanders, who romped to victory in New Hampshire against Hillary Clinton in 2016, talks to the media in ManchesterLisa Olney, of Wellesley, Massachussets, demonstrates her support for Elizabeth Warren in Nashua, New HampshireJoe Biden was hoping to improve on his poor showing in Iowa in the New Hampshire primaryElizabeth Warren, renowned for giving time to supporters for selfies, works the crowd at the University of New Hampshire in DurhamJoe Biden takes a selfie with a supporter and his child outside a campaign event in Somersworth, New Hampshire on 5 FebruaryElizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders quarrel after a confrontation in a TV debate in which Sanders claimed that Warren was not telling the truth about a conversation in which she claimed he had said a woman could not win the presidency on 14 JanuarySupporter Pat Provencher listens to Pete Buttigieg in Laconia, New Hampshire on 4 FebruaryElizabeth Warren jogs away after speaking to reporters during a campaign event in Nashau, New HampshireSupporters of Amy Klobuchar gather before a rally.

His campaign then quietly announced a detour to Indiana, where he confirmed his decision to step aside.In a statement earlier to The Independent, the campaign said that Mr Buttigieg believes this is the right thing to do for our country, for our party and for Americans across the country eager to heal our ided nation, defeat this president and work to fix our broken politics.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This year, 14 states will vote on Super Tuesday, including the nation’s most populous states, California and Texas.\u0026nbspOf crucial importance, we will see the impact of former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg’s non-traditional, self-funded run, that has seen him invest up to $400m to win support in many of the states voting on Super Tuesday.In order to win any delegates (a candidate needs to amass 1,991 delegates to achieve the party’s nomination) candidates have to win at least 15 percent of the vote in the state.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThere are enough delegates at stake that a strong showing for senator Bernie Sanders could cement his spot as Democratic nominee. At the same time, should he fail to overcome his top rivals, the race could become a serious competition between two or potentially even three candidates.\u0026nbspHere’s a state-by-state breakdown to keep you informed heading into Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspAll demographic numbers are from the Centre for American Progress’ “States of Change” report.\u0026nbspThe Yellowhammer state has 61 total delegates – including 9 superdelegates – up for grabs on Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspDemographically, Alabama is one of six states – along with the District of Columbia – where black Democratic voters are the majority. Democratic voter composition in Alabama in 2016 was 71 per cent black, 26 per cent white and three per cent other races.\u0026nbspAccording to 2016 Census data, Alabama has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals 65 years of age and older – almost 20 per cent versus the 19 percent average. The state’s median household income is more than $10,000 less than the national average, $42,830 versus $53,657 nationally. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFiveThirtyEight predicts former Vice President Joe Biden will take the state, giving him a 61 percent chance at victory in the state. Mr Sanders is the next most likely to take the state with a 21 percent chance of victory, and Mr\u0026nbspBloomberg is in third with a 17 percent chance of victory.There are 31 pledged delegates available to win in Arkansas including five superdelegates. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDemographically, Arkansas’ Democratic voters are 69 per cent white, 36 per cent black, three per cent Hiic and two per cent other races.According to 2016 Census data, the state has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals over the age of 65 – 21 per cent versus the national average of 19 per cent – and a median household income of $41,262 more than $10,000 less than the national average of $53,657.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Biden has a 25 per cent chance to win. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe most recent poll examining the Arkansas electorate from Talk Business \u0026amp PoliticsHendrix College Poll reported that Mr Bloomberg had a 3.2 percent lead over Mr Sanders in the state.\u0026nbspJust under 20 per cent of respondents said they’d vote for Mr Bloomberg, while 16.4 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Sanders and 18.5 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Biden.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThis is a massive prize. California, the country’s most populous state, has 415 pledged delegates and 79 superdelegates up for grabs.California’s Democratic voters are 50 per cent white, 26 per cent Hiic, 15 per cent Asian, eight per cent black and one percent other races.\u0026nbspCensus information from 2016 shows that 17 percent of the state is over the age of 65, just under the national average of 19 percent. The state’s median household income is $61,933, which is $2,276 higher than the national average. Despite this, the state’s poverty rate, 14.5 per cent, is slightly higher than the national average of 13.6 per cent.\u0026nbspMr Sanders is overwhelmingly favoured in polling to win California. FiveThirtyEight gives Mr Sanders an 89 per cent chance to win, with poll averages predicting Mr Sanders will win between 24 per cent and 43 per cent of the vote and win an average of the state’s 227 pledged delegates. Every other candidate is at risk of falling under the 15 per cent viability threshold. The closest runner up, Mr Biden, is only expected to win an average of 17 percent of the vote and an average of 83 delegates. Mr Sanders and Mr Biden are the only candidates whose predicted averages exceed the 15 percent viability threshold.\u0026nbspThe Centennial State has 67 pledged delegates on the line and nine superdelegates.Colorado’s Democratic voters are 75 per cent white, 15 per cent Hiic, six per cent black, and four per cent Asian and other races.Census data from 2016 shows that the state has a population of iniduals 65-year-old and over that is 2.4 percent lower than the national average of 18.9 per cent.

Ms Warren – who is the state’s senator – has a 25 per cent chance to win. The next closest candidate is Mr Biden with an eight per cent chance of victory. Mr Sanders is predicted to win an average of 35 delegates from the state.\u0026nbspMinnesota – Senator Amy Klobuchar’s home state – has 75 pledged delegates, including 10 superdelegates.

In an updated exit poll,\u0026nbspIsrael\u0027s Channel 13 dropped the figure to 59.\u0026nbspDuring an acrimonious campaign which focused more on character than on policy, right-wing and religious parties had pledged to join a Likud-led coalition government. But if the 60-seat projection held true, after actual results later on Tuesday, Mr Netanyahu would still have to enlist other allies in coalition negotiations.\u0026nbspA Likud spokesman said the prime minister would deliver a late-night victory speech at the party\u0027s election headquarters in Tel Aviv.\u0026nbspAhead of the address in an apparent declaration of victory, Mr Netanyahu wrote on Twitter: We won thanks to our belief in our path and thanks to the people of\u0026nbspIsrael.Exit polls put Netanyahu aheadBenjamin Netanyahu has held a solid edge over his main rival, exit polls indicated Monday night, but it is unclear whether he can clinch the parliamentary majority needed to claim victory.Exit polls on\u0026nbspIsrael\u0027s main TV channels showed Mr\u0026nbspNetanyahu and his nationalist and religious allies winning 60 seats, one short of a parliamentary majority. The center-left bloc, led by former military chief Benny Gantz, was projected to win 52 to 54 seats.\u0027This is one for the most intriguing, most interesting, and most gripping exit polls\u0027Camil Fuchs, a Tel Aviv University statistician conducting an exit poll for Channel 13 TV, indicated that the results could be dramatic.\u0026nbspFrom the data we have so far .. this is one for the most intriguing, most interesting, and most gripping exit polls - one of the most gripping there have been, he said on Channel 13.Trump has plenty at stake when Israelis vote again on new Netanyahu term - John T BennettThere is plenty on the line for Benjamin Netanyahu\u0026nbsptoday - John T Bennett writes -\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspbut\u0026nbspDonald Trump\u0026nbspalso has a stake in the outcome.He adds:\u0026nbspThe US president and the Israeli leader did little last month to hide their mutual affection as they strode side-by-side into the East Room at the\u0026nbspWhite House\u0026nbspto roll out Mr Trump\u0027s long-anticipated Israeli-Palestinian\u0026nbsppeace plan. The politically adept Mr Netanyahu sent a signal to voters back home about his relationship with Mr Trump, a country on which his depends for military equipment and defence dollars.~\u0026nbspPresident Trump, Donald, I\u0027m honoured to be here today, Mr Netanyahu said, daring to do something every other world leader avoids while standing in the White House: Calling the ego-driven American president by his first name. Even Trump himself typically refers to himself as Trump when speaking publicly in the third person.\u0027I think the fact we’ve had 3 elections in a year only says good things\u0027Yasmin Farhadian, 31, a doctor in Tel Aviv told The Independent she is voting Likud as Netanyahu is the “best prime minister Israel has ever had”.She dismissed the corruption trials against Netanyahu, saying that rather than it being a sign of a problem in Israel it showed how strong the country’s democracy is.\u0026nbspIsraeli voters furious at endless electionsAcross Israel,\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspsense of desperation appears to have\u0026nbspto driven voters to the polling booths,\u0026nbspour middle east correspondent,\u0026nbspBel Trew\u0026nbspwrites.\u0026nbspBut the enthusiasm to vote did not mask the anger.For them, it’s a shameful game of musical seats in parliament.

Yes, there have been more than , confirmed cases of coronavirus in more than  countries around the world.But in the UK, where more than , people have been tested, there have been  confirmed cases.To date, there have been no deaths in the UK from coronavirus and only one Brit — an elderly cruise ship passenger in Japan — has died in total.So when Covid- is routinely referred to as the “killer virus”, that is something less than the whole truth. Because most people unfortunate enough to catch it recover.Even in China, where there have been over , cases, the ­numbers of ­infection are slowing.Containing the virus works. As we edge closer to a full-blown pandemic, a little perspective will go a long way.As those Brit tourists locked inside the Costa Adeje Palace in Tenere would probably tell you, the greatest threat posed by the virus is massive inconvenience, not sudden death.If you are not old, and have no pre- existing medical conditions, then coronavirus is slightly more le-threatening than regular flu — which killed , Brits last year.Every doctor will tell you that hands are a route of transmission — so keep them clean, and take a rain-check on handshakes, manly hugs and social kissing.Professor Hugh Pennington, a ­lecturer in diseases at Aberdeen University, says, “Just using ordinary soap and water is all that’s needed.It can make all the dference and really limit the spread of this virus.”We should be thinking about ­better personal hygiene rather than panic buying.I am not making the case for complacency. The world is facing the greatest health crisis for a ­generation.This week the first cases were seen in countries as far apart as Pakistan, Greece, Brazil, Nigeria and Wales.The cancelled sporting events are piling up. Schools are closing. The stock market is in freefall. This is not normal le.Personally, I am not getting on a plane until my daughter is the far side of her exams in the spring.My local gym has installed hand sanitisers and I use them.When I see someone coughing, I wish they had the common decency to cover their cakehole.But every one of us must walk the hard path between staying safe and staying sane.The Government’s worst-case scenario predicts half-a-million British deaths from the virus — which would exceed the number of British military and civilian deaths in World War Two.Is Covid- REALLY deadlier than living through — and fighting in — World War Two The Government should ditch the scare stories and tell us how to stay healthy. They should keep repeating how simple personal hygiene habits can contain the spread of Covid-.Keep calm, carry on and wash your hands.For as any doctor will tell you, there is nothing more contagious than panic.ANA De Armas is doing the heavy lting in promoting the new Bond film, No Time To Die.In the last week alone, Ana has appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair and Porter magazines. What’s lovely about the Cuban goddess is that she actually seems happy to be in a James Bond movie.“I was jumping all over the place and very excited,” she says about getting her role as CIA agent Paloma.In stark contrast, it is hard to imagine grumpy old Daniel Craig jumping with excitement at anything to do with the Bond franchise.“I don’t even call them Bond girls,” grumbles downbeat Dan.It’s like having Victor Meldew playing .DAVID Dimbleby, the nearest thing the BBC has to royalty, claims that: “The whole idea of a national broadcaster that speaks truth to the nation and is impartial and objective is under threat.”But whose fault is that Millions of us blame the BBC. Because during the great national debate about Brexit, the BBC was openly, unapologetically biased.The orthodoxy of BBC opinion is totally out of touch with the people who fork out the £billion a year for the licence fee.For years the BBC told those people that they are thick, ignorant racists who would all soon be dead.If the BBC had been “impartial and objective” in recent years, it would not be ripe for losing the licence fee.Prince Harry and the Queen have always seemed close.And in a family that is not big on displays of affection, the Queen’s face always seemed to light up in her grandson’s cheeky, ginger-bonce presence.But his North American exile means Harry will now see far less of his grandmother,  this April.If Harry has an IQ bigger than Meghan’s shoe size, I bet he will live to regret it.STORM Dennis, Storm Ciara and now Storm Jorge.For three weeks in a row, rain and floods have brought abject misery across the country from the north of England to Wales – the same areas that gave Boris Johnson his -seat majority.Homes have been ruined.

What is he afraid of That someone will shout at him  You really need to man up, put on your wellies and get out there, Boris.Because right now it looks like you don’t give a toss.PROMOTER Frank Warren is right – a fight between Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua would be the biggest British sporting event since the  World Cup Final.ButJoshua fights someone  next – Kubrat Pulev is currently booked for June – then anything could happen, just as it did in AJ’s first clash with Bart Simpson’s stunt double, Andy Ruiz.Fury and Joshua should do it at Wembley, do it next and claim their place in history.If Tyson does not take on AJ next, then they may never fight at all.WHITNEY Houston, who died in  at the tragically young age of , is on tour as a hologram.Apparently, the Whitney hologram is convincing, especiallyyou don’t sit too close.

Others are on borrowed time.Casualties could yet include the biggest fish of all, Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill — Rutnam’s predecessor at the Home Office.If he survives, it will be at the cost of his second huge job as head of national security.Few of these shadowy Whitehall aristocrats will welcome Sir Calamity’s decision to wash their dirty linen in public.And with a career-long ­catalogue of costly blunders to his name, drama queen ­Rutnam could yet regret suing for unfair dismissal.Witnesses might testy to his “sneaky and snivelling” ­managerial style — including perhaps Amber Rudd, who blames him for destroying her career as a Cabinet high-flier.Rutnam left her to swing for his department’s unforgivable Windrush scandal and the deportation of innocent West Indian migrants.As Ms Rudd fell on her sword, Rutnam “went missing”.“She repeatedly asked for the information but it was never forthcoming,” says a friend.“Then a week after she resigned, the data was made available. The whole thing was very odd.”In other words, it stinks.Sir Philip had little time for Priti Patel.“He seemed to think Priti was stupid and treated her as such,” says an insider.Once exposed to daylight, such arrogance, coupled with third-party allegations of racism, can be politically explosive.We are witnessing a deceptively important battle on the home front, fought in parallel with Brexit.Downing Street believes it is winning the fight for ­sovereignty.

If lockdown was imposed for a month, this rises to £. billion.”This morning the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development slashed the  global growth forecast by .% over the outbreak.It came as:It comes as the new chancellor Rishi Sunak was warned his budget plans may be blown apart due to the coronavirus causing massive economic disruption.The government’s economic watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, is expected to revise its economic forecasts after stock markets plummeted all over the world.Economists say the global spread of the virus could even trigger a recession.Last week US oil company Chevron sent  staff home after an employee ed from an Italian skiing trip feeling unwell.Yesterday Matt Hancock refused to rule out coronavirus shutting down entire cities like they have done in China.The Health Secretary also admitted a vaccine to treat the deadly bug was months away and the Government would publish doomsday plans this week.The public are being pushed to make sure they clean their hands as thoroughly as possible to stop the spread of the killer coronavirus bug.The Health Secretary yesterday warned people should scrub their mitts for at least  seconds to destroy as many germs as possible.He told Radio  Live: You should do that for  seconds or more, and the way we explain it to children is that you should sing… wash your hands as long as you’re singing either Happy Birthday or God Save The Queen.This morning shadow Health Secretary Jonathon Ashworth said he would support shutting down cities to control the spread of coronavirus.Mr Ashworth said: If the medical advice and the scientic advice is to take measures along those lines, of course we would support them.If the medical advice is to do something like that then of course we should support it.Symptoms of Covid- can include:In most cases, you wont know whether you have a coronavirus or a dferent cold-causing virus.Buta coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract, it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or people with weakened immune systems.It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes.The best way to prevent catching any form of coronavirus is to practice good hygiene.If you have cold-like symptoms, you can help protect others by staying home when you are sick and avoiding contact with others.You should also cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze then throw it away and wash your hands.Cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces which you may have touched is also important.If you have ed from Wuhan in the last  days:If you are in Northern Ireland, call your GP.Please follow this advice evenyou do not have symptoms of the virus.Meanwhile, leading symptom-checking provider to the NHS Doctorlink has been updated to help identy patients risk of having coronavirus.Source: NHSExperts have warned that desperate moves to contain the Covid- outbreak could decimate all sport across the UK for months.Clubs have begun taking their own precautions to protect star players from infection.Tottenham’s injured South Korean ace Son Heung-min, , has been forced to self-isolate for two weeks after ing from his home country, where hundreds of cases have erupted.Rugby has already been hit by the postponement of next week’s Six Nations clash between Ireland and virus-plagued Italy.Englands football friendly against Italy at Wembley on Friday March  is still officially on — though it is subject to review.The Chinese Formula One Grand Prix scheduled for April  has been postponed, while other races are in doubt."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus extreme measures","story":"From travel bans and axing public events to forced quarantine and placing whole cities on lockdown, almost no aspect of modern le is untouched.Experts and politicians in Britain have warned the outbreak will only get worse and are drawing up a raft of plans to combat the Covid- disease.As the number of cases in the UK rose to , PM Boris Johnson said the outbreak is likely to become more signicant for this country in the next days and weeks.He said after chairing a crisis Cobra meeting: We have agreed a plan so that as and when,it starts to spread, as it looks likely it will, we are in a position to take the steps that will be necessary to contain the spread of the disease.So far most people in the UK have not seen any effect on their daily lives, unlike in other places around the world.China put more than  million citizens in effective quarantine in an effort to contain the virus in Hubei province where it started.And Italy - site of the worst outbreak in Europe - put  towns under lockdown with travel restrictions for  million people.A look at the ways the virus is being tackled around the world gives us a taste of what may be to come.France, which has  cases and two deaths so far, has closed the Louvre Museum and introduced a ban on all indoor gatherings of more than , people.Japan has banned horse racing fans from going to the track and the Tokyo Marathon was held yesterday with almost no spectators.There are fears this summers Olympics in the Japanese capital could be under threat.Here, Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty has said the UK will have to consider axing mass gatheringsthe virus intensies.An emergency shutdown could mean the Grand National, the FA Cup and this summers Euros football tournament face the axe along with Glastonbury Festival.Even the London Marathon next month could be called off as organisers say said they are monitoring the situation.Irelands Six Nations rugby clash against Italy has already been postponed because of the outbreak.Hong Kong closed schools form January to April in a bid to stop the virus spreading, and Japanese schools closed for two weeks.In Britain, some  schools have already shut after pupils, parents or teachers were feared to have the virus.There are fears thousands more schools could be forced to follow suit.Experts have already warned of the possible impact on GCSE and A level exams.Many countries including the US have banned visitors from countries with high rates of the virus.Some have also put limits on travel within countries and regions to slow the potential spread, such as in China and Italy.The UK government is wary of the huge shock to economy that would follow, but will have to consider similar measures in worst-case planning.Some airlines including BA have already axed routes to high risk destinations.Some shops in South Korea - site of the worlds second worst outbreak - demand all staff and shoppers wear masks.And in North Korea shop assistants take customers temperature before serving them.It is not as extreme as in China where millions are banned from shopping and robots take shoppers temperatures.One restaurant even erected plastic screens across tables to stop germs while people eat with their face masks removed.Health officials are screening passengers for symptoms at many international airports, including taking temperatures.With a bit of creativity, ingenious solutions include everything from robots delivering food to hotel guests, to using piping hot metal to avoid touching germ-covered surfaces.One genius shopkeeper in China used a slide and wireless payment system to sell buns without having to get close to shoppers.Elsewhere in China an amateur marathon runners determination to keep fit while in quarantine saw him run repeatedly run around two tables and using the shortof his hall and balcony.Robots have also been used to serve food to what are believed to be quarantined guests at a hotel in East China.Another brave woman was spotted visiting her local supermarket wearing what appears to be a bizarre-looking plastic tube.One man was able to ski on the roof of a building in order to keep busy while being held up inside his home.And another Chinese woman used a remote-controlled car to collect food so she wouldnt need to leave her home.South Korea, battling more than , cases, has set up stations to test drivers in their cars.Similar pilot schemes have begun in London and Edinburgh, with the idea of keeping potentially infected patients out of waiting rooms.It could be extended nationwide as the outbreak grows.China and South Korea have been spraying streets with chemicals meant to kill viruses.Foot soldiers, tanks, drones and wheeled robots have all been deployed to sterilise public spaces, although it is not clear how effective it is.Some blocks of flats in China even make residents walk through a tunnel of anti-viral spray before entering their homes.In China there have been reports of police snatching people off the streets and locking them up in isolation camps.That may sounds draconian, but emergency measures being introduced here could have similar effect.The issue was raised when a Brit evacuated from China asked what would happenhe walked out of the Wirral hospital where he was quarantined for  days.The Government said it had the power to hold people against their will to stop the virus spreading.Health Secretary Matt Hancock repeated yesterday that authorities were already were able to forcibly quarantine members of the populationthey were at risk.Ministers are drawing up a battle plan with emergency legislation to suspend a raft of laws from health and safety to school and nursery class sizes.In China, Wuhan and other cities in Hubei are under quarantine with factories and offices shut and residents ordered to stay indoors.Only one member of each household is allowed out once every three days to buy food.Many people cannot buy food at all and have groceries delivered to their gates by special committees.Italy sealed off  towns in Lombardy and Veneto after a cluster of cases erupted near Milan.Police manned road blocks to ensure no one entered or left a km red zone without permission.Ministers here are considering similar moves as a last resort.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said yesterday: We dont take anything off the table, because you’ve got to make sure that you have all the tools available,that is what’s necessary.But I want to minimise the social and economic disruption.Branches of Boots, Superdrug and Waitrose have sold out of sanitising hand gel.Supermarkets shelves have been stripped bare in Italy, Romania and now New York after the first case was confirmed there on Sunday.Panic buying in Britain could cause supply problems, prompting more people to rush to stock up.In a worst-case scenario -

As is pretty much everyone  on The Split.The only other ones you really need bother about, though, are the firm’s dandyish boss Zander, whose spirit animal is Rupert The Bear.His partner, Tyler, who “specialises in mergers”, which I think is meant to sound sexy.And Hannah’s unfaithful husband Nathan, played by Stephen Mangan, who’s thinking of getting it on with an office junior called Chloe who is not just the authentic voice of The Split but the entire BBC.“I heard you speak at the Women In Law lunch,” she says, less than enticingly, at one point.“Feminist perspectives on cross-examination. It was great.”Yeah, it sounds like a total riot.You feel for the actors, obviously. They’re constrained not just by the script and the EastEnders rules of drama, but by the subject matter as well.In Walford, they at least have a small choice of storylines.Here, there’s just one. Divorce, orce and more orce.A slightly more savvy drama department would’ve given up on it after one series.The Beeb just ploughs on, though, trying to jolly it along with some insanely annoying incidental music and a couple of guest stars.This series, they’ve gone for broke and landed Donna Air off Byker Grove, who spends the duration of her screen time, as TV presenter Fi Hansen, looking like she’s got a particularly bad smell under her nose.She thinks its disdain for her controlling screen husband, Richie.We all know it looks more like contempt for the show, the plot and the script, which forces poor Nicola Walker to scream: “You have s**t, Nina.We all have s**t.” And there’s another two weeks of this s**t to go.Avoid avoid avoid.MEANWHILE, on Liar, Laura Nielson: “I don’t know how Andrew Earlham died and I don’t care.”Snap.SHE’S McDonald, he’s Dodds.

The damn thing comes and goes, like the ad breaks, so it’s really hard to tell.Bog-standard Sunday night brain rot, so far.The real trouble here, though, is that as well as a lousy script and bonkers plot, McDonald  Dodds writer Robert Murphy has got a very PC political axe, which he grinds against multi-millionaire entrepreneur Max Crockett , who bears no physical resemblance to the Prime Minister.However, he has got a surprisingly large number of children, a much younger pregnant we and a way of quivering with rage about “the politics of envy” that leaves you in no doubt where all of Murphy’s prejudices lie.The normal rules of quality drama and all the most self-important catch-up viewers dictate that spoilers are absolutely forbidden on a whodunnit.So I’ve got no hesitation telling you it was Kasha, the lesbian, traveller waitress, who shot Max’s secret son, Seth.Begone, McDonald  Dodds.

The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. The services the NHS provides will not be on the table. The NHS is not, and never will be, for sale to the private sector, whether overseas or domestic.”The language on food standards such as GM food, chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef was left much more ambiguous.It said: “Any agreement will ensure high standards and protections for consumers and workers, and will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards.”Lting the GM ban paves the way for cheaper food on supermarket shelves.But it risks infuriating British farmers, who face being flooded with cheap American produce.Official trade talks with the US are expected to start in the middle of March.David Lawrence, senior political adviser at the Trade Justice Movement, warned: “The Government continues to deliberately miss the point on food standards, including chlorinated chicken, GM crops and hormone-fed beef.“While they repeatedly say that the UK won’t lower its own farming regulations, they have not ruled out importing food from the US that is made to these lower standards.“The fact is that some US farming practices are illegal in the UK, for health, environmental and animal welfare reasons, and there is no doubt that the government will be under immense pressure to allow these products into the UKit wants a trade deal with the US.”Today Ms Truss will become the first British minister to speak to the World Trade Organisation since the UK became a member in its own right following Brexit.Last night the US Trade Secretary Robert Lighthizer urged the UK to ditch its opposition to chlorinated chicken - a potential stumbling block to the talks.In a speech to the Oxford Union, he said: “I’ve had a lot of meals in America with a lot of European trade negotiators, and they’ve never been hesitant in ordering the chicken.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The annual statement on your pay, pensions, taxes and more was derailed when Sajid Javid quit as Chancellor in a political row with  Downing Street. But novice Chancellor Rishi Sunak decided to press on with the date of March . Now, however, the usual focus of the statement could be knocked off course by the onset of Coronavirus in the UK. No insiders insist the Budget will not downgrade spending plans, despite the COVID- virus sending stock markets plummeting. But it will have extra measures to deal with the virus. Meanwhile the age-old contentious funding issues of social care, benefits poverty and cash-strapped schools are likely to bubble along without the usual scrutiny. So what is the Budget, why is it so important and what might it mean for your money  All the latest predictions and information are below.What is the Budget  A statement made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on his plans for tax, public spending and economic forecasts. It sets key duties on fuel, cigarettes and alcohol as well as the minimum wage. MPs vote on whether to accept it. In past times this would be a controversial vote, but Boris Johnson has a majority of  so itaposs almost guaranteed to pass. When is the Budget   The Budget is at .pm in the House of Commons on Wednesday  March. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs speech is expected to take about an hour, packed full of massively important announcements and more than a little political point-scoring. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will then respond to the Budget. It is the first Budget since October . There have been a spring statement and a aposspending roundapos since then, but these are less far-reaching than the Budget. Budget  confirmed policies  Minimum wageThe minimum wage for over-s will rise by p to £. an hour from April. It will also rise to £. , £. , £.and £. . Normally the Budget might be the first time we find out about these rises, but this yearaposs is being held unusually close to April  so itaposs already been announced. Inheritance Tax The Tories have repeatedly cut Inheritance Tax, to the point you can now leave £, to your relatives tax-free . From April  that is due to hit £,, making the tax-free sum for married couples a cool £million. National Insurance From April, you will pay no national insurance contributions on the first £, of your earnings - up from £, at the moment - working out as a saving of around £ a year. The move has been criticised for falling short of the £-a-year Boris Johnson promised, and only helping better earners who are already over the threshold. Budget  predictions Coronavirus Coronavirus will, without doubt, affect the Budget. The biggest impact may not be dealing with the outbreak itself. Instead it could be the nosee the virus has prompted on global markets - which constrains how much ministers have to spend. A Treasury spokesman said: The potential implications of COVID- for the UK economy and the economic response will, of course, be the context in which next week’s Budget is delivered. The Chancellor will provide a further update on economic developments and Government action to the House. Sources say that may involve pulling levers to change rules on sick pay, which MPs warn does not cover low-wage workers who are forced into self-isolation. Fuel duty  Fuel duty has been kept at .p per litre for petrol and diesel since . Last yearaposs freeze alone will cost the Treasury more than £billion over five years. Rumours have abounded that, finally, the rate will be raised. But that would likely prompt a Tory revolt. More than a dozen newly-elected aposblue-collarapos MPs warned clobbering working-class car drivers will send the wrong message about this Government’s priorities. Entrepreneursapos relief  The Tory manesto vowed to review and reform entrepreneursapos relief - a £bn tax break that reduces Capital Gains Tax for people selling their business. But business lobby groups were angry at rumours the relief could be scrapped altogether. The Federation of Small Businesses said it would destroy the retirements of thousands of business owners.Labour on the other hand backed ending the relief, saying: We said we would scrap the relief but turn it into a grant because then you would then get the productivity gains that everyone needs. Northern infrastructure  Boris Johnson won a sweep of aposred wallapos northern and Midlands seats in the general election. He has repeatedly promised to repay votersapos trust with a string of big infrastructure projects. Expect the Budget to make a big political play of help to these areas, despite the headwinds of Coronavirus. But the devil will be in the detail. Will the Chancellor announce hard cash or will he merely announce aposreviewsapos and consultations with the promise of jam tomorrow  Cigarettes and alcohol  Itaposs common for the Budget to put another penny or two on sin taxes - including cigarettes and alcohol. Final rates are confirmed on Budget Day and usually apply from that evening - prompting some to make a quick rush to the shops. Income Tax The Budget is the traditional time to make changes to Income Tax. In Labouraposs day this revolved around introducing new rates for higher earners.

Tory minister Baroness Stedman-Scott admitted the six-in-one benefit has contributed to the soaring numbers of people turning to charities for help. The peer, who worked for  years at a youth unemployment charity, stressed the benefit was not everything and people were not sanctioned without reason.She told the House of Lords: Iaposve got no doubt, and Iaposve agreed with this before, that Universal Credit has contributed to the increased use in food banks. But itaposs not everything.However, I would say to you that claimants will only ever be sanctioned where without good reason theyaposve failed to meet the reasonable requirements agreed in their claimant commitment. The comments come a year since then-Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd admitted a link between food banks and Universal Credit for the first time.The Mirror understands Ms Ruddaposs comments - which came after years of Tory denials - led at the time to a dressing-down from then-Prime Minister Theresa May .Ms Rudd stressed she had only been talking about the early roll-out of the benefit, before the six-week wait for payment was reduced to five. Charities say the five-week wait is still too long and forces claimants to take out advances which are then repaid from their future benefits. Baroness Stedman-Scott, a former chief executive of Tomorrowaposs People, made the comments in response to crossbench peer Baroness Boycott.

They spent the freezing night floating along on fragments of the roof. Not all of them survived. Mina Kooijman, who was  at the time of the ordeal in , said she watched the sea water in their village in the Netherlands rush towards them “like a grey monster”. Around , of her compatriots were killed. It kick-started huge investment in flood defences, and no one has been killed by floods since then. Experts now say Britain needs to follow the Dutch example. The catastrophic storm in the North Sea in  killed more than  people in the UK and caused the MV Princess Victoria to sink off the coast, taking the lives of  more.At .pm on January , a telegram warning of “extremely dangerous high water” was issued by the Dutch Met Office .But few organisations subscribed to the telegram service in the low-lying nation and hardly anyone in the worst-hit areas was warned. The force of the waves burst the nation’s dykes and in a few hours water filled homes in the Zeeland province to the second floor. Mina’s family in the farming community of Nieuwerkerk, south west of Rotterdam, made their way into the attic then out on to the roof of their barn as the water rose. She later recalled: “We saw my gran, Uncle Pau and housekeeper [floating] by on a raft. A little later they disappeared into the water.  “Then the barn roof broke into pieces. My father and brother Han were on a separate piece of roof. “My mother, brother Wim, sister Hanna and I were on another.” After hours bobbing along in the wind and rain, the family reached a dyke and found refuge in a small house that had taken in  others who were suddenly homeless.  But -year-old Han did not make it. When the high water peaked at am, many people were caught out while sleeping. The North Sea flood was the worst disaster in the Netherlands during the th century. As well as the death toll, , buildings were flooded. The damage ran into tens of billions of pounds in today’s money.  Within  days, the Dutch government created a commission to try to ensure the country was never devastated by floods again. Billions were spent on the Delta Works, the largest flood protection system in the world. As well as  storm barriers, work included strengthening dykes, widening rivers and a system of drainage ditches, canals, sandbanks and pumping stations.  The jewel in the crown is the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier, completed in , which is nearly six miles long. Flood prevention is a source of national pride, evident as Jeroen Kramer, from the Water Management Information Centre, shows me around what he called “the Netherlands’ front door”. The Maeslantkering, said to be the world’s largest robot, is the storm surge barrier protecting the port of Rotterdam and over a million people. Completed in , it consists of two metal arms the size of the Efel Tower.  They stay open to allow ships to pass, but are ready to close when the water rises by ft. Jeroen says when a nation suffers major floods people there ask: “What are the Dutch doing ” The Maeslantkering cost taxpayers €million. He said: “In the Netherlands, we regard water as a national problem and everybody expects to pay.” Environmental scientist Angela Terry thinks the UK must spend much more on defences.  She said: “Investment in world-leading flood schemes is a sense of national pride [with the Dutch] yet in England only % of national infrastructure spending goes on protection... “As the world warms due to carbon emissions, sea levels are rising due to... melting ice. “As an island nation we are vulnerable on our entire coast.”  Ria Geluk, who was six when the  disaster hit the Netherlands and who survived by getting on to the roof, led a grassroots movement to found the WatersnoodMuseum, in Ouwerkek which opened in  as a memorial to the catastrophe. Ria, , said: “In  I think the Netherlands had a preview of what the future could look like for many in a world of global heating. “It took the  disaster for real action to be taken here. Will you [in Britain] wait for another one ” Peter Glas, the scientist in charge of protecting the Netherlands against floods, last week warned Britain should prepare for seas and tidal rivers to rise by over ft in  years – nearly double the Met Office’s worst-case predictions. Such a rise could inundate towns along estuaries and wreck places miles inland on tidal rivers such as the Thames, Severn, Wye and Tyne.

Venables and Robert Thompson, both aged  at the time of the murder in , have never seen the inside of an adult jail for the two-year-oldaposs murder. One of them has been housed just  minutes away from Jamesapos devastated parents, Denise and Stuart Fergus, who are desperate for the pair to get aposproperapos sentences in prison. They hope that Jamesapos landmark birthday on March  will be one with a positive legacy as they continue their campaign, but are adamant celebration is the wrong word. Speaking on new podcast series, aposHelen Wood chats to...apos - a collaboration with the Manchester Evening News - Denise said: “There’s been no justice for James whatsoever.“Thereaposs only one thing that I asked for and that was for them to have a proper sentence in a prison. “I didnapost expect them to throw away the key - I knew one day they’d walk again, but at least I would have had some justice for Jamesthey’d have spent time in an adult prison.  “But they never have done, they were put in a children’s secure unit where they got the best of everything so thereaposs no justice there again. “In fact I feel that they’ve been rewarded for the crime that they have committed - not punished.” When James was abducted, tortured and killed in February  in Bootle, Merseyside, it sent shock waves across the nation which have never been forgotten. Venables and Thompson served eight years in children’s secure units - the former was sent to the Red Bank Home in Merseyside while the latter was housed in Barton Moss Secure Care Centre in Manchester.  After being freed in , they were given new identities at the age of . Years later, when Denise and her husband Stuart found out they had been housed in close proximity to their home in Liverpool - one just  minutes away - they were devastated. Denise said: “They may as well have put one each side of me, at least then I would have known where they were and I would have kept a closer eye on them.” The couple told Big Brother winner Ms Wood how over the years they would be approached on the street by complete strangers who claimed to have knowledge about Jamesapos killers lestyles at the childrenaposs units.Stuart said: “We could be out shopping one day and someone would come and speak to us and then walk away. “We’ve had people knock at the door, total strangers who say she [Denise] was not getting the correct justice.” While Thompson has kept a low profile, Venables - whose identity has been leaked online - was sent to prison in  and  over possession of child abuse imagery. This prompted Denise to  petition the government  to conduct a public inquiry into her sonaposs case, which she believes raised a aposnumber of issues that have been swept under the carpetapos.In the petition, which received more than , signatures, Denise questioned why experts deemed Venables to be rehabilitated, and called for the report of the prison service into an aposincidentapos at Red Bank secure unit to be published. The government responded: The offender was convicted of further offences as a direct result of robust and effective monitoring. Therefore the Government considers that a public inquiry into this tragic case is not necessary. The frustrated mum - who also has thee other sons, Thomas, Leon and Michael - believes that Venables should be held to account for his identity being leaked online, believing itaposs aposhis faultapos.  She continued: “He’s untouchable, that’s the way it feels. All the money that’s spent on him to hide his identity, hundreds of thousands have been spent on him.” Stuart agreed, adding: “He’s laughed in the face of the government. Despite the horror of that day, Denise has always remained calm and composed and has dedicated her le to getting justice for her son. But for her family, itaposs a fight that is yet to be won. Speaking to Big Brother winner Helen Wood on the podcast, which is a collaboration with the Manchester Evening News, Denise said: “There’s been no justice for James whatsoever.  “Thereaposs only one thing that I asked for and that was for them to have a proper sentence in a prison. “I didnapost expect them to throw away the key - I knew one day they’d walk again, but at least I would have had some justice for Jamesthey’d have spent time in an adult prison. “But they never have done, they were put in a children’s secure unit where they got the best of everything so thereaposs no justice there again. “In fact I feel that they’ve been rewarded for the crime that they have committed - not punished.” Since his death, Denise and her family have worked tirelessly to help other families in James’ name through the work of the James Bulger Memorial Trust. The charity supports young people who are disadvantaged through bereavement,crime, hatred or bullying, by providing family holidays. They have events throughout the year to fund raise for the charity, and the next one will be their biggest yet. This year’s Black Tie and Tiara Ball, Saturday, March , will celebrate a milestone that James sadly never reached.

The actor had been filming in troubled Haiti when she and her camera crew were stopped in their car. Joanna, , said: “Suddenly there was a blockage across the road. They’d put branches down. Our bodyguards got out and said, ‘Come on guys, clear it away’. “And they said, ‘No, we want your money or your le.’ Sometimes they dig trenches, pour oil in and set fire to it, then they come with guns and take your wallets.” The gang let them pass unscathed. Joanna had been in the capital Port-au-Prince, which she described as a “catastrophe”. She added: “We arrived on the day of a riot, so we had a police escort to the hotel. Riots break out like wildfires across the land andyou’re in that place, you’re stuck.” But Joanna’s ordeal did not leave her feeling desperate to leave the Caribbean country. The presenter, who has made travel documentaries for more than a decade, said: “I’m not really an afraid kind of person. If you look timid, people and animals pick it up very fast. In Haiti, people are so poor, butyou say, ‘Bonjour,’ and put your hand out, you’ve made friends ­immediately.”  Haiti has been blighted by ­crippling debt, corrupt regimes and natural disasters, including the  earthquake. Joanna was horried to see children living in poverty “like wild animals”. She added: “The country’s broken, nothing works. There are unbelievably poor communities. “There were street children sleeping rough, abandoned by their families. But they dreamed of being pilots and lawyers, even though they’ve got no education. That affects you terribly.  “Seeing people living in squalor because they’ve been let down by the government is unbearable. You want to go to the top and say, ‘You b*ds, the first thing you can do is get clean water. Care for your people.’” But Joanna, who is married to conductor Stephen Barlow, said she still loves making travel shows, despite the horrors she witnesses.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailMPs really do down more booze than the average Brit, new research shows. Those who carry out extra work outside the Commons are the worst culprits - putting them among the country’s heaviest boozers. They are almost three times more prone to “risky drinking”, UK medical experts have warned. Parliamentarians are more likely to indulge at least four times a week and tot up a minimum of  units on a typical day - a bottle of wine, five pints or ten shots of spirit. Binge drinking - six or more units in a session - is also more common than among the general public. This would be four glasses of wine or six shorts, for instance. And they are more liable to feel guilty about their intake, reports BMJ Open. The findings confirm a longstanding suspicion MPs spend too much time consuming subsidised beer, wine and spirits while gossiping about colleagues in Westminster’s many bars and restaurants. They follow a crackdown on the ‘culture of excess’ at Parliament, which has been linked to complaints about bullying and harassment. Corresponding author Dr Tony Rao, a psychiatrist at King’s College London, said the objective was to explore “risky - hazardous, harmful and dependent - drinking among MPs”. He said: “The overall rate of risky drinking was higher than in the English population but did not dfer signicantly from groups comparable in both socio-economic and occupational status. “However, there were higher weighted averages among MPs for drinking at least four times per week, drinking at least  units on a typical drinking day, drinking six units or more in a single drinking episode, and feeling guilty about their drinking.” It raises the possibility of escalation into more serious alcohol-related harm, said Dr Rao.  He explained: “The selection bias of the sample of responders containing a higher proportion of women compared with the whole MP group, as well as the possibility of under-reporting through concerns over stigma, may underestimate both the quantity and frequency of risky drinking and the presence of alcohol-related harm. “It may have also underestimated the likelihood of even greater dferences in risky drinking for MPs with additional employment outside parliament and those with probable mental ill health.” All  MPs were invited to take part in an anonymous online survey in December  with  responding, of whom more than a thirdwere women. Around half were over . The low levels of participation may have been prompted by stigma or fear of being identied, said the researchers.

I didnapost save her number in my phone and clicked on what I thought was heraposs, but it turned out to be Stuart who had texted me about a late parcel delivery. The mum-of-one sent the message last year, but re-shared the mix-up when it popped back up on Facebook memories.She was visited by a health visitor for six weeks after giving birth to Jenson, now one, via C-section due to him being two weeks late and weighing lbs oz. The recovery process was pretty rough but after a couple of weeks I was back to normal, she said. When I heard my phone ping and realised I got a reply, I thought it was the health visitor texting me back, but then I saw it was from Stuart. He knew Iaposd be embarrassed so went about it in a nice way by sending a very professional reply and telling me to go see the GP.  I saw the health visitor soon after that text and told her about it - she found it hilarious too. I shared it on Facebook at the time because it was funny, I couldnapost believe Iaposd done it, and I re-shared it when I popped up as a Facebook memory because it makes me laugh every time I read it. Iaposve learned to always save numbers in my phone now, itaposs the last time thataposs happened, itaposs definitely been a case of lesson learned. Kind-hearted Stuart was at home when he received the message and said: Iaposm not qualied to dispense medical advice.

He’s always wanted to have a regular le and to get away from the spotlight, and that’s what heaposs doing, but it basically means walking away from his family. Harry’s a loving loyal guy so that will be very hard for him. The Duke has reportedly told friends that not being able to use his HRH title is a small price to pay for the freedom stepping down will give him.  Meghan and Harry are said to be excited about their future in Canada, especially setting up their new non-profit organisation in the spring.

Harry, , reportedly held a four-hour meeting with the monarch at Windsor Castle in an effort to clear the air before he quits royal duties at the end of the month.During the heart-to-heart on Sunday, The Sun says the -year-old monarch reportedly told her grandson: You are much loved and will always be welcomed back. The Duke of Sussex had walked the almost two miles from his Frogmore Cottage home and shared a light lunch of poached salmon, salad and tea with his grandmother.An aide said it was the ideal time to chat before Harry jets back to Canada with Meghan to be reunited with baby Archie. The insider said: The Queen had a lot to talk to Harry about and this was the ideal time for them to both say their piece. Following a stressful few weeks, it was the first time Harry and the Queen had spoken since the coupleaposs bombshell announcement that they were quitting royal duties.  The source said the Queen was very upset that Harry and Meghan were quitting and would ideally like to see more of nine-month-old Archie, as would the rest of the royals. She used the opportunity to stress that any new arrangement could only workthe couple do not exploit their royal status and try to aposcash inapos. Harry was said to have been deep in thought throughout the afternoon, with no one  witnessing the private chat. Harry and Meghan have been told they cannot use their Sussex Royal branding when they set up their new le, but in a barbed statement they said there was no legal restriction on doing this overseas.  Meghan will jet into the UK this week to carry out her final royal duties before they depart for North America and le as private citizens. However, Archie is not likely to join his parents and instead will be looked after in Canada by a nanny and Meghan’s best friend Jessica Mulroney. The cost of their security - an estimated £million per year - could still be picked up by the British taxpayer with Canada set to stop paying at the end of March. But Princess Dianaaposs former bodyguard Ken Wharfe this week said the Queen should pay to protect them - saying Archie is at real risk of being kidnapped. He said the little royal is probably safer staying in Canada and that it would be a disasterthe Sussexes lose their Scotland Yard officers and go private.  “It wouldn’t be safe and they need protection more than ever, continued Mr Wharfe, adding perhaps the Queen or Charles could stump up some or all of the cost of protection and give it back to the taxpayer. Harry and Meghanaposs last duty as senior royals will be at the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey next week alongside the Queen, Charles, Camilla, William and Kate. It is understood William and Harry no longer seeing eye to eye had initially paved the way for the Sussexesapos plans to depart the Firm.

It could keep your brain ticking over. Indeed it could do more than that, it could make your brain resistant to ageing, even improve your mental capacity, whatever your age.This is a fertile area of research, examining the benefits of speaking more than one language. One surprising study showed in people speaking only one language, the average age for developing the first signs of dementia was ., whereas it was . for people who speak two or more languages. Would you believe bilingual people remember shopping lists, names and directions better than people who speak only one language  Bilingual people are also more alert to their surroundings. They can focus on important details and ignore the less important ones. And now researchers at the ­University of Reading claim to be the first to “test the idea that speaking multiple languages protects against decline in brain ”.To do this they firstly compared the brain activity of bilingual people with and without multiple sclerosis. Then they compared the thinking abilities of people with and without MS who spoke only one language. They found that MS patients who spoke more than one language attained similar scores to bilingual people without MS.  In the other group, however, “patients [with MS] who only had fluency in one language performed worse than the mono- lingual control” group. This is a pretty spectacular result according to any criteria. What makes this study special is that it examined two cognitive ­s in detail. The first is known as “monitoring”, which is your ability to analyse a problem and change your way of thinking to come up with new solutions for solving problems and making decisions. It’s described as “thinking outside the box”.

Eli Perencevich, an infection prevention specialist, most people inadvertently wear them wrong and auto-contaminate themselves.In a Twitter post the professor said: Masks won’t protect the average person.Because they will wear them incorrectly and autocontaminate themselves. I’ve never seen a person practice hand hygiene before removing a mask in public and then after removing the mask. Mr Perencevich, who is a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Iowa’s College of Medicine also told Forbes magazine that the average healthy person does not need to have a mask, and they shouldn’t be wearing masks. He said: There’s no evidence that wearing masks on healthy people will protect them. They wear them incorrectly, and they can increase the risk of infection because they’re touching their face more often. The one time you would want a mask isyou’re sick and you have to leave the house. If you have the flu or think you have COVID, that’s when you’d put on a mask to protect others. In your house,you feel like you’re sick, you should wear a mask to protect your family members.  The World Health Organisation’s official advice also states: “If you are healthy, you only need to wear a maskyou are taking care of a person with suspected -nCoV infection”. The type of face masks being regularly used by the public are surgical masks which are loose fitting, intended for short periods and do not offer great protection with extended use, says the Science Media Centre. When a mask is worn, it must be combined with good hand hygiene to be effective and disposed of properly.The WHO said people should be cleaning hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.Schools should stay open unless theyaposre advised otherwise by Public Health England, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has told MPs.

Obviously, we look at it by position to try to make them better technically and tactically but we want all players comfortable in taking the ball.“We’re not fixated on systems and formations right across the club, we want to do what’s right for our inidual players.“It’s also about getting us to empower the coaches to be able to deliver those same messages across the board. We’re constantly reviewing and adapting our model. We don’t want to just stand still. We need to move forward with the modern trends of the game.“There’s needs to be a balance of letting kids express themselves and being free at certain points but also hammering home the technical and tactical elements of their game.”Of the environment at Tannadice, Courts added: “The club’s invested quite heavily in additional staff members like ourselves but also video analysis and physical performance.“We look at the full player as an athlete, first and foremost, but it’s all in collaboration with the technical, tactical and physical performance.“It’s a club on an upward trajectory again and they’ve got a phenomenal reputation historically for developing young players.“There’s a blueprint and something ingrained within the club. The calibre of people you are working with on a daily basis is great.

The games are stacking up a wee bit but we just have to get on with it.“We trained on Saturday and it’s one of those occasions when we’re grateful to have access to the indoor facility at the Regional Performance Centre.“It was a good session, which kept us ticking over for Tuesday night, and there were actually positives to the game going off.“Dave watched Alloa and Ayr on Saturday afternoon and Jimmy went to Dunfermline against Dundee United, which was obviously useful for the days ahead in terms of preparation.“So there’s frustration but we took the good side of it, too.”Meanwhile, James reacted to news of the club’s latest financial figures.The Dark Blues revealed losses of £. million at teatime on Friday – more than four times greater than the previous year’s deficit .The figures show how heavily the cost of relegation has hit Dundee in the pocket, with squad and managerial churn blamed for much of the club’s increased expenditure.Financial predictions for next year are also bleak.But the club’s majority shareholder – Tim Keyes and John Nelms’ Football Partners Scotland– have committed, in a statement released alongside the accounts, to continue providing funds.For the manager, who has enjoyed daily support from Nelms, that came as no surprise.But McPake remains aware of the pressing need toas quickly as possible to the Premiership, given the havoc dropping into the Championship has wreaked on the club’s balance sheet.“Some of it I can’t control but the bit of it I can control is the budget I’ve been given,” he said.“Regardless of what  has been going on and wherever  money has been needed, the owners have backed me from start to finish.“I have absolutely no complaints on that front. That has been the same for every other manager they have employed here – they’ve all been backed.“What we can do on the playing side is, as I’ve said before, make sure come April, May time, we’ve given ourselves the best possible chance of getting back to the Premiership.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/DNic_Tele_Fball_Podcast-8-scaled-e1582122918392-940x547.jpg ","title":"split reaction on plans to turn former bookies into ice cream parlour in dundee","story":"Plans for a new ice cream parlour and pancake house have been met with a mixed reaction in the area.The proposed site for the eatery, known as the Old Police Station, is a former bookmakers shop at the corner of Fintry Road and Finlarig Terrace.However, the response from residents and nearby shop bosses is ided.Originally plans were submitted to convert the bookies into a chip shop, but that prompted objections and the bid was rejected  by Dundee City Council.Now the businessman behind that move has put forward proposals for an ice cream parlour and pancake house with opening hours set from pm to pm.One nearby resident Bill Findlay, , of Finlarig Terrace, was against the idea and insisted: #There#s enough eateries here and we have them all over the place.#There#s a couple of chippies near here and you have Baynes the bakers across the road and Butties plus the Scotmid sells hot and cold food to take away too.#And so does the Co-op, it sells hot rolls in the morning.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

It was all so surprising.#I have never won anything for essentially just being myself. Anyone  in the category absolutely deserved to win, so it really is an honour.#Throughout high school, Josh was a victim of bullying, struggling to understand who he was as a person and confused by his own thoughts and feelings.

It wasn#t until moving to Glasgow and being more involved with the LGBTQ+ community he gained a better understanding of himself and being transgender.Returning home to Lochgilphead, Josh came out as transgender, ultimately finding his true self.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"reston-station-plans-submitted","story":"HOPES have been raised this week of another train station being created in the Borders.For over a decade campaigners have been calling for an East Coast Mainline stop at Reston in Berwickshire.The Scottish Government has included a new station in its spending plans for the next five years.And this week Network Rail tabled a screening request to Scottish Borders Councils planning department.The outline plans for a new Reston Station include -metre s either side of the Berwick-to-Edinburgh line as well as a footbridge, shelters and a -space car park.The plans will be considered over the coming weeks by planning officials."},{"url":null,"title":"shook-finger-clickin-good","story":"DONT be too surprisedtheres a few turned-up collars and pairs of blue suede shoes on Selkirk High Street this week.The towns Victoria Hall has been transported back to the swinging s.And the hand-clapping, finger-clicking frolics of All Shook Up is certain to send toe-tapping shockwaves all around the Royal Burgh.If there is a need to remind the world of the genius of Elvis Presley, Selkirk Musical Theatre Companys stunning adaptation of the Joe DiPietro theatre play will have Souters creating new Spoty playlists for months to come.But its not just the terric versions of the songs that make this hilarious, hip-swinging show such a success.The Selkirk cast, whose numbers have swollen in recent years, is stronger now than it has ever been.And its the confidence and playfulness of the actors, along with their exceptionally fine voices, that makes sure the hugely ambitious All Shook Up is a rock n roll triumph.Its a bit like all your favourite episodes of Happy Days rolled into one -

with only pound million coming from an insurance settlement.The claim that there will be a pound million deficit has led to MSP Christine Grahame seeking clarication.The councils chief finance officer David Robertson has confirmed that Peebles High has an insurance value of pound million.And that the local authority is working with loss adjuster appointed by Zurich on a final settlement - expected to be made next month.But the correspondence has now thrown up more questions, with Ms Grahame demanding to know where a pound million deficit will occur.She told us: \"The claims being made by Councillor Haslam and her Tory colleagues are going to be massively concerning for the school community.\"As soon as the scale of the damage from the fire was apparent I wrote to SBC to check that insurance would cover the cost of rebuilding ndash I was told yes, it should.ldquoCllr Haslam has already been caught in one lie by saying the Scottish Government has refused funding for the rebuild when SBC have never requested it. And why would itit was covered by insurance ldquoIs it the case that the insurance company has rejected a claim for new build and will pay only for reinstatement of the damaged areas  If that is the case then she should come clean. She is claiming the school faces a pound million deficit.\"The only explanation I can offer is that this is the cost of replacement of damaged areas but on this Ms Haslam is silent.ldquoI await her response, but in the interim I would ask her seriously to desist in trying to play politics with this to get a disingenuous hit on the Scottish Government and SNP.\"It serves no one and is unnecessarily causing genuine concern amongst the local community when efforts should be going into ing stability and normality to students, parents and staff.Scottish Borders Councils administration has committed to delivering replacement secondary schools in Galashiels, Hawick and Peebles in the next six years.Councillor Haslam believes that an improved replacement school for Peebles school along with using parts of the remaining building needs to be factored in to the calculations.In a response to Christine Grahame, she said: \"As you are well aware the insurance will only pay to replace what was lost.\"This will still result in a music department in a windowless basement and a science department in labs that are not fit for purpose.\"Despite this our school continues to produce first class scientists and musicians but I believe they deserve more and better.\"We had planned to replace Peebles High School in the next  years. To only do part of the school now would be a  economy and impact on future plans to replace outdated buildings.\"I know how keen you are to see a new High School delivered in Galashiels so am perplexed as to why you are so against Peebles getting the same facilities  Perhaps you could clary  I am certainly not satisfied with half measures for our young people.\"We are also extremely keen to ensure that other towns developments are not held back as a result of this fire. So Galashiels and Hawick remain on schedule to be delivered. This means that our Conservative led council will be delivering three new High schools, two new primary schools in the next six years, quite an achievement as I am sure you will agree.\"This is held

There Rolyrsquos cricketing talents were quickly spotted, and as a member of the schoolrsquos st XI he had the distinction of hitting a six into the stands at Lordrsquos in the annual fixture against Cheltenham.On leaving school he was offered an apprenticeship by his uncle, David Ballantyne, in the family-run Henry Ballantyne  Sons mill at Walkerburn. It afforded him an invaluable insight into the business, supplemented by day release classes at the nearby Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels.Additional work placements were undertaken at Ballantyne Sportswearrsquos Caerlee Mills in Innerleithen and at another family-run mill in Dalkeith. By his mid-s, Roly had been appointed mill manager at Ballantynersquos March Street Mills in Peebles.In  the Peebles operation was taken over by DawsonLtd ndash later to become Dawson International plc ndash before a restructuring of the Dawson empire in the mid-s saw Robert Noble Ltd take over as the new management company at March Street Mills.By now Mr Brett has risen to become the firmrsquos production director, and a further change of ownership came in the late s when Robert Noble was sold to Yorkshire-based textile company Moorhouse  Brook. Shortly afterwards Robert Noblersquos new managing director resigned, and Mr Brett was appointed his successor, remaining in post with the company until his retiral in  at the age of .Richard Ryley, a sales director with Robert Noble who worked alongside Mr Brett for  years, described him as a great colleague and incredibly approachable. ldquoHe was respected and well-liked not only by workers at the mill, but by associates in the textile trade throughout the United Kingdom and beyond.ldquoHe possessed great charm, but never shied away from making big or tough decisions. He was a wonderful mentor, and I will always be grateful for his sound advice and the support he willingly gave to myself and to all members of staff.In  he was appointed Deacon of the Scottish Borders Manufacturersrsquo Corporation, later serving as a Walkerburn Community Councillor, and for a time was a director of Live Borders, the culture, sport and leisure trust for the Scottish Borders.However, without a doubt the most important event in Roly Brettrsquos le was his marriage to Betty Taylor, at that time working as an auditor with Edinburgh firm Rolleston Somerville. They first met by chance, as Rolyrsquos cousin Alastair happened to be going out with Bettyrsquos flatmate Stroma.Love quickly blossomed, and Roly and Betty were married in Strathdon Church, Aberdeenshire, on September , . After honeymooning in Perthshire, the couple set up home in a rented cottage at Cardrona, then at Kaimend, Innerleithen, before a final move in  to the family home at Caberston House, Walkerburn.The couplersquos four sons - Chris, Jeremy, Mike and Alex ndash were all schooled locally and shared their fatherrsquos passion for sport and motor cars. Family le meant everything to Roly, with Betty and the boys always at the centre of his le.His exploits on the cricket field matched his business achievements. A member of the England Schools side that included future test stars Mike Brearley and Richard Hobbs, the young all-rounder turned down a county contract with Lancashire and opted instead to play his cricket north of the border.An elegant batsman and skilful off-spin bowler, Rolyrsquos cricket career included spells with the Dunfermline, Kelso and Selkirk clubs. He captained Selkirk on their ground-breaking tour to Barbados in , and the following year led the Souters to a Border League  Border Knock-out Cup double.Once his playing days were over, Roly qualied as a cricket coach, helping steer the South of Scotland u- side to its first Scottish Championship.A familiar adversary during his cricketing career was Gala wicket-keeper Ronnie Murray. ldquoRoly was a breath of fresh air when he first arrived on the Border scene, said Ronnie. ldquoHe was an excellent all-rounder, a true sportsman and also great fun to be with.ldquoHe played in a very good Kelso team that included players like John Rutherford and Michael Taylor, before helping inspire Selkirk to a string of successes in the s. You could always depend on Roly to anchor an innings, while he had a knack of picking up quick wickets when he came on to bowl.Golf was another sport at which he excelled, twice winning the Woollen Merchants  Manufacturers Cup, competed for annually at Sunningdale. The ornate trophy is kept on display at the British Golf Museum in St Andrews.As well as being a member of Peebles Golf Club, he also held memberships with Luffness Golf Club in East Lothian and Port Salon Golf Club in Donegal, close to Rathmullan where his father moved after retiring from the army.An interest in classic cars led to the ownership of a number of models being kept at Walkerburn over the years, including a vintage Daimler, Porsche and Mercedes SL.In  Mr Brett was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia, a progressive condition affecting behaviour, personality and speech.As the disease began to take its inevitable toll, the love and support shown by Betty, members of his family and close friends , in addition to the kindness and understanding shown by staff in the BGHrsquos Cauldshiels Ward and at Murray House, Kelso, ensured Roly received the best possible care in his final months.Mr Brett is survived by Betty and their four sons, his sister Jo, brother Will, daughters-in-law Denise, Shona, Debbie and Mumba, and by eight grandchildren.A service of thanksgiving for Roly Brettrsquos le will be held in the Borders Crematorium, Melrose, on Tuesday, March , at pm.J.D.R.S."},{"url":null,"title":"dates-confirmed-2020-innerleithen-music-festival","story":"ORGANISERS have announced that this years Innerleithen Music Festival will take place during the weekend of August -to-.Now in its th year the festival continues to provide a great  for fantastic music in the heart of the Borders.True to its tradition there will be events taking place across multiple venues in Innerleithen.And, as usual, much of the activity will be centred at the Vale Club where lsquoLive and Localrsquo will be staged over the three days.Andy Wright from Innerleithen Music Festival said: \"The Innerleithen Music Festival has a strong reputation amongst artists and audience alike.\"Bands and singers approach us throughout the year enquiring about performance opportunities.\"Over the years we have showcased hundreds of bands and solo performers from across Scotland and farther afield, including such household names as Eddie Reader, Capercaillie, Skipinnish as well as traditional music favourites Phil and Aly.\"Last year one of our largest audiences was for local musician and rising star Tommy Ashby who is currently carving out a great reputation on the national music scene.\"Ahead of the festival this summer a fundraising concert will be held in the Union Club on Saturday, March .Already confirmed for next months concert are Redwood Rejects, Soul , All the Angels, Bobs Boiler Room and Dylan Paterson.Tickets go on sale from lsquoThe Hub on the High Streetrsquo, Innerleithen on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"gareths-newspaper-snaps-help-replace-peebles-high-camera","story":"A local photographer who captured haunting images of firefighters tackling the blaze at Peebles High School has donated the profits of his pictures to the school.Award winning photographer Gareth Easton was in Peebles when his children, both pupils at Peebles High, called to say the school was on fire.This week he spoke to reporter and former colleague Hilary Scott, about how he turned his pictures of the pupils running from the burning school, into an image of students with beaming smiles.INNERLEITHEN photographer Gareth Easton has snapped murder scenes, G riots, drugs raids, and even gambled with his own le aboard a trawler by capturing the danger inherent in commercial fishing ndash which netted him a national award.Never did he imagine that his next big job would be photographing the inferno of the secondary school both his children attend.ldquoOn the day of the fire I was working in Peebles.

You should self-isolateyou have travelled to any of the following places:to Hubei province in China in the last  daysto Iran, areas of northern Italy in lockdown or \"special care zone\" areas in South Korea since  Februaryto other parts of mainland China or South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last  days and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathto other parts of northern Italy , Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos or Myanmar since  February and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathHow do I self-isolate The best place to self-isolate yourself is obviously your own home, where you should stay for the duration of your quarantine.This means you shouldnt go to work, school or public areas, and not use any public transport or taxis.If you need something from outside your home, you canask friends, family members or delivery services to carry out errands for you.But youre advised to try to avoid visitors to your home, though it is OK for friends and family or delivery drivers to drop off food and other supplies.WhatIm not at home Of course, its possible that any coronavirus symptoms could arise while youre out and about.If this is the case, the official advice insists that you do not go to a GP surgery or hospital, as that could spread the virus inordinately.Instead, you should try to find a room to isolate yourself away from others. Ask for helpyou need to, but try to stay at least two metres away from other people.Open a window for ventilationyou can, but otherwise touch objects and surfaces as little as possible, and call  for

lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, can my employer deduct my pay for the time I am away from work This will depend on the facts.If you are otherwise fit for work but are taking precautionary steps by lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, technically you are not entitled to pay.However, it is good practice for employers not to deduct pay in these situations.An employee would usually be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo on the advice of a doctor and it is sensible for an employer to show understanding in order to fulfil health and safety obligation and maintain good staff relations.In addition, to withhold pay could encourage an employee toto work prematurely which might potentially risk spreading the virus.Many employers can allow temporary flexible working arrangements where employees can work from home.What are my rightsIrsquom quarantined and my boss refuses to pay my salary If you have contracted the virus, normal rules around sick pay will apply and you will either receive Statutory Sick Payor contractual sick pay.If your employer has specically told you not to come into the workplace as you have been in or to an affected area, you would ordinarily receive your normal pay.What is unclear is a situation where an employee remains off work as they have been quarantined or recommended to isolate themselves.In those circumstances, it would not strictly be considered as sick as the reason for the absence isnrsquot because the employee is unwell and therefore has no entitlement to sick pay.There may be a contractual clause relating to such circumstances and how this time off should be paid.In the absence of any contractual clause, the position will be that the leave will be unpaid .Can I be forced to use my annual leaveI am lsquoself-isolatingrsquo You cannot be forced to use

are being forced to take.For example, to force you to use  daysrsquo holiday, your employer must give you  daysrsquo notice.Again, this may risk good staff relations and given that employers and employees will likely be unfamiliar in dealing with a health crisis of this magnitude, it will be good practice for both parties to mutually agree how leave will be taken.,params: .pushWill I be paid

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis. She wanted tae keep winter going sae her power would last longer. She whipped up a gale wi a wind sae cauld and sharp it felt like a bird pecking at yer skin. It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength. She bade her time there, kenning she would be able taeand reclaim her throne when darkness once again ed tae the land.ldquoIn autumn, said one of the children.ldquoAye, smiled the gran.ldquoAnd thatrsquos why we hae arsquo these winds and storms just noo. Beria is trying tae stop spring and the rule orsquo Queen Bride. And we still hae the three days orsquo snaw tae come, but ater that Beria will huv tae flee.ldquoWhy didnrsquot they kill Beria, then itrsquoll be summer all the time  asked one of the older children.The gran smiled. ldquoAngus was Beriarsquos son. They were all related, just like the seasons, although they fought each other for a place they all needed each other and were part of the same family.ldquoJust like us.ldquoAye.ldquoGran, can we have more hot chocolate and can you tell us the other stories about Beria  asked a grandchild.ldquoOrsquo course, said the gran, ldquobut we wud need a hale winter tae tell arsquo the stories aboot her.

Some of it is about changing the language, the words, and some of it is about better understanding the way in which many voters think. Properly done, it could be a way to convince people like me to support independence.:Joanna Cherry: I dont want to replace Nicola. I want to get to know herWhatrsquos got me thinking about all of this today is the interview the nationalist MP Joanna Cherry did with my colleague Kevin McKenna at the weekend because Ms Cherry was guilty of a lot of the kind of behaviour that winds voters up, and I would suggest needs to change. Talking about independence asitrsquos inevitable, for example, or dismissing concerns about the economy or borders with a wave of the hand. It makes many people think that politicians like Ms Cherry arenrsquot taking their worries seriously. It makes them dig down into their trenches a little bit deeper.So, herersquos a few ways that I think things that could be done dferently ndash a few ways in which the nationalists could adjust their strategy ndash and the first would be to talk more realistically about what independence actually means. Some nationalists delight in the thought of cutting the ties with England and some unionists are horried by the idea, but the reality is that after a Yes vote, the ties would still exist. Scotland would have constitutional independence, but not independence in any total sense: our ability to be autonomous would be limited just as it is for every other nation in the world, including the UK after Brexit.Talking to voters about independence in this more realistic way would be good for the nationalist cause because it would be less horrying for unionists or waverers. Indeed, the SNP has not always used the word ldquoindependence as prominently as it does now and for a long time preferred the phrase ldquoself-government. Naturally, talking about independence fires up the SNP base, but a better approach for general voters would be to talk about Scottish self-government within a new family of nations. Itrsquos a more mature and realistic idea that many voters could buy into.The second idea for a new approach for the SNP tackles the tricky subject of nationality and identity. The Scottish and British identities are not going to disappear from Scotland just because therersquos been a Yes vote and the SNP needs to acknowledge thatitrsquos to win over voters who feel British. Many SNP supporters and some of its leading figures have attempted to undermine the British identity or dismiss it or mock it and when they do so, therersquos a backlash, which isnrsquot surprising: people cling more tightly to their identity when they think itrsquos under threat. Wersquore back in the trenches again.Instead, the SNP needs to start talking about the ways it would respect and protect the British identity in Scotland after a Yes vote. Nicola Sturgeon did a little of this in her speech on the day Britain left the EU, but not nearly enough. She needs to explain to people that their British identity will be valued and protected even when there is constitutional independence, by guaranteeing a form of dual nationality for Scots born in the UK for example. Changing the constitutional status of a country does not change peoplersquos sense of cultural, social and personal identity.Which leads us to the subject of Scottish identity and how the SNP approach to that needs to change. First, the party needs to stop talking asthe values ascribed to a Scottish identity are in some way discrete or superior theyrsquore not. It also needs to dial down on the panic that it sometimes tries to spread that the Scottish identity is under threat from the UK or the Tories. The Scotsrsquo sense of identity was strong before the Act of Union, it was strong after, and itrsquos strong now. Also, no-one in government at Westminster has ever talked about the full assimilation of Scotland into the UK and playing up such threats strikes many voters as hysterical and silly. The SNP should do itself a favour and stop doing it.There are a few other ways in which the SNP could re-tune its strategy. For example, it should start talking about building a ldquosettled will in Scotland rather than promoting the idea that the constitution can, or should, be changed on .% of the vote . Scottish nationalistsshould also avoid adversarial and aggressive language and behaviour: less shouting, less pointing, less marching.:Scottish independence support maintains lead in latest pollFinally, the leading proponents of independence should avoid, at all costs, using any of the delusional and misleading techniques we saw in the Brexit debate. In her Herald interview, Joanna Cherry said any concerns that voters might have about the Scotland England border after independence were misplaced the idea, she said, that people wouldnrsquot be able to have a cup of tea in Berwick without showing their passport was ludicrous. But it was exactly that kind of rebuttal ndash dismissal with a pah ndash that the Brexiters tried when they were challenged about the border in Northern Ireland.Another example would be the cabinet minister Mike Russellrsquos recent comments on the economy. Mr Russell said Scotland pays out more than it gets back from the UK, a comment he might as well have plastered on the side of a bus, just like Boris Johnson did during the Brexit debate. It was an outrageous claim to make and outrageous claims only underline the need for a new, more realistic approach. Mr Russell has announced he is quitting Holyrood. Quite a few other nationalist MSPs have too. Maybe we will finally get it."},{"url":null,"title":"health-chief-promises-business-usual-coronavirus-spreads-across-scotland","story":"Dr Catherine Calderwood was speaking afterthe first case of Covid- was confirmed north of the border.A Tayside resident who had recently travelled from the north of Italy has been admitted to hospital and is currently receiving treatment in isolation.:Scotland registers first confirmed coronavirus case... with more predictedSpeaking on the BBCrsquos Good Morning Scotland, Dr Calderwood discussed testing at some GP practices, potential self-isolation and going through a ldquovery detailed history of which people cases have been in contact with.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Thirteen new UK coronavirus cases as total climbs to \",\"description\": \"Thirteen new UK coronavirus cases as total climbs to \",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media adYNNA poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests adYNNA.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": She said the first person to test positive in Scotland is ldquoclinically well, adding they were ldquotransferred to hospital last night as a precautionary measure only.When askedthe case was related to Scotlandrsquos recent Six Nations rugby match away to Italy, she said: ldquoWe know that some areas of Italy the Italian government have put in lockdown because of a very high risk of coronavirus transmission there and we now have many cases all over Italy.ldquoI think that we will find other parts of Italy will have cases and perhaps there are many people who have travelled for all sorts of events ndash this risk now is going to become not specic to certain sporting events but the fact that the virus is now spreading across Europe.ldquoI think in the UK we have done extremely well, that prediction of mine some weeks ago has only now happened because of that containment.ldquoThe public can really help us and wersquore going to keep saying these messages: wash your hands, donrsquot touch your face, sneeze or cough into a tissue and bin it immediately, and that can still help to contain this so we reduce the number of people itrsquos transmitted to.:Boris Johnson to chair coronavirus Cobra meeting as UK cases reach ldquoWe would expect at least % of people to have very mild illness that they will recover quickly from and a very small number of people that need hospitalisation.

People can turn up, work and provide a passport of their EU driving licence and that will not have any implications for the rest of the UK.ldquoWe have another open border with the Republic of Ireland, and we operate a common travel area. There is no reason why that canrsquot happen with Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.The MP for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East added that the policy could create a ldquobig danger in terms of exploitation of workers.He explained: ldquo The big danger and potential cause of illegal work and trafficking iswe have a system in place where demand for workers is not being met.ldquoThat is the danger of what the UK government has announced in recent weeks.ldquoThe demand for people to work in agriculture or lower paid jobs is not going to be met now. there will be people willing to fill that gap through trafficking or exploitation, illegal working.The Fragomen report states ldquoany regional policy iations on the governmentrsquos proposed system would not open a ldquoback door for illegal immigration to other parts of the UK.It adds: ldquoWe reject arguments that free movement in Scotland, or perhaps any regional flexibilities, would create a back door to the wider UK labour market...The government is already relying on in-country controls to prevent any abuse, for instance right to work checks, whether relating to visa free travel from the US and where, or through the borderless common travel area with Ireland.ldquoThe government could rely on those same checks for migrants moving from Scottish free movement to a UK immigration system. Concerns that this will create a back door do not stack up, when the UKrsquos front door is wide open.It also suggests lowering the pound, salary threshold for workers coming to Scotland, creating a separate Migration Advisory Committee,three-year post-study work visas and waiving the fees for NHS visa applications.It comes after business leaders warned up to a fth of Scottish firms may be forced to close under the plans, while others said they were completely unprepared and had no clue how they would recruit enough staff.The agriculture, fishing, tourism and care sectors are thought to be worst affected by the proposals, as well as rural areas where, experts say, there are barely any jobs with salaries over the threshold required for a visa.A Home Office spokesman said: ldquoThe UK Points-Based Immigration System makes sure that everyone working in this country can prove that they have the right to be in the UK. This will help to identy iniduals being exploited and we remain absolutely committed disrupting criminal traffickers and unscrupulous employers.Our new Points-Based Immigration System will work in the interests of the whole of the United Kingdom. The independent Migration Advisory Committee have recommended a single, less restrictive system to help attract the brightest and the best from around the globe. We will continue to work with stakeholders and industry in Scotland to ensure the new proposals work for all sectors."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-wanupmanship","story":"A DIARY tale about medical acronyms inspires Russell Smith to get in touch. ldquoThe most common, although not necessarily annotated, medical acronym is GOK, says our well-informed reader.

Giovanni Boccacciorsquos book was written immediately after the Black Death wiped out almost half the population of Europe in the th century. In The Decameron a group of wealthy, beautul, young nobles lock themselves up in a stately home in northern Italy, and tell stories to one another to pass the time while the plague ravages the countryside outside. Itrsquos like an apocalyptic forerunner of The Canterbury Tales.Not long after the British crew gets to northern Italy to film The Decameron, with the set a real-le stately home, they find they have to lsquoself-isolatersquo as coronavirus is on the warpath beyond the walls.

Then coronavirus hopped on its horse called Globalisation and made its way west.

The route had been changed because of severe weather over the previous week, making for a course that was very heavy underfoot and flooded in several places.Todd managed to get to the front of the queue at the line and set off at a steady pace, settling in to a position within the top  or so runners after the initial surge.Over the next  minutes she maintained her form and starting easing her way up through the field to settle in sixth place as the runner approached the final quarter of the race.As the finish was coming into sight, Todd started to kick for home and her efforts were rewarded as she moved up to fourth and battled all the way to the finish line to maintain that position, getting it on the line with no more than a foot’sfrom the athlete in fth place.Coach David Wagstaff said it was a fantastic achievement for the youngster, who was not only a great prospect for the future in athletics but also an aspiring triathlete who was doing well on the junior circuit.Todd and her parents thanked NorthLink Ferries, without whose generous sponsorship participation in the cross country championships would not have been possible..."},{"url":null,"title":"advertising sales representative full and part time at the shetland times ","story":"The Shetland Times Ltd is looking for a bright, enthusiastic and energetic advertising sales representative who must be a team player.This is a full-time post,  hours per week, am-pm Monday-Thursday, am-pm Friday.It is an opportunity to sell our range of promotional packages to current clients and prospective customers.As a part of our sales team you will meet clients face to face on a regular basis as well as make telephone sales calls.You will play a key role in selling and administering advertising and promotional offers.and is capable of meeting ious publication deadlines.A good understanding of Microsoft Office suite, keyboard skills and high levels of literacy and spelling are expected.Marketing sales experience would be an advantage.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

In early , they decided to have insulation work carried out in their home following a cold call by Mark Crilly. that Mr Crilly, a former footballer who played for the likes of Ayr United, St Mirren, and Raith Rovers, came to their bungalow in July  and offered to carry out ious jobs as part of a grant scheme. Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team. February  to begin the work and fitted the staircase. February that the remaining materials would be delivered on st February and that the fitters would then finish the staircase. February in which she outlined work outstanding and issues related to the work carried out along with photographic evidence of it. She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business. There is no money in the bank to repairwhat he has done.” contacted Mr Crilly for comment, but we have not received a response."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/001WH2102NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week service users at Tigh na Drochaid Resource Centre in Portree produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from street busker to empire headliner","story":"JOHN Garrity is a familiar face to many around Belfast city centre, entertaining shoppers with his on-street busking.Originally from Enniskillen, the -year-old has made Belfast his home ever since ing from a spell in America and next month is set to headline a gig in the Empire with companion Jonathan Cariaga in a duo known as the  Johnatones.John, who has had a lelong passion for music, decided he wanted to have a shot at making a living from it.“When I left school, I was doing my best to focus on music. It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John. He is a really free and open singer so we can play whatever we want all the time.“I am so excited about the gig in the Empire. I really like the place and always wanted to play there.”John Garrity live in concert at the Belfast Empire is on Sunday, March . Doors open at pm.

And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they just cant get enough of shirley","story":"PATHOS, poignancy, hilarity and a fortnight in Greece will collide once again as Tara Lynne O’Neill revives her Shirley Valentine on the Lyric stage this month.Before the initial Shirley run back in September, she had been approached to play one of Willy Russell’s most iconic creations by Lyric Executive Producer Jimmy Fay, a part, at the time, she had no hesitation in accepting., words of script later, Tara Lynne, along with director Patrick J O’Reilly, is preparing to bring the housewe back along with a lot of “sun shimmer” for a limited run at the end of this month.When we meet, Tara has just ed from Dublin where she was reading for Embrace a Giant Spirit, a Seamus Heaney showcase in Christ Church were she read his poem, Markings. In between dodging the last remnants of Storm Ciara, the former St Genevieve’s High School pupil and Derry Girls actress is warm, funny and straight talking about how her version of Willy Russell’s creation is “very much of this particular period in time”.She said: “Audiences have come with their friends, then they’ve come again and brought their mums, mother-in-laws, it’s phenomenal. Audiences feel like Shirley and it’s a gt that they want to give to other people. With the character of Shirley, I suppose it’s that thing that people always talk about, about being a ‘strong female lead’. Well, what is a strong female lead  To me, a strong female lead is someone who is flawed, they show their flaws. Shirley is just every woman and that is what is beautul about her. The character of Shirley has so many dilemmas that every woman faces, no matter what we are.“In the play Shirley talks about being back in school, she believed that good things were not meant for her.“A lot of us come out of school feeling like that or afraid to try stuff because we are afraid to fail.“I’ve been asked to contribute to a piece ITV are doing for International Women’s Day in March – what would you say to your younger self  The only thing I would say to my younger self is to try stuff, fail,you fail what is the worst that can happen  You get back up and you do it again, you do it better. This industry is constantly trying, but you can also play it safe. Shirley has been afraid to make mistakes her whole le. She’s got the . children, the nice house, it’s spotless, the husband, Joe, he’s out working, there isn’t much more she can do. It’s basically a question then of, ‘Is this it ’“Yes, Shirley is  and when I say that on stage people laugh because today, in , it’s so young. But actually  years ago  seemed older, people acted and carried themselves older. I’m  and I go, ‘Well, I’m young.’ We’ve come a long way, I think.”During the production’s initial run, Tara Lynne spoke of how, post-show, she had some “brilliant, absolutely incredible conversations” with women and men of all ages.“I had women in their s want to talk about the play, sixth form students talk to me about how they related to it.”Tara Lynne said that the revival of the play is also a fitting tribute to her friend and assistant director, Julie Maxwell, who tragically passed away last August during a night out in the city centre.“I know we all will truly miss her, I truly miss Julie, I have all the notes that she gave me during our first run of rehearsals. I feel that the success of the show and its second staging is a good way to honour her.”When the curtain comes down on this run, Tara Lynne will be preparing to start filming for the juggernaut that is Channel Four’s smash hit Derry Girls. Playing Ma Mary, the matriarch of the Quinn McCool clan, Tara Lynne has gained something of a cult following with her s perm, jumpers and ‘punt purse’ throughout the show’s two series.“We will hopefully be getting the script soon and I’ve no idea what is in them yet. We will be filming May through to July and I can’t wait to see everybody and the third series will be out later in the year. I’ve also written a play for the Belfast Festival later in the year so it’s very much a case of watch this space.”•Shirley Valentine willto the Lyric Theatre from February  until March .

Opening positions set out by the two sides ahead of the negotiations suggested there are major dferences on issues including fishing rights, Brussels# demands for a level playing field to ensure fair competition and the role of the European Court of Justice. At the European Commission#s Berlaymont headquarters in Brussels, Mr Frost was joined by the UK#s ambassador to the EU Sir Tim Barrow and a team of aides. Talks are expected to continue until Thursday, with a further set of negotiations planned in London later in March. The UK is refusing to extend talks beyond the end of the year and has warned it will walk away without a trade deal rather than see the process drag on. A high-level meeting to take stock of progress is scheduled for June, by which time it should be clear whether the Canada-style trade agreement sought by Mr Johnson is possible by the end of the year. The UK#s approach to negotiations states that the broad outline of a deal should be apparent by that point, which could then be finalised by September. If not, the Government will need to decide whether the UK#s attention should move away from negotiations and focus solely on continuing domestic preparations to exit the transition period in an orderly fashion. Michael Gove, the Cabinet minister responsible for overseeing the UK#s exit from the EU, said Britain would not trade away its newly recovered sovereignty during the talks. French Europe minister Amelie de Montchalin warned the Prime Minister that the tight December  deadline would not pressure the EU  into agreeing fresh terms. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said neither he nor his Scottish counterpart are considering checks on goods at ports.Last week, Tanaiste Simon Coveney warned that there would be a signicant impact on the trade negotiationsthe UK does not implement the requirements of the Northern Ireland protocol.He saidthere isn#t progress on the infrastructure needed to implement the Irish protocol as part of the Withdrawal Agreement in the next few months then I think that is going to be a very worrying signal for whether or not it is going to be possible to conclude something sensible before the end of the year.But Mr Poots yesterday told MLAs: In the infrastructure that is being sought by Simon Coveney, we are looking at tens of thousands of checks on goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, which will create a huge pressure on business.He added: I should say that neither the Northern Ireland minister nor, indeed, the Scottish minister have expressed that they are willing to accept any checks at any ports. Scotland was as firm as I was on that: we would not put infrastructure in our ports to facilitate that. If Mr Coveney had his way, there would be tens of thousands of checks, damaging those just-in-time goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That would be hugely detrimental to the shops, convenience stores and supermarkets that provide food that has been produced in Great Britain and comes to Northern Ireland. Again, that will have a huge impact on our consumers.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadUK warned it can#t renege on Brexit Irish sea border agreementI voted Leave on basis of  Brexit information, says Catholic farmerWhat has EU done for Northern Ireland  Interactive map details £million pumped in projects Revealed: The vital medicines that may be impossible to getUK crashes out of EuropePatel accused of ‘famine threats’ as she says risk of food shortages could be used against Republic,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The title of the book came from a question Ethan, who does not have autism, asked Mr Morrows mum when he was just three. Mr Morrow said he started writing the book to record his childhood and journey into fatherhood, after realising that most of the books on autism focused on children with the condition, not parents.It was a bit of a bucket list thing, to have a book published before I was ,”he said. I wanted to make a record of my early le and Ethans early le.Im proudly autistic now but that wasnt always the case.I used to try and hide it.After sending it off to a string of literary agents with no success, Jude self-published the book which has since earned a number of five star reviews and attracted the attention of one of the worlds leading consultants on autism, Maisie Soetantyo.Why Does Daddy Always Look so Sad  also caught the eye of an American literary agent who took it to Beyond Words Publishing, the publisher behind the self help book The Secret.Impressed by Judes warts and all story which detailed his childhood struggle with autism through to adapting becoming a parent, they agreed to launch the book in the US with a speaking tour which will include a guest lecture at Calornias Stanford University.Beyond Words Publishing get submissions from all over the world but they only publish about  books a year so for them to publish my book is just unbelievable, said Jude.I never in my widest dreams thought this was going to happen. The publishers said the book resonates with people because its not about swimming the channel or climbing Everest, Im just a normal, relatable person.Im remarkably unremarkable but they thought it was important to get my story out there.Since publishing the book last year, Jude has given a series of talks and book signings which have given the -year-old social worker the chance to reach out to children with autism.I love meeting autistic kids,” he said,They are like me and I am like them.Im not in the business of giving parenting advice and when I give a talk to parents its always the kids who ask the questions.Theres a misconception that autistic kids dont know they are dferent.I want to tell them that things will be grand.He has also been contacted by people from around the world who have been touched by his story and he has encouraged anyone with questions to get in touch with him online.I reach out to people all the time and I have a black belt in responding, said Jude.Why Does Daddy Always Look so Sad  is available on Amazon in both paper back and ebook.For more information see www.judemorrow or Jude Morrow Author on Facebook. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Catholic Church has therefore taken the decision to “suspend” the Sign of Peace during religious services and advised that water fonts should not be used. Bishop McKeown said: “Most physical interaction during religious services, e.g. shaking hands while exchanging the ‘Sign of Peace’ in Christian religious services, involves a low risk of spreading the virus, especiallymembers of the congregation who are unwell do not attend religious services while they are ill. “However, because COVID- is a new disease that has not been seen in people before, we need to exercise extreme caution to limit the spread of the virus.” googletag.cmd.push Current information suggests that COVID- can spread easily between people and could be spread from an infected person even before they develop any symptoms. For these reasons the church has decided that physical interaction during religious services, including the Sign of Peace, should be suspended. He added: “The practice of shaking hands on greeting and departure at religious services gatherings should be suspended for both religious leaders clergy and laity. “Because COVID- is a new disease and appears to spread easily between people, we advise that holy water fonts should not be used. “Using communal vessels during religious services, e.g. drinking from the Chalice during Holy Communion in Christian services. To minimise the risk of spread of infection, the use of communal vessels should be suspended. googletag.cmd.push “For example, during Holy Communion in Christian religious services only the celebrant should drink from the Chalice.

At the beginning of February the Derry News reported that Derry City  Strabane District Council expected Stormont to announce poundm of City Deal match funding within weeks. A formal announcement has not yet been made. The council also indicated that negotiations were ongoing with the NI government to secure an additional poundm to match the total UK Governmentpackage of poundm towards a Derry City and Strabane Region Deal. Now, a Department of Finance spokesperson has said Sinn Feacutein minister Conor Murphy supports match funding. googletag.cmd.push The spokesperson stated: “The Minister will be taking a paper to the Executive seeking its agreement to match funding for City Deals. “As the Minister has expressed his support for Match Funding for Inclusive Future Funds this will also be included as a recommendation in the paper.” The current package, pound million for the City Deal and poundm for the new Inclusive Future Fund, aims to boost the economic potential of the city and support a more prosperous and united community. The Derry City and Strabane City Deal investment will help strengthen innovation and the digital potential of the city region and unlock local partner funding. googletag.cmd.push It will be bolstered by a poundm Inclusive Future Fund aimed at bringing greater prosperity and social benefits to the whole of the community. Ulster University will be granted poundm of the pound already committed. Official council documents indicate it may be given additional funds. UU’s poundm will be invested in centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automation , the Graduate Entry Medical Schooland Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence . Foyle Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson has welcomed Finance Minister Conor Murphy’s support for Executive funding towards Derry’s pound million City Deal and Inclusive Future Fund. She said: “Together, The City Deal and Inclusive Future Fund represent a pound million investment in the North West which will provide a major and much-needed economic boost to the entire region, helping us to create and sustain well-paying jobs and opportunities. “Derry’s City Deal was always contingent on the Executive match funding the British Government’s contribution, but the Executive must also decide whether to take a similar approach to the Future Fund. “Therefore, I very much welcome that Sinn Feacutein Finance Minister Conor Murphy has now confirmed in an Assembly answer to me that he supports match-funding both and will shortly be bringing the matter to the Executive. “That is another example of the positive approach that Sinn Feacutein takes to government, helping to deliver investment, regeneration and opportunity where it is needed.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin was speaking after details were published of locations visited by potential inward investors to Northern Ireland hosted by Invest NI. In the   year, there were  visitsto Belfast, compared to just sixin the Foyle constituency and a meagre two visits in East Derry. Invest NI is Northern Irelands regional economic development agency. It is a non-departmental public body of the Department for the Economy . googletag.cmd.push According to its own website its role is to grow the local economy. “We do this by helping new and existing businesses to compete internationally, and by attracting new investment to Northern Ireland,” it adds. The agency has come in for harsh criticism from Derry representatives in recent weeks after attending a Derry City  Strabane District Council meeting where it was branded “Invest Belfast” and taken to task for failing to promote the North West to potential investors. Just days later, at a Department for the Economy Committee meeting with Invest NI, DUP MLA Christopher Stalford accused Sinead McLaughlin of engaging in the “politics of envy” when she insisted that a sub-regional strategy was needed to address “disparities” across the country. googletag.cmd.push Following the publication of statistics that show almost % of Invest NI visits are to Belfast locations, SDLP Economy Spokesperson Sinead McLaughlin MLA has sought an urgent meeting with Diane Dodds, Economy Minister. The Foyle MLA said: “The focus on Belfast from Invest NI will not be a surprise to many, but the statistics released recently are particularly damning, with almost % of potential investor visits limited to Belfast. “These statistics are only confirmation of what we already know and understand about where investment goes. “It is their mantra that they do not promote one place more over another. If Foreign Direct Investorsland in Belfast and are not taken anywhere  then it is indicative of only promoting one place.”  Skills deficit  Northern Ireland’s skills deficit, she says, is closely linked to its geography, with the strongest skills based in and around Belfast – whereas areas West of the Bann have some of the highest proportions of adults with no qualications, analysis of an NI Assembly briefing document has shown. Almost half the adult population of West Tyrone – % - have no qualications. Other areas with a high proportion of adults without qualications at level  or above include Mid-Ulster , Fermanagh and South Tyrone , Upper Bann , and Newry and Armagh . The Foyle MLA went on to say that sub-regional targets must be written into law and incentives put in place to ensure that investment is spread across the country. “If we keep on doing what we are doing we are going to get the same results, it is fundamentally wrong. People can’t keep on using the same old excuses for regional disparities. “Northern Ireland’s skills deficit is closely linked to its geography, with the strongest skills based in and around Belfast – while the areas West of the Bann have some of the highest proportions of adults with no qualications, analysis of official statistics reveals. “I have written to Minister Dodds to seek an urgent meeting where I will press for inclusion of sub regional investment targets in the new Economy Strategy.” Meanwhile, Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson asked the Minister for the Economy whether she plans to set targets for Invest NI to ensure future jobs are located in Foyle. Diane Dodds, DUP MLA, said: “All targets within the extant Invest NI Business Strategy - are on a regional i.e. Northern Ireland wide basis. “Invest NI supports Councils to drive economic development in their area. Each Council has its own Community Plan, with targets for investment and growth. “Derry City and Strabane District Council has set a target of , jobs by . Invest NI’s support for businesses in the region will contribute towards this.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sister Clare Crockett was a self-confessed party girl with a promising showbusiness career in front of her but she turned her back on fame to follow God when she joined the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother at just . Since her tragic death at just , many miracles have been attributed to her intercession. Clare grew up in Derrys Brandywell and was a popular and outgoing girl who and dreamed of being famous. googletag.cmd.push By her late teens, she had secured an agent and was on the verge a successful acting career, but like many girls her age she spent her weekends drinking in pubs and clubs. She wasnt a bit religious growing up, her sister, Shauna Gill, remembered. We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

Ryan McGeough was coached by Gregg at Portstewart FC for three or four years as a teenager. “My mum texted me about his death and I couldnt believe it,” McGeough said. “I hadnt seen him in a few years and I would have loved to run into him and have a yarn but unfortunately I never got the chance.” Gregg, who was voted as the best goalkeeper of the  World Cup, a native of Tobermore, passed away at the age of  and aside from his talents between the posts he was most famous in football circles for his heroics during the Munich air disaster in February  which claimed the lives of  people. googletag.cmd.push Harry pulled some of his team-mates from the burning plane, after disaster struck on theirjourney from a European Cup victory over Red Star Belgrade. Among those he saved were Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and manager Sir Matt Busby. Harry played  games but was a larger than le presence. Anybody who ever had a conversation with Harry would have remembered it,” stated Irish FA Chief Executive Patrick Nelson in a statement to the County Derry Post. Gregg started his club career with Windsor Park Swts, the reserve team of Linfield, before signing for his local club Coleraine. At the age of  he earned a move to Second Division side Doncaster Rovers before switching to Manchester United for pound,, which was a world record fee for a goalkeeper at the time and made  appearances for the Red Devils. googletag.cmd.push He entered management and became manager of Shrewsbury Town, before taking charge of Swansea City, Crewe Alexandra and Carlisle United. Gregg also had a spell as goalkeeping coach at Manchester United and as assistant manager at Swindon Town. Harry was appointed an MBE by The Queen in  for services to football, and was then made an OBE in , also for services to football. Each week the Harry Gregg Foundation facilitates a wide range of activities for thousands of people in the Coleraine area and beyond through participation in football and ious other activities. Sir Alex Ferguson, who took his United team to play in Harrys testimonial in Belfast in , paid a tribute on Manchester Uniteds Official Website. “Harry was a man of great character and a true legend at our club. I remember that he was always very excited and proud to host our youth team at his boarding house for the Milk Cup every summer, so he could recount the tales of his playing days. I loved his company and the many pieces of advice he gave me.” While back in Ireland, Gregg bought the Windsor Hotel in Portstewart and began coaching the local soccer team. One player who remembers him fondly was goalkeeper Ryan McGeough who would go on to win two Derry championship medals with Coleraine GAA team. GREGG THE COACH “He was thecoach but as a goalkeeper you got a lot more attention from him than everybody. He was the first goalkeeper coach I ever came across that made the goalkeepers train with the outfielders. “Ray Woods was an England capped goalkeeper whenUnited won the league in   and they bought Harry for a record fee. “Harry said to me the only reason why they bought him was that Woods was a linie,” recalls McGeough, referring to Woods reluctance to leave his six-yard box. “Harry was the first goalkeeper to sweep outside his box and cover for defenders. He would always have had you out in the box organising your defenders.” McGeough soon learned Greggs approach to goalkeeping during one of those coaching sessions with Portstewart. “Peter Schmeichel was my hero and having played European handball, he brought in the spreading himself”, McGeough continues, explaining the Danes trademark star-jump, making himself as imposing as possible. Harry Gregg didnt agree and stopped his young proteacutegeacute advancing a la Schmeichel during training.   It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. Ryan McGeough  “He dropped the ball and said you, e on it and you , challenge him. If you do the spread again, you will do this all night. In Harrys era, you ed and took the ball and man. “It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. I havent spread myself since in case Harry was watching,” laughs the affable McGeough. “He would have taken it as serious coaching a  year old as a senior.” “He taught you how to manipulate forwards on a one on one and force the forward to make the first move. What he was teaching was far and beyond seen before. “If another manager, who is not a goalkeeper, says something to you, you could question it butHarry said something to you - you just did it. “Wed sit around the changing room listening to him for an hour and a half after training. Hed be telling us stories about Best, Charlton and Busby. When you are a big Man Utd head, you are in dreamland listening to him.” McGeough speaks of how goalkeeping has changed and in the era of televised games too much of the routines being similar. “In Harrys day there were so many dferent styles and I would prefer to play the way Harry played.” READ ALSO - He was larger than le on the pitch.

His performance will give manager Declan Devine something to think about ahead of this week’s game against Waterford, and Mallon admitted that the opportunity to prove himself on the pitch drives him every day.“In the first game I didn’t start but I kept my head,” he explained. “I’ve had times before, playing Us, when I haven’t been picked and I’ve thrown my head, but tonight was a chance to prove that I’ve changed and I’ve matured and that I am going to work hard every day. Decky put his faith in me and the goal was an unbelievable feeling.”Mallon was a threat for Derry City throughout Friday’s game and was involved in a fascinating battle with Bohs defender Michael Barker, a battle he eventually won.“I play to my strengths, I get the ball and knock it down the line and use my pace and get crosses in,” he explained. “I think he started to read that and that’s why, on the goal, I came inside to go back out. “It was an unbelievable feeling running over to the fans in the corner. My body was numb, it was an unreal feeling and to have my family in that corner as well was unbelievable.”The importance of getting the first win of the season was not lost on anyone at the club, but Mallon insists that neither he nor his team mates are getting carried away.“We’ve had two hard games,” he acknowledged. “We went to Dundalk and put in a good performance and were unlucky and Finn Harps I think we could have come away from that game with two more points, but it’s moments like this when you have to dig deep and keep on going. We always thought we could win this game, but it is only one game. We have four points on the board and we go into next week with the same attitude because we want to get another three points and get to the top end of the table.“The next game is a big game so hopefully we can go down there, give % and come away with the three points. googletag.cmd.push ‘No pats on the back’Meanwhile, Declan Devine has got one of his pre-season wishes as his team beat one of the top three at last, but he is not celebrating too much.“I want to beat them again,” he stated. “There’s no pats on the back. We’ve done it once, we have to play them another three times, we have to play Dundalk another three times and we have to play Shamrock Rovers four times. “It’s a good start doing that but for me this was all about character. “The boys took a few digs last week, with a few people saying things that I felt hard done by, but that’s the nature of it. We have to remember that when we came into this club they were th in the league having lost  league games, the crowds were down to - people. “People quickly forget, but we have to understand that this is the nature of the job. “The support we received was honestly unreal the singing and the backing the players received, that’s everything, that was important as the performance on the pitch.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry City were left frustrated against Bohs continuously last season, picking up three points from four games against the Dubliners, with just one goal scored in the process. City have matched that points tally and bettered their goalalready and Devine insisted the points went to the better team.“Bohs are a very good side and let’s be honest, they’ve played three games in a week and we’ve played two and that’s not taking away anything from us,” he said. “Fair play to them, they came here and had a right good go, but I thought we were the dominant side, thought we were very much the team in control of the game and I think the players deserve huge credit again because they showed brilliant character and a desire to win the match.”The Candystripes are making a habit of scoring late goals, with Adam Liddle’s th minute goal against Finn Harps last week followed by Figueira’s nd minute strike on Friday. Derry City just keep going…“We have to. We have to,” Devine insisted. “The game lasts that long. These players worked extremely hard in pre-season and their fitness levels are really high. “The importance of the squad was shown again in the three guys who came on and had a huge impact. “We have a lot of talented players but we have to fight and scrap for every point we earn in this league. It is a tough league, an unforgiving league and we have got to play when we have got the ball and dig deep when we don’t. All in all it was a good night but we have to try and get better and keep moving forward and keep having that same appetite every Friday night we play.” googletag.cmd.push Key MomentDanny Lupano’s acrobatic goal-line clearance was a key moment in the game, and played a pivotal part in City securing their first clean sheet of the season. “It was a key moment but there were a lot of key moments,” Devine stated. “We had a couple of free headers Ally has a free header, Eoin Toal has a free header, so it works both ways. Our own downfall was giving the chance away that Danny has cleared, and what a clearance. Character is everything, quality is everything and an ability for people to attack and run to the very end the players deserve huge credit for. “There were a lot of square pegs in round holes but ultimately we have done a job and that’s all it is. “The players have been magnicent, I keep saying that, and they have been since January . “They will continue to get better andthey keep showing the appetite and hunger then that’s all I can ask for.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, McKnight was not to be denied and in the seventh minute he dispossessed Corey Laverty and hit a shot that squirmed through Leneghanrsquos hands and into the net.Albion had barely time to celebrate as, virtually from the restart, Tollymore won a free kick that was delivered into the box, by McLister, for Ruairi Toner to shoot into the net.United slowly began to take a stranglehold in midfield with Marty McCourt and Tommy Kane dominating Burke and Rooney. On the left wing, Marty Devlin was giving the Albion defence a torrid time with his pace and power.Just on the stroke of half-time Albionrsquos Ryan Beckett fired a free kick over the Bearsrsquo crossbar.Despite having wind advantage, Tollymore were unable to create any chances of note and they were rocked in the th minute when Albion centre half Allan Cousins found himself unmarked in the Tollymore area to head a corner kick past Leneghan.Despite this setback, Tollymore held their nerve and Jack McCourt and Matt McCormick linked up for McCourt to run through on goal. Unfortunately, Albion lsquokeeper Joel Collins made a superb finger tip save to block McCourtrsquos shot.United were well on top, but were lacking the guile to open up the Moira defence until the introduction of veteran striker Adrian lsquoSparkyrsquo Howard.Within moments of Howardrsquos arrival in the st minute he got on the end of a McLister flick to shoot past Collins in the Albion goal.It was now all Tollymore as the Bears pushed for a winner and Albion were reduced to ten-men after Darryl Irwin was dismissed for a cynical foul on Marty Devlin as the striker burst through on goal, after being put clear by Tommy Kane.Virtually on the stroke of full time, Corey Laverty picked out Howard with a superb pass only for Collins to make another excellent save. Extra time saw Tollymore playing with the wind and forcing a succession of corners that Albion did well to defend.Albion seemed content to play for penalty kicks and it was only in the last couple of minutes of the game that they came out of their defensive shell, but were unable to penetrate a resolute Tollymore defence.Albion netted their first penalty with Marty McCourt equalising and then the fun started. Leneghan saved the second spot kick and Albionrsquos Joel Collins then blocked Corey Lavertyrsquos effort to keep things level at -. Leneghan then saved the third Albion kick before Marty Devlin scored to nudge the Bears in front at -.The Moira men levelled things with a cracking penalty leaving United with two more penalties to win. Unfortunately, Howard shot wide to leave the scores - and one penalty apiece left.Once again Leneghan made an unbelievable save to hand the initiative to United and Adam Rea stepped up to blast the ball into the net to send United into the final.Match sponsor: Diamond Pats, Newcastle.Tollymore United Moira Albion MID ULSTER LEAGUE CUP S

South Down MP Chris Hazzard during a meeting in Berlin last weekend with representatives from the Executive Board of the European Left.The MP was warmly received by delegates from the EU member states who congratulated Mr Hazzard on Sinn Feinrsquos recent success in the Irish election.Mr Hazzard said that it was ldquofantastic to receive a warm welcome from representatives of the European Left.He explained that throughout the Brexit negotiations, European solidarity with Ireland was ldquoremarkable and it was fitting that he had the opportunity to thank representatives from across the EU for that support at their Executive Board meeting.Mr Hazzard said that it was also important to take the opportunity to call for continued support in the months ahead.ldquoBrexit is by no means complete and Ireland will need ongoing solidarity as European and British government officials commence trade talks next month, the MP continued.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the British government to adopt a casual approach to their international obligations and responsibilities to protect both the Good Friday Agreement and our all-Ireland economy.Mr Hazzard revealed that it was also ldquofascinating to be involved in a discussion regarding the need to deepen understanding and relations with all European Left parties in the time ahead, especially in relation to tackling the climate emergency, workersrsquo rights, gender equality and the increasing need to counter the growth in extreme, far-right politics throughout Europe.Also this week, the South Down MP described British government immigration proposals as ldquounpopular, unworkable and a direct threat to economic well-being in South Down.Responding to proposals confirmed by the Home Office that immigration policy in Northern Ireland will change from next year, the MP warned that far from strengthening the economic wellbeing of society, the proposals are a direct threat to the local hospitality, tourism, retail and agri-food sectors.Mr Hazzard declared: ldquoIt is hard not to view these proposals as an elitist, xenophobic attack on overseas and low-paid workers, the vast majority of whom we simply cannot live without.ldquoIndeed, most worryingly, these proposals are a cruel attack on our care sector the wonderful, selfless heroes whom we all rely on to take care of us and our families in our hour of need.Mr Hazzard said it is ldquoabundantly clear that the Home Office has completely ignored what he described as the ldquoNorthrsquos unique and special circumstances and has shown nothing but contempt for local business and industry leaders who have engaged constructively with British government officials in recent years.The MP added: ldquoSinn Feacutein will be raising these concerns directly with the British government in the weeks to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down District has two of worst roads in NI  ","story":"TWO of the worst roads in Northern Ireland are in Down District and just miles apart, it has been revealed.They are the Shore Road in Strangford and the Blackstaff Road in Clough which are placed first and third respectively in the list of the provincersquos worst roads, the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed.New statistics revealed by the government department confirm that a total of  defects mdash including pot holes mdash were recorded on both roads last year.Government officials say that  defects were recorded on the Shore Road and  on the Blackstaff Road.The Department has confirmed that between  and  it paid out a staggering pound.m to drivers across Northern Ireland whose vehicles had been damaged by potholes.Years of underinvestment has led to a deterioration of Northern Irelandrsquos roads according to Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, who is making poundm available to help address the issue.The cash will also be used for winter gritting services and to help repair the tens of thousands of street lights that are out across the country.Ms Mallon explained that years of underinvestment as well as the impact of severe winter weather has led to deterioration in the road network and in recent years this has impacted on the level of vehicle damage compensation payments.Last year, Northern Irelandrsquos public spending watchdog warned that it would cost more than poundbn to deal with structural maintenance.The Northern Ireland Audit Office published a report highlighting how a lack of investment was having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Irelandrsquos road network and found that a lack of funding had led to a signicant reduction in the number of potholes being recorded and approved for repair.Ms Mallon said that ldquofrustratingly for a number of years now not enough money had been allocated to her departmentrsquos budget to maintain roads and repairs were having to be done on a priority basis.ldquoWhile I have inherited severe and challenging budget constraints, I am committed to finding solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives, she said.ldquoI have impressed on the new finance minister the need for additional money to deal with this issue and other critical pressures. Sustainable infrastructure is key to improving lives and connecting communities.Confirmation of the poundm funding package to deal with roads maintenance, winter gritting and defective street lights comes just weeks after the Recorder revealed that while the lights were back on at Stormont after MLAs ed to work, they were continuing to go out across the district at an alarming rate.In mid-January, almost  street lights were not working in East Down, plunging many areas into darkness and the Department for Infrastructure confirming that due to budgetary pressures it was only able to provide a limited repair service.Province-wide, it was estimated that in excess of , street lights were not working with the government department having only a small number of engineers at its disposal to repair all of them.Downpatrick topped the league table for broken street lights in East Down with  in need of repair. Newcastle was in second place with  street lights not working.Other district hot spots included Ballynahinch where  street lights were out of order, while where,  faults were reported in Killyleagh,  in Castlewellan and Crossgar and  in Saintfield.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has welcomed the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to invest poundm and hopes that many of the potholes and defective street lights across the district will be repaired.He said while the defects will be repaired according to their priority, he hopes that Ms Mallon will secure additional support from the Stormont Executive to carry out a full repair programme.ldquoThe minister is having to deal with a legacy of under investment in the roads network and she must be given every assistance by her Stormont colleagues. There are clearly budgetary pressures across a range of departments but it is is vital that we invest in our roads and wastewater infrastructure in particular, continued Cllr Curran.ldquoMs Mallon clearly has the needs of people at heart and hopefully she will be given additional monies to help address the particular problems we have in Down District. It is important that all road repairs are carried out to a high standard to that the work will last..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down GAA.jpg","title":"Down goals revive hopes  ","story":"DOWN left it late before getting the better of Longford at a bitterly cold Pairc Esler on Saturday night.Itrsquos ever so tight now in the race for second place behind an unbeaten Cork in the Division  table with Down, Longford, Derry and Offaly all on five points after four games.Saturdayrsquos game seemed to be heading for a draw as the sides were locked at - to - with less than  minutes remaining.However, two late goals from Cory Quinn and James Guinness put paid to a brave Longford challenge as Down ran out two point winners.Longford were dealt a blow before the game with star forward Rian Brady ruled out with a chest infection and his replacement, Peter Lynn, who scored two points in the early exchanges, had to go off injured after  minutes.It was Lynn who opened the scoring in the first minute, but Downrsquos fleet-footed set of forwards quickly got into gear and created scores for Barryand Darren OrsquoHagan before Liam Connerton brought the sides level again in the sixth minute.Cory Quinn and Lynn swapped scores as did Jonny Flynn and Darren Gallagher to leave the sides in deadlock at - apiece after  minutes.Flynn and Donal OrsquoHare then edged Down two clear as the first half headed for conclusion, but a total of six points were scored in added time.Gallagher and a rsquo from lsquokeeper Paddy Collum made it - apiece, but Kevin McKernan pointed Down back into the lead.

In these opening minutes, BRA did enjoy a sustained period of play in Down High territory, but the home town defence was watertight.Back at the other end Ben Gibson was unlucky not to get points when he was adjudged to have been held up over the line after a period of play close the BRA line.Finally, around  minutes into the half, the pressure turned into points with Joe Charles driving over from short range for an unconverted try.It was the second half before Down High added to their tally. This time the pack provided the  with a very convincing driven maul.Having driven towards the BRA line at great pace, the referee felt the BRA infringement to stop the maul was so stark that he marched under the posts, awarding Down a penalty try to take the score line to -.With a reasonable buffer, the local lads did lt their foot a little off the gas.A few BRA replacements made a big impact and in a relatively short space of time the North Belfast outfit had scored two converted tries, giving them a - lead.With  minutes to go, Down, now chasing the game, had to produce something special. And that they did.Winger Jonathan Graham was the player to touch down, reaching out to score on the back of some great work in the maul by the dominant Down pack.The conversion attempt from out wide fell short leaving Down with a slender - lead and around six minutes of play left.The closing exchanges were tense with BRA making their way into Down territory on a few occasions, but a few vital pieces of defensive play saved the day, one of these being a crucial turnover from replacement David Corrie.The refereersquos final whistle on the back of a BRA knock-on was greatly welcomed by the large home support.Down have now drawn Bangor Grammar in the semi-finals mdash a side they have both beaten and lost to earlier in the season.Down High School Belfast Royal Academy SUBSIDIARY SHIELD Q FINAL.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Legislation.jpg","title":"Legislation welcomed on review of road running  ","story":"A REVIEW of controversial legislation governing road running events has been welcomed by two local politicians.The Department of Infrastructure is to review new rules which place a financial hurdle in the way of running and other sports clubs organising events on public roads which have to be closed, hitting them in the pocket.The new legislation governing the administration work associated with road closures to allow events to take place in safety left organisers potentially paying as much as pound,, but local politicians worked with Newry, Mourne and Down Council in a bid to keep costs to a minimum.Road closure orders for events were previously free, but the new legislation removed this concession and in addition to impacting on running and sports clubs, the new law also applies to community groups organising fun days which require a section of road to be closed.The government departmentrsquos review of the new legislation has been welcomed by South Down MLA Emma Rogan and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.Ms Rogan said the legislation placed a ldquodisproportionate financial burden on road running events while Cllr Devlin hoped the review agreed by Stormont minister Nichola Mallon will lead to ldquopositive change.Ms Rogan said the new law on road closures meant that a number of road running events cannot keep up with the costs of traffic management.ldquoFewer events are applying for closure permits as a result of this change and, most recently, this affected the Dark Hedges half marathon in Antrim, she explained.The MLA added: ldquoMy Sinn Fein colleagues on the Stormont Infrastructure Committee raised the need for the legislation to be amended so this burden can be lted from organisers, particularly those of smaller events.ldquoThis one size fits all approach for road racing traffic management is impacting on local communities. I welcome a review initiated by the government department to look at the impact of this legislation which needs to be amended so many local events can thrive once again.Cllr Devlin said while there were many positive aspects of the new legislation, such as providing a framework to ensure special events can be held on roads safely and legally, there were a number which have caused great dficulty to charities, running clubs and other groups doing vital work in the community.ldquoWhen this legislation was introduced by a previous minister there was uproar among local community groups, football and running clubs as well as charities who all hosted small road races to raise vital funds for their own causes, she explained.ldquoThis legislation represents another layer of red tape and, for many, resulted in them ceasing such events which was very disappointing for all involved.Cllr Devlin explained that while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos policy was amended to accommodate local not-for-profit groups, the Stormont legislation remained ldquoflawed.She continued: ldquoI welcome that Minister Mallon has confirmed that she is aware of the concerns around the legislation mdash introduced before her time in office mdash and has committed to reviewing it. This common-sense approach is very welcome.ldquoThe government department has confirmed that the review will commence in the coming months, with Ms Mallon seeking views and asking stakeholders to engage with the process.

However, the securing and locating of a temporary mobile facility for the short-term was welcome.Mr McGrath said that while the building was able to use a generator provided by the contractor for the switching-on of a sustainable Christmas tree provided by the council, the generator did not remain in place.He continued: ldquoI have contacted council and made representations and have been told the relevant committee has discussed and approved the long-term use of a generator which will allow activities to commence soon. This is welcome but not ideal.ldquoApparently, there are some dficulties with the Ministry of Defence in securing the correct wayleave permission toenable electricity to be brought to the building. I have written to the Ministry and to the Northern Ireland Office and asked that this situation be sorted immediately.He urged: ldquoThe community must have its proper facility and it must be able to open properly.ldquoI hope the administrative issues can be sorted and this matter brought to a swt conclusion the community enabled to have the centre it has desperately wanted and needed for so long.The MoD last week indicated its willingness to work with NIE Networks to reach an agreement.A spokesman said: ldquoWe continue to work with Northern Ireland Electricity Networks on the installation of a power supply for the community centre.ldquoThe MOD has a long relationship with the Ballykinlar area and is pleased to support the development of this centre.A spokesman for NIE Networks outlined the connection process and said that once payment had been received by the council last October, it proceeded to undertake a site inspection and started land ownership investigations.The spokesperson added: ldquoOnce we identied the owner of the land a wayleave agreement request was issued and the process is moving forward as normal. Once the wayleave agreement is in place, work to install the connection will begin.A council spokesman said: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down District Council is unable to comment on the discussions between NIE and the Ministry of Defence, but will continue to liaise with both parties to progress the completion of Ballykinlar Community Centre.ldquoRegarding a temporary supply of electricity, the council is exploring a range of temporary options to supply electricity to the centre and cannot provide a timescale at present..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Patrick.jpg","title":"Patrick leads Newcastle team to victory  ","story":"NEWCASTLE AC are the new undisputed NI and Ulster senior cross-country champions.The race ed to Ulster University at Coleraine for the first time in several years on Saturday and Newcastle AC secured the title for the second grime in five years.The club won the title back in  and they were intent on stopping City of Derry from winning for the fourth year in a row.This year again the bus of lsquomaybesrsquo turned into a bus of lsquodefinitesrsquo and  runners and lsquoone hanger onrsquo set off for the north coast, or at least almost to the north coast in typical February wintry conditions.First up were the three women who travelled and it was such a shame that there wasnrsquot a fourth runner, for surely the women would have been destined for senior team medalsthey could only have found one more volunteer con.Shalene McMurray is notorious for her fast starts, but she settled in sensibly into the pack early on.The women had three times of the k lap that included a bit of climbing along with mud, mud and more mud mdash hardly any firm going on the course at all plus a gale that would cut anyone in two mdash tough conditions where only the tough would prevail.Emma Mitchell, these days running for Clonlfe Harriers, pulled away and won with relative ease in :.

So extraordinary in fact that it is well within the bounds of possibility and in-built polling error that another election would see Sinn Fein not only confirm its present position as the largest party in the Republic, but maybe also larger than Fianna Fail and Fine Gael combined. And that’s the kind of outcome which should make Micheál Martin and Leo Varadkar very keen to avoid another election.Sinn Fein’s latest rise in the pollsmay also make Martin and Varadkar wary of cutting what I’ve previously described as an ‘ourselves together’ deal that excludes Sinn Fein. Any hint of even modest growth for Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, or something that could be interpreted as a public backlash against the prospect of Sinn Fein in government, might have emboldened the other two leaders to concoct something similar to their confidence and supply arrangement in . But the poll suggests no evidence of that, so anything that looks like a self-serving plan to marginalise the most popular party and most popular leader is likely to backfire.Mary Lou McDonald helps Dessie Ellis TD celebrate his election. \"Its not that people in the Republic don’t care about the IRA, its that they don’t link it to her\" \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...It’s also worth noting that the constant reminders of the Sinn Fein IRA linksseem to have done nothing to instil caution in the electorate. It’s not, I think, the case that people in the Republic don’t care about the IRA and the personal pasts of some key players in Sinn Fein, it’s just that they don’t continue the link through to Mary Lou McDonald. Gerry Adams clearly presented a problem for some voters. She doesn’t. Indeed, it seems clear that people who once voted for other parties are now prepared to vote for Sinn Fein which mirrors what we saw happen in Northern Ireland, a process which John Humedescribed as SDLP lending votes to Sinn Fein for the sake of peace. Yet within five years those lent votes had become part of Sinn Fein’s core vote.In my News Letter column on February , a few days before the election and discussing the possible outcomes, I noted: ‘There is still a very signicant distrust of Sinn Fein within Ireland’s political establishment. Am I suggesting that a Fianna Fail Sinn Fein deal is inevitable  ‘No. But I am suggesting that the possibility of such a deal might be greater than most observers think.’My gut instinct then – and it hasn’t changed – is that Micheál Martin was desperate to be Taoiseach and would, consequently, consider all options .It is still Martin who has the biggest call to make at this point. This is probably his last opportunity to become Taoiseach andhe fails he will be the only leader of Fianna Failnever to have been elected Taoiseach.A deal with Fine Gael, which excludes Sinn Fein, could do more long term electoral damage to his party than to either Sinn Fein or Fine Gael, meaning it becomes a very risky strategy. A second election doesn’t seem to hold much prospect of racing ahead of Sinn Fein, which means he would be booted from the leadership. Anyway, a deal with a party which failed to renew or increase its mandate after four years in government smacks of desperation the sort of desperation which makes stability dficult. Bringing Sinn Fein into government with himraises all sorts of problems for him and his party, but at least it allows him to become Taoiseach and, although nothing is certain in politics nowadays, make it slightly easier to build a reasonably stable government. There might even be subsequent brownie points from voters for proving that he wasn’t afraid to listen to an important new element in the electorateand make dficult decisions.A Fianna Fail Fine Gael coalition does look like the easier option for him but, as I say, the long term consequences might do him no favours. One thing he will have noted from what’s been happening in Northern Ireland since the mid-s is that efforts to exclude or marginalise Sinn Fein singularly failed to halt the growth of the party. The same sort of thing seems to be happening in the Republic. Which leads to all sorts of questions for the political establishment, not least of which is, why is a party with Sinn Fein’s background, links with the IRA and hard-left policies, doing so well and outpolling Fianna Fail and Fine Gael  Let me offer a note of caution to my political audience in the Republicdon’t make the mistake of assuming that Sinn Fein’s success is entirely down to presenting themselves as a socio economic alternative to the Fianna Fail Fine Gael ‘establishment’. It runs much, much deeper than that. The party has tapped into something , a desire for political electoral change,you like, that the other parties haven’t fully appreciated. There are clearly a number of routes to keep Sinn Fein out of government, but it’s beginning to look like those options would actually be of enormous political and electoral benefit to the party.The old establishment needs to tread with enormous cautionit hopes to survive this present crisis.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I have also recently received a number of correspondence cases drawing my attention to serious concerns regarding the financial viability of the council, and asking for my intervention.”DUP councillor John McAuley said: “It appears to be a quite in-depth list of questions, covering a broad spectrum. “The council have responded and there are a considerable number of documents, including minutes of meetings and other kind of records.”He added: “I would welcome the co-operation of the council and this is a step in the right direction, I would hope, to restoring the public’s confidence in the council.”Independent councillor Padraig McShane said: “It is inconceivable that the department would intervene in the running of a council in ordinary circumstances.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
