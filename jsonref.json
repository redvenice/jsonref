Unlike cows or pigs, insects can be bred in significant numbers without taking up large amounts of land, water or feed.According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, at least 2 billion people, particularly in Asian countries such as Thailand and Vietnam, already regularly consume insects, which are seen as a way of helping to feed the world’s growing population.The Barclays report cites sushi as an example of a food that was once considered a novelty in the west but has gained mainstream acceptance after trickling down from high-end restaurants to supermarket shelves. Members of Generation Z, with their heightened focus on health and sustainability matters, are the “most likely to overcome the ‘yuck factor’ associated with consuming insects”, it adds.The big supermarkets are already testing consumers’ appetite with bug-based snacks and staples such as pasta, flour and cereal. The European supermarket group Carrefour entered the fray last year with a range that included buffalo worm pasta and granola in its Spanish stores, while Sainsbury’s and Ocado sell bags of roasted crickets made by the London food company Eat Grub.Eat Grub’s co-founder Shami Radia said the five-year-old business, which also sells insect-based energy bars and protein powders, had just secured its biggest order to date, with the German discounter Lidl, which will stock its roasted crickets in 3,200 of its domestic stores.“We thought our protein bars would be the most popular but our crickets have been a surprise as Sainsbury’s has helped make them more mainstream,” said Radia, who believes attitudes to eating insects have started to change. “Press coverage used to describe insects within the context of bushtucker trials but now they are talked about as the food of the future. A lot of our customers are meat eaters who want to cut down on their meat consumption but don’t want to be vegetarian or vegan.”He said that while crickets had a growing following, turning shoppers on to the charms of buffalo worms – a “fantastic addition” to a smoothie or a flapjack, according to the Eat Grub website – and mealworms (great for roasting and sprinkling on soups) was more difficult because of the word “worm”.But it is not just squeamishness that is putting some consumers off, with analysts pointing to prices that are out of kilter with comparable snacks. This has started to change as the market grows in scale and yields improve. Ÿnsect, a French mealworm producer, is planning to build the world’s largest insect farm in Amiens, northern France.Morrison said: “The prices for different products do vary, but generally prices remain relatively high. The ability to automate the insect-farming process will enable supply to increase and prices to become more competitive with meat and plant-based alternatives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9380bc5bc31d0d57733393c0af753fd8baacfb1e/0_99_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84171c434461a0fca37230b550344819","title":"no deal brexit cost uk car manufacturing extra 70m day","story":"UK ambassador says Berlin is willing to hear fresh ideas for Irish border problemGermany will fight to the last hour to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal and is willing to hear any fresh ideas for the Irish border backstop, the country’s ambassador to the UK has said.Speaking at a car manufacturers’ summit in London, Peter Wittig said Germany cherished its relationship with the UK and was ready to talk about solutions the new prime minister might have for the Irish border problem.“It’s a mindset. We are not giving up in achieving an orderly Brexit. Germany has been a very pragmatic voice in this whole tortuous Brexit process and we will continue to be that.“Even if we have a short window while the new prime minister is in place, we will welcome any idea how to solve that famous backstop issue and we will be willing to work towards a negotiated deal which is long term the only viable and sensible option for Europe,” he added.“Our mindset is to explore all pathways to come to a negotiated deal.”The German envoy’s comments came as motor industry leaders warned that the cost of car manufacturing would go up £70m a day if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, making the British automotive industry more vulnerable to closures,.They also warned for the second time this year that car prices will go up by an average of £1,500.“Leaving the EU without a deal would trigger the most seismic shift in trading conditions ever experienced by automotive, with billions of pounds of tariffs threatening to impact consumer choice and affordability,” said the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) at an industry conference in London.“The end to borderless trade could bring crippling disruptions to the industry’s just-in-time operating model. Delays to shipments of parts to production plants are measured in minutes, with every 60 seconds costing £50,000 in gross value added – amounting to some £70m a day in a worst-case scenario,” it added.In a ‘no deal’ scenario, the UK would leave the single market and the customs union immediately with no ‘orce’ arrangement in place. The European Court of Justice would cease to have jurisdiction over the UK, and the country would also leave various other institutions including Euratom and Europol. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment. There would be no transition period. Free movement of people into the UK from the EU27 would stop.Trade between the UK and the EU would be governed by basic WTO rules. The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports - making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO ‘most favoured nation’ rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods - they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some ‘No Deal’ supporters have claimed that the UK can use Article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to ten years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement (FTA) is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke Article 24 unilaterally - the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.Until some agreements are in place, a ‘no deal’ scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses - for example the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a ‘managed’ no deal envisage that a range of smaller sector-by-sector bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.In a report, the SMMT said the imposition of tariffs for trade in passenger cars along would be £4.5bn, a “knockout blow” to the sector’s competitiveness.The industry has already lost two big names in the past year with the closure of Honda in Swindon in 2021 and the axing of the Ford plant in Bridgend in Wales with the loss of thousands of jobs.While neither Honda nor Ford cited Brexit as a cause, the industry fears Britain’s competitiveness and unstable political environment will deter future investment by global car manufacturers.Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: “We are already seeing investment stall. As a manufacturer you constantly invest in machinery to make sure you are more efficient, make sure you are competitive.“When the big investment decisions come with a new model, that’s when you are competing with other plants, that’s when you need to be at your most efficient and if in the previous two or three years you have underinvested it makes it much harder.”Few car companies want to go public on their fears over Brexit because of the backlash in the media and some political interests, sources say.Hawes said the analysis of tariffs was based on facts, on industry and government data and warned that his pleas were not fearmongering.“We are not making claims that the entire industry will close doors overnight, this industry is adaptable and agile, but it can only do so much if the barriers are particularly high,” he said.He warned the industry would decline with a “death by a thousand cuts”.The car industry has little to no warehousing capacity to stockpile in the event of no deal with production based on just-in-time and just-in-sequence systems.“We have 1,100 vehicles a day coming into the UK with parts, components, we need them to move seamlessly. If we have delivery delays, that means production stops,” he said.Some component manufacturers have also been hit by the Brexit uncertainty, Hawes said, including one company in south Wales."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4293a404318da2bb323cbe3797eb684f427d49d1/231_759_2843_1706/master/2843.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49bf971202b8ea8baca7c2eeb8d8d808","title":"uk council ikea affordable housing worthing boklok","story":"Worthing council gives go ahead for 162 flats by retailer’s joint venture with construction firm SkanskaHomebuyers in a town where properties typically cost almost 12 times local salaries may soon have a low-cost option from Ikea after a UK council agreed to work with an affordable housing developer co-owned by the retailer.Worthing council has signed up with BoKlok, a company jointly owned by the Swedish retailer and construction firm Skanska which specialises in factory-built housing that can be constructed at a low cost.The firm sets property prices so that buyers have money left to live on after they have paid their housing costs, and its website says “a single parent can afford to buy and live in a newly built two-bedroom BoKlok apartment”.It has built 11,000 homes across Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway, and is keen to break into the UK after a false start more than a decade ago.Previous plans for a development in Tyneside were scaled back when the financial crisis hit, but its latest effort is a collaboration with Worthing council, which believes it can achieve more affordable homes through the deal than if it sells the land to a conventional developer.Councillors in the coastal town have voted to work on a plan that would see 162 flats built on land that it owns.The latest data from the Office for National Statistics showed that in 2018 average house prices in Worthing were 11.7 times average salaries, compared with a figure of 7.8 times across England and Wales.In a report, the council said that access to homes was challenging for those on the average salary, which was £25,458 in 2015 – with only one-bedroom properties within reach, it noted.Under the plans the council will license the developer to use the land rather than selling it off, charging it an annual ground rent.The council, which has more than 1,300 households on its housing waiting list, said its analysis suggested the land could be used for 45 homes with just 13 of them available for affordable rent.The company said it has “scrutinised our costs and trimmed them to the bone,” but there are no compromises on quality.Flooring and wall tiles are included in the price, and homes are fitted with an Ikea kitchen. Worthing council’s plans show-homes that range from one-bedroom apartments measuring 50 sq metres (538sq ft) to three-bedroom apartments of 74 sq metres (800sq ft).Councillor Kevin Jenkins, Worthing borough council’s executive member for regeneration, said: “In this current market it’s extremely tough for local people who are in full-time work to get on the housing market.“This proposal could change that, giving these hard-working iniduals a genuine chance to buy their own home without having to move out of the town.”If the plans go ahead work on the site will begin in September 2020, with the first homes would be delivered and assembled the following January, and ready to move into in April 2021.Further homes may follow, with the council and BoKlok agreeing a programme to provide 500 homes in the borough.The project is one of a range of ways councils are working with developers to create more affordable homes for local people. Croydon council has set up a company called Brick by Brick which is building homes for social rent subsidised by homes sold on the open market."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f857caab081a06e58ebf6bb3cf8028626b4d0934/0_36_2150_1291/master/2150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c259d76acbdcd679aba87e5e82252a29","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of needle","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘needle’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘needle’.Share your photos of what needle means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 26 June at 10am.

This must be a forest school. Or is it?According to academics in a book, Critical Issues in Forest Schools, to be published next month, there is a high probability that it is not a forest school as, it says, large numbers of nurseries, primaries and secondaries are falsely claiming claim to be one.The forest school movement, introduced to the UK about 25 years ago, has taken off in the last decade, partly as an alternative to the formal, test-driven infant and primary curriculum. It is seen as a way of getting children outdoors, in touch with nature and away from their phones and computers.The concept was inherited from Scandinavian outdoor kindergarten lessons and has grown in the UK into a distinct approach to teaching and learning. The lessons are outdoors, usually in wooded areas, and are learner-centred, and play-based.But some schools and nurseries, in both the state and independent sectors, are using the term as a marketing tool. Parents are being misled because the term is being widely used to describe general outdoor “getting muddy” activities, or one-off environmental sessions.The authors of the book, themselves involved in forest schools, say the idea should be about discovery learning over an extended period, with children involved in meaningful and challenging activities. These should entail some risk – lighting fires, or learning to use knives, for example.Taking children outdoors to go pond dipping, or to learn about the Vikings, doesn’t make your school a forest school, says Mark Sackville-Ford, a lecturer in education at Manchester politan University (MMU) and co-editor of the book. “Forest school sets children free to follow their curiosity, it is slightly subversive, an antidote to the results and test-driven classroom,” he says.The book, a collection of papers from academics and teachers, defines the essence of forest schools, the processes by which children learn in the sessions and the challenges for practitioners.Elizabeth Irvin, headteacher of St Mary’s primary in Stockport, which is a forest school, and a contributor to the book, says not all schools are in it for the right reasons. “The saddest comment I heard was by a headteacher who said ‘I can’t afford not to do it because every other school around me is doing it and it looks good on your website’,” she says. At St Mary’s, the principles of forest school are embedded for each year group.Businesses have been set up offering “forest school experiences” and training, claiming they improve pupils’ self-esteem and promote healthier lifestyles. Even companies selling products such as rubber boots and waterproofs are jumping on the bandwagon, with one telling teachers that all they need to do to become a forest school is “simply take your lesson outdoors”.Mel McCree, a lecturer in early childhood studies at Bath Spa University, has coined the terms “FS full-fat” for forest schools that follow the principles, “FS lite” for ones that try but don’t succeed, and “FS ultra-lite” for those that are forest schools in name only.The Forest School Association (FSA), the professional body in the UK, promotes six principles on which sessions should be based.Not all of its 2,000 members will be leading a full forest school, says Gareth Wyn Davies, its chief executive. There are forest school leaders who are trained and committed but cannot deliver because their schools don’t have the money, or won’t devote the time to it, he says.“In addition, the term ‘forest school’ has taken on a life of its own. People are calling anything outdoorsy a forest school when it should be something held over a long period of time, be about child-centred learning and be engagement with the natural world,” he says.“It focuses on children being guided by their own curiosity rather than completing tasks set by the teacher. They are learning through play and discovery, collaboration and risk taking, climbing trees and using knives.”Forest schools should be offering children another way of learning, says Sackville-Ford. “In the education system at the moment when all that seems to matter is the Sats score, being a forest school gives legitimacy to other things.”What stands out in his memory is a 10-year-old boy who had little status in the classroom with his more fortunate peers. “It was quite a prosperous area and he was less successful academically and dismissed by many of his peers. In the forest school environment, when he could shin up a tree and light a fire in seconds, his peer group suddenly changed their approach to him,” he says.However, despite the anecdotal evidence of the benefits, there is a lack of formal research findings, says Mark Leather, a lecturer in outdoor education at the University of St Mark and St John, in Plymouth. He conducted a study of forest school research and reports in his paper – A critique of forest school: Something lost in translation – that he found no reliable evidence that it improved pupils’ confidence and self esteem.“I’m a great fan of the forest school movement and the way it seeks to provide a badge of quality but the commodification of it has created problems, including the tendency to make claims for the benefits that overreach the available evidence,” says Leather, a founder member of the British Education Research Association’s new Nature Outdoor Learning and Play special interest group.Done properly, the benefits are there for all to see, says Helen Davenport, a lecturer in primary education at MMU and a co-author of the book.“Being sat around a fire, being fully immersed in whittling a spoon, erecting a shelter or seeing a pupil in a new light can all fuel romantic thinking about alternative approaches to education,” she says. “You see children building a shelter with tarpaulins, sticks and ropes or making face paint out of nettles and some making bracelets out of saplings. It’s so calm. It’s magical.” On the other hand, she knows of sessions where what goes on inside is brought outside: “I’ve see written work from the classroom brought outside with worksheets and, on one occasion, desks as well,” she says. “That is not forest school, nor is it when the children come out to find laminated posters stuck to trees with number challenges and marker pens.”Critical Issues in Forest Schools by Mark Sackville-Ford \u0026amp Helen Davenport is published by SAGE.

This is released by cells in the ovaries and gives an indication of a woman’s ovarian reserve – the number of viable eggs the ovaries can produce. This level differs between women and is affected by a number of factors, including genetics, age and smoking. Its link to fertility is debatable: a low ovarian reserve does not necessarily mean natural conception will be difficult.However, La Marca said previous studies had suggested there could be a link between higher air pollution and reduced fertility in women, and animal models have inferred air pollution could affect levels of AMH.To explore the issue further, La Marca and colleagues looked at AMH levels in about 1,300 women, the samples being collected in Modena between early 2007 and autumn 2017. From the participants’ home addresses, the team estimated daily levels of small particulates known as PM2.5s and PM10s, as well as levels of nitrogen dioxide.For women over the age of 25, levels of AMH in the blood fell with age. After taking age into account, though, the team found AMH levels were lower among women who lived in areas with higher levels of air pollutants.La Marca said while the link between AMH levels and the chances of becoming pregnant naturally in the short term remained unclear, the results suggested environmental factors could play a role in female reproductive health.“Having a high AMH is in some way a reproductive advantage because women with a higher AMH are going to have a longer reproductive life,” he said, adding it was also significant to those undergoing IVF. “If you have a high AMH you will have a higher number of eggs after ovulatory stimulation which turn into a higher number of embryos,” he said.The study has limitations, not least that the team was unable to take into account other factors, such as poverty and poorer health, that tend to be more prevalent in areas of high pollution and might also affect AMH levels. What’s more, AMH and pollution levels were not tracked over time. Richard Anderson, a professor of clinical reproductive science at the University of Edinburgh, said while the impact of environmental factors on sperm count and quality was a topic of much research, there had been far less work on possible impacts on the female reproductive system.Anderson said questions remained. “There is uncertainty in whether this is a permanent effect, which might indicate perhaps a reduced reproductive life and an earlier menopause, or whether this is a temporary effect that women could recover from if they are no longer exposed to those chemicals,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54bfc54e0c6ecba0d845543872a0689ec98a2bcc/245_0_1910_1146/master/1910.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3aeed9de989242f4bb475ad6f9378f3f","title":"footage chickens big uk producer","story":"Secret filming at three Moy Park farms in Lincolnshire shows birds that are lame, struggling to breathe and surrounded by carcasses One of the UK’s biggest chicken producers has been keeping chickens in cramped conditions on three farms in Lincolnshire, including in enormous “double-decker” multi-storey buildings, where secretly filmed footage shows chickens that are lame, struggling to breathe and surrounded by dead birds.Undercover footage obtained by the charity Animal Equality earlier this year on Saltbox, Ladywath and Mount farms, all owned by Moy Park, shows chicks dead at what appears to be only a few days old, chickens suffering from leg injuries so bad they are unable to stand and carcasses left to rot for days among the flocks of living birds. There is, however, no suggestion that Moy Park has broken the law.One of the investigated farms, Ladywath, holds a recently built double-decker chicken shed, one of the first in the UK, with more than 30,000 birds on each floor. The site can hold up to 189,000 birds. has discovered that independently, before the campaigners released the footage, the industry assurance scheme Red Tractor visited the same farms and found them to be failing to meet its minimum standards for animal welfare.The three farms were inspected over April, May and June and given 28 days to comply with regulations or be suspended from the Red Tractor scheme. One has since been passed as having improved sufficiently while two are still within the 28-day period.A spokesperson for Red Tractor told the : “High animal welfare is one of our top priorities. Our own routine auditing of these farms had identified some breaches to our high standards, and we have been working with them to ensure they put the necessary processes in place for them to remain Red Tractor certified.”Animal Equality’s UK director, Toni Vernelli, said the video showed “horrifying conditions” and added that despite guidelines and industry audits, the intensive nature of farming makes it inherently cruel.“On every visit made to these overcrowded sheds, our investigators discovered severely lame birds collapsing under the weight of their abnormally large bodies. Unnatural conditions are standard on British chicken farms.”Earlier this year Moy Park launched a line of chicken products inspired by superhero comics. The “Pow!” and “Zap!” branded range are on sale in Ocado and Sainsbury’s.After being sent the footage by Animal Equality, Sainsbury’s said: “All our suppliers are expected to meet our high welfare standards and we are investigating this footage.”Ocado told the : “Our own brand Ocado products do not come from these three farms.” And a spokesperson for Tesco said: “We have strong procedures in place to ensure the welfare of the animals in our supply chain. We are working closely with our supplier to fully investigate this.”In a statement responding to the allegations of cruelty and poor conditions, the company said:“We have a zero-tolerance attitude toward anything that jeopardises the health and welfare of our birds and we are fully investigating these allegations. We have robust processes in place to carefully monitor the welfare conditions for our birds and we have regular independent audits, taking corrective action with our farming partners if required.”Both Red Tractor and Moy Park refused to give any details about the breaches of standards.Moy Park, which is owned by Brazilian-owned company Pilgrim’s, operates on an enormous scale within Britain’s growing chicken industry. It is the largest private sector employer in Northern Ireland and in June last year announced it was producing 6m birds a week for the first time.Vernelli said the sight of double-decker sheds is in itself a worrying trend.“Double-decker chicken houses are quite a new trend in the UK. This is taking industrial farming to a new level, farming animals in multi-storey buildings.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/246d57bf90aea0d186e21a402538b55a5b8e9012/0_88_4814_2890/master/4814.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0b261bd1ac0627442e9070ad22f4340","title":"italy china womens world cup match report","story":"Italy’s manager, Milena Bertolini, was asked how she intended to celebrate her 53rd birthday on Monday. “We want to move forward from the round of 16,” she answered without hesitation. “This would be the most wonderful birthday present. We have worked so long and hard to achieve this result.”Her players belatedly delivered 24 hours later, sending Le Azzurre into the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time since 1991 with a composed two-goal victory over China in Montpellier. Making their tournament return in France after two decades in the footballing wilderness, Bertolini’s side are now only three wins away from lifting the World Cup.“It is a great gift,” the coach joked afterwards. “I don’t know how far we can go in the tournament. We are giving absolutely everything in every match – but we know that the further we go in the competition, the higher the level will become.”Following rousing renditions of their respective national anthems under the burning Mediterranean sun, both teams began cautiously – as if needing a moment to catch their collective breath.Juventus’s Cristiana Girelli created the first opportunity in the 11th minute, slicing open China’s defence with a spectacular turn-and-pass towards Valentina Giacinti. The 25-year-old appeared to have opened her World Cup account with a driving shot past Peng Shimeng only to be called back for offside.Giacinti, making her second start of the tournament, did not have to wait long to compensate for that mistimed run. A darting move down the right-hand flank minutes later left the Milan forward alone and in possession. She crossed the ball, before – following a scramble in the penalty area – she collected a deflection from Peng’s attempted charge-down and converted to put Italy in front.Giacinti should have doubled her tally in the first half, finding herself one-on-one with Peng only to shoot wide – and then again receive another offside call. Such infractions have been a persistent theme of Italy’s campaign they had two goals disallowed against Australia in the opening group match and another chalked off against Brazil last week. It has not hurt them – yet.China wrestled back momentum in the latter stages of the first half, almost equalising on several occasions. But the interval halted the Iron Roses’ momentum, and Italy soon regained control.Five minutes after the resumption their first-half substitute, Aurora Galli, effortlessly dispatched the ball from the edge of the penalty area. As it flew into the bottom left corner past a ing Peng, it was clear to the ecstatic Italian fans that a hitherto nervy encounter had virtually been won. Try as they might, China were unable to conjure a reply – let alone two – as the half moved towards its conclusion.Italy now return to Valenciennes for Saturday’s quarter-final, their third game in the northern city, against the Netherlands. China, meanwhile, have plenty of soul-searching to undertake on their long journey home. Once a women’s footballing powerhouse and a two-time World Cup host, they have departed the tournament before the quarter-finals for the first-time.Before Tuesday’s game, Italy’s captain, Sara Gama, was asked if her teammates were suffering from vertigo after unexpectedly topping group C . In Montpellier on Tuesday, her team’s clinical victory indicated they do not seem to be afraid of heights."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26642c05241722147f087d83578c9ccb8c869369/90_123_3058_1835/master/3058.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e4a2a5f3cf9ff6f8d96cf1f27304f88","title":"netherlands japan womens world cup last 16 match report","story":"Refereeing was again in the spotlight as a controversial late penalty put the Netherlands into a quarter-final against Italy at the expense of a Japan side in the ascendancy. In the 88th minute Vivianne Miedema smashed the ball goalwards but it rocketed off the limp arm of Saki Kumagai and the referee pointed to the spot. Lieke Martens, whose lovely backheel had given the Dutch the lead, converted.Japan’s manager, Asako Takakura, diplomatically blamed their lack of cutting edge in front of goal for the result but admitted she was sad at the manner of their defeat. “We created many chances, however we just couldn’t capitalise on them and towards the end we created the crisis ourselves,” she said. “Now we have VAR – for the players sometimes cruel decisions have been made. It happened to us towards the end of the match and I’m sorry for that, but we have to look forward and we have to accept the decision.”Japan had made three changes to the starting XI that disappointed against England, Yuika Sugasawa, Yui Hasegawa and Narumi Miura stepping into the breach, and it was the combination of the former two with the always dangerous Mana Iwabuchi that would provide them with the fluidity they had been searching for, combining wonderfully for the leveller, but it was not enough.It would be fair to say that both the Netherlands and Japan have failed to find their rhythm in France. The Dutch went into this game with three wins from three but had looked weak defensively while the Japanese, with one eye on hosting the 2020 Olympic Games, had blooded some of their youth prospects and disrupted their usual crispness in possession.In the warm evening air of Rennes, both the European and the Asian champions showed flashes of brilliance. And that was reflected in the two first-half goals.Martens, the Euro 2017 Golden Ball winner, was the star when the Oranje defied the odds two years ago, earning a big-money move to Barcelona in the process. She has not underwhelmed since but she has not continued on the trajectory many expected either.Here she looked a different beast and on 17 minutes she had the reward for her graft. A Sherida Spitse corner was lofted to her at the near post and she coolly stuck out a heel to flick the ball goalwards. It took a slight deflection as it slipped through the legs of Yuika Sugasawa before rolling in near the far post, but the finish was glorious. It was her fifth goal against Japan, the most she has scored against any opponent.“You play using your intuition, it really went well. It had a little bit of ankle but it worked so fine,” she said.As if to immediately remind the Dutch of their vulnerability Sugasawa, looking to make amends, squeezed between the centre-backs, Merel van Dongen and Stefanie van der Gragt but her shot cannoned off Sari van Veenendaal’s left post.It was a warning they failed to heed and with half-time approaching Japan pounced. Having scored only twice, and only one of them from open play, the 2011 world champions had struggled to find the target despite creating chance after chance. Suddenly, though, it clicked, Sugasawa laid the ball back from the middle of the box to Mana Iwabuchi and the forward twisted free and slid a wonderful ball between the centre-backs to Hasegawa, who lifted the ball over a helpless Van Veenendaal.A quiet period ensued, but then Takakura’s side ramped things up. Iwabuchi fed Hina Sugita out wide, she cut inside and lashed the ball goalwards but it clattered off the underside of the bar. Iwabuchi, again at the centre of everything for Japan, was later on hand to poke a cross back from six yards to the substitute Yuka Momiki but Van Veenendaal denied them the advantage.Finally, panic in the Japan box put the ball at the feet of Miedema and the forward’s shot deflected off Kumagai’s arm. And Martens sent Yamashita the wrong way. “I haven’t seen it,” said Martens of the handball incident. “Some other people said it was harsh as well, I didn’t see it on the pitch. But VAR has made the decision and the referee made a decision, we’re really happy with that and sometimes you also need a little bit of luck.”Up next is Italy in Valenciennes, an hour’s drive from the Dutch border. “It’s really amazing to play there again,” added Martens. “We really felt like we played at home so we hope we’ll have lots of support again. I’m really looking forward to that game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3152a15649abb0b838502a5263c76c120bef347/0_170_2359_1415/master/2359.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7525ad68594a9a9d25b607a23c17e29f","title":"transfer roundup spurs lyon ndombele west ham rondon","story":"Tottenham have made a club record £55m (€62m) bid for the Lyon midfielder Tanguy Ndombélé and are confident of closing a deal for one of the most exciting young talents in Europe.Mauricio Pochettino has made the 22-year-old France international his prime summer target as he seeks new impetus at the club after spending five years in charge, and negotiations with Lyon are at an advanced stage.The French club were holding out for €75m for Ndombélé, who possesses a rare blend of skill and power, and Spurs had previously indicated that they valued him at €50m. But in a move that stands to delight Pochettino, they have pushed hard towards a compromise fee. They believe that the numbers will be acceptable to Lyon while they also feel that Ndombélé wants to join them.Spurs’s current transfer record is the £42m that they paid to take the central defender Davinson Sánchez from Ajax in the summer of 2017. They will propose a five-year contract to Ndombélé.Pochettino has been keen to strengthen in midfield, having lost Mousa Dembélé to the Chinese club Guangzhou R\u0026ampF last January and with Christian Eriksen agitating for a move, it is thought that he would like to sign more than one player in the position. Spurs have held talks with the representatives of Roma’s Nicolo Zaniolo and Ajax’s Donny van de Beek but a deal for either is not thought to be close.It is Ndombélé that Pochettino covets and he has told Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman, that he is precisely the kind of player that the club ought to be signing.Pochettino does not consider his squad to be a particularly young one any more and Ndombélé, who would become his first signing since that of Lucas Moura from Paris St-Germain in January 2018, would bring fresh dynamism.Funds remain tight at the club as Levy balances the repayments on the new stadium project, although the team’s unexpected run to the Champions League final did bring a windfall.Eriksen remains a key part of the summer puzzle and his potential sale would help to balance the books. Real Madrid have shown an interest in the Dane.Ndombélé, capped six times by France, has been monitored by a clutch of leading clubs including Real, Manchester City and the Italian champions Juventus. Spurs sense a coup.André Gomes has said it was an “easy decision” to join Everton permanently after completing his move from Barcelona for £22m plus add-ons.The Portugal international signed a five-year contract with Everton on Tuesday having enjoyed a successful season on loan with Marco Silva’s side. West Ham United were also interested in the midfielder but the 25-year-old made it clear to the Spanish champions that he was set on a return to Goodison Park, where his career was revived following a difficult time at the Camp Nou.Gomes’ fee could eventually reach £25m with bonus payments. Securing the former Benfica and Valencia player on a permanent basis this summer was a priority for manager Silva, who also wants to sign Kurt Zouma for the long-term following the Chelsea defender’s successful loan spell.Everton’s new signing said: “It was an easy decision and I’m very happy to have made it. I know the club made a massive effort to sign me and I’m very happy and thankful to them. I said during the year that I felt part of a family and that is the most important thing to me.The Everton manager said: “André was a really important player for us last season and I think we were really able to help him, too. It was a good decision to bring André to the club and we made it one of our priorities to get him back.”Meanwhile West Ham are pondering whether to step up their interest in Salomón Rondón after having an opening bid of £10m for the West Bromwich Albion striker rejected.Rondón had an impressive year on loan at Newcastle United last season, scoring 11 goals, and Rafael Benítez was determined to sign him again on a permanent deal. However Manuel Pellegrini is an admirer of the Venezuelan after working with him at Málaga and he hopes to use the news that Benítez is set to leave Newcastle to his advantage.Pellegrini wants a new striker after releasing Andy Carroll on a free transfer and selling Lucas Pérez to Alavés. West Ham have had a £25m bid for Celta Vigo’s Maxi Gomez turned down and fear missing out on the Uruguayan to Valencia, who can offer the striker Champions League football.The London club will move for both Gomez and Róndon if they can sell Javier Hernández, who earns £140,000 a week.A deal for Rondon, whose contract contains a £16.5m release clause, could be easier to pull off given that West Brom, who have just appointed the former West Ham manager Slaven Bilic, missed out on promotion to the Premier League last season.The west Midland club’s technical director, Luke Dowling, has said Rondon, who has also been linked with Wolves, will leave this summer. “We’re quite happy to say that we will sell Salomón,” he said. “We don’t want a player that’s had a season like that staying around with us and walking away on a Bosman.”However West Brom do not want to lose the 30-year-old on the cheap and West Ham, who also offered to send Sam Byram and Jordan Hugill to the Hawthorns, must decide whether to return with a higher bid. It is thought that Bilic is not interested in taking Hugill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34241d7a958a24bc0a52be6a3ba502580b55aae8/0_341_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29099b8b43e65da8f49d78a88564c97f","title":"tell us about the one lifestyle change that worked for you","story":"As part of a series exploring how one change can make a profound personal impact, we want to hear from youWhat is the most impactful lifestyle change that you have made that has improved your health and wellbeing?

A city that is unfortunately so near to Birmingham that it is often forgotten about, but also fortunately just far enough away that we don’t speak with that accent. In fact, “we speak with an accent that’s exceedingly rare!” At least that’s what the Coventry City fans sing every week, whether it’s at the Ricoh Arena or at away games up and down the country – or that season we played our home games in Northampton, but we don’t talk about that.Luckily, due to our location on one of the country’s most central rail lines, it’s incredibly easy for us to get to just about anywhere in the UK, whether it be for football, shopping, boozing, sightseeing, or … what else is there?And if you’re coming to us by rail (TIP: London Northwestern Railway has FREE wifi in every carriage), there are some unspoken things you should know about us lot, located smack bang in the middle of England.No, Coventry is not basically BirminghamThis assertion is lazy geography. We are 20 miles away from Birmingham. Sunderland is barely 15 miles away from Newcastle upon Tyne but you wouldn’t say “Newcastle is basically in Sunderland”, unless you wanted to get banished from the north-east forever. Solihull is a town that is “basically” Birmingham. We are our own city, with enough cathedrals to spare (more on that in a minute).Coventry – and its spirit – is indestructibleDue to our extremely central location – Meriden, the traditional centre of England is just 8 miles away – we’ve often found ourselves in the middle of some heated situations. The most notable of which was the Coventry blitz, which took place on the night of the 14 November 1940. It was the single most concentrated attack on a British city during the second world war. It lasted for 11 hours as the Luftwaffe essentially attempted to knock Coventry off the map, being one of the UK’s major centres for war production. The old cathedral was mostly destroyed during that raid, but its remains now serve as a phenomenal event space.We also have a rich history of cathedralsWhile the old cathedral was destroyed, as mentioned, we had an old, old cathedral that Henry VIII ordered to be destroyed during the dissolution of the monasteries in the early 16th century. What remains of it is still standing and open to the public in the Priory undercrofts, which was dug up by Tony Robinson for a Time Team special in 1999 on Channel 4. Side note: There is a Nando’s right next to the Priory gardens, so you can make a decent afternoon of history and chicken.Enjoy flying abroad? You have us to thank for thatIf we are honest, we aren’t the greatest at making a big deal about the things we’ve done in the past. For a city that was essentially the beating heart of the country’s motor industry, we should at least talk about it as much as Brummies like to talk about how they are the second city.But more impressive than that is Coventry’s very own Sir Frank Whittle. No, it’s not just the name of a school in Walsgrave – Sir Frank Whittle was the genius behind the modern jet engine, which effectively changed the world.When Sir Frank first brought forward his plans to the UK’s Air Ministry in 1929, his blueprints were called “impractical”. Just eight years later, in 1937, his Whittle Unit engine roared into life, and by 1941 jet-powered planes were heading to war. The rest, as they say, is history.If you call it the Phoenix or the Kasbah, we know you are a studentClubs change names, that’s true, but we never forget – or stop calling them by – their older names.That club on Primrose Hill Street in Hillfields is The Colly (or Colosseum for the more formal among you) not the Kasbah, despite what it says above the doors. Those who really know their history will recall a brief period in the early 90s when it was called the Tic Toc, and played host to Blur and Ocean Colour Scene amid Britpop fever. The Phoenix? That’s the Colin Campbell or the Campbell to those who grew up here. And the building with the domed roof opposite? Before it was a Cov Uni building it was an old Odeon theatre.We still really hate Aston VillaIt’s been nearly 20 years since both clubs were even in the same ision – the 200001 season of the Premier League – but we still despise the Birmingham club, with a passion. Attend any Coventry City game and you’ll hear the fans singing “S**t on the Villa”. It’s not clever, but it is funny. The reason why? That’s open to debate, but what’s football without rivalry?We birthed skaIt’s yer da’s favourite thing to put on the pub jukebox – and for good reason. He was probably there when Coventry musicians the Specials and the Selecter put 2-Tone on the map.The Specials’ 1980 hit Ghost Town is a song that still encapsulates Coventry. At least that’s what the band’s drummer John Bradbury said in 2011: “When I think about Ghost Town I think about Coventry.”It’s a batchIt’s an argument that’s been done to its doughy death on Facebook and Instagram, but when it comes to a bread roll we call it a batch because it IS a batch and this is why: batch originates from the German word meaning “to bake” or “bacan” in old English. Over time this evolved into “process of baking” to “event of baking” to “the set of things baked” and eventually to a “set of things”, ie a batch. And these bread rolls would be baked in batches too.

Famed for shoemaking and its connection to the late Princess Diana, it’s easy to reach from England’s major cities, as well as much of the rest of the UK. I myself commute between London and Northampton with London Northwestern Railway using their cheap turn up and go off-peak returns (and even cheaper super off-peak day-returns). If you’re visiting, make sure to follow these unwritten rules and make the most of your trip.You should drink local beer (including Carlsberg)Northampton is home to the Carlsberg brewery, and in and around the surrounding areas of Far Cotton you can smell the golden liquid in the atmosphere as it brews. As well as local breweries and great pubs, Northampton is also home to Warner Edwards gin, founded in 2012 on Falls Farm. Tom Warner and partner Tina Warner-Keogh’s dream to save the world from mediocre gin has created several experimental varieties, from tangy rhubarb and lemon balm to honeybee, which you can see crafted and distilled on a bookable tour.We take our shoes very seriously …Some of the finest English shoes were – and are still – made in Northampton. The 2005 film Kinky Boots – now a Broadway musical – put Northampton on the map. It was inspired by the true story of family shoemakers, WJ Brookes, whose real-life owner Steve Pateman ventured into the niche market of erotic footwear to save his business and the jobs of those who worked for him. This is on top of Church’s (now owned by Prada), which was founded in Northampton. Other recognisable brands manufactured here include Dr Martens, JuJu and Grenson.… And our music even more seriouslyNorthampton is a town that can take pride in the growing number of emerging artists who call it home, including rapper Slowthai, who is winning serious critical attention for his off-kilter Grime and outlandish style, in addition to making it to the BBC Sound of 2019 list.Following in his footsteps is rising rap star Izzie Gibbs, while local indie songstress VV Brown (fun fact: her parents founded Overstone Park school) proves that Northampton is home to all kinds of sonic brilliance. Local legend has it that Bob Marley even performed in Northampton once. I, for one, like to believe it’s true.All Northamptonians must proudly rep the city (our DJs sure do)They say it takes one to know one, and listening to the radio as a Northamptonian, I’m always pleased to hear our townfolk on the airwaves. DJ Charlie Sloth, who lives in Northampton, has helped promote bundles of local talent on his show, such as Izzie Gibbs. Radio 1 and 1Xtra DJ Mista Jam also calls Northampton home, commuting back and forth to London, and Radio 2 has proud Northamptonian Jo Whiley. She was born in Bugbrooke and still lives nearby with her family. (Another fun fact: Jay-Z visited her house once. How many people can say that?)Talking sports will win local heartsWe love sports. We really do. We love it so much that when local rugby team, the Saints, won the rugby premiership in 2014, a whopping 30,000 Northamptonians poured out into the streets to see the team on an open-top bus. Spark up a conversation with any local about our cricket club, or football club (last fun fact: Northampton Town FC’s associate director is Graham Carr, father of presenter Alan Carr) and you’re sure to win their heart over.Indulge in some celeb spottingFor Northamptonians, seeing one of our own make it big brings an enormous sense of pride, but we’ve now produced so many celebrities it’s hard to keep up. There’s cult writer Alan Moore (of Watchmen fame), the aforementioned TV presenter and comedian Alan Carr, Game of Thrones actor Sophie Turner and YouTubers Kaushal Beauty and Louise Pentland (also known as Sprinkle of Glitter). Hollywood actor Errol Flynn worked where the Royal Derngate Theatre now stands, and has a film house named after him.Make sure you enjoy the flora and faunaNorthampton’s surrounds are home to some of Britain’s loveliest creatures. At nearby Salcey forest, an ancient woodland, you’ll find rare animal habitats, while some of the oaks are up to 600 years old. For something more hands-on, visit the Menagerie at Castle Ashby to feed the meerkats (and spot the giant tortoise).Festivals are a big dealOne of Northampton’s main attractions is its festivals. The family-focused Northampton town festival attracts more than 65,000 people each year, and has become as beloved as the Northampton balloon festival, now in its 30th year. Smaller, but equally stunning events include the community Diwali celebrations in Market Square and the Northampton carnival.Indulge your inner royal at Althorp HouseAlthorp House is the childhood home of the late Princess Diana, as well as her final resting place. The Northamptonshire grounds are open to the public during certain times of the year, and host a number of events, including the award-winning annual Althorp food and drink festival. For other leisurely royal activities, take afternoon tea at Rushden House and amble through the grounds of Delapre Abbey.

Lately it has also been a way to transmit the neuroses of Donald Trump into all of our phones on a near constant basis. But this week a Twitter user devised a use of the social media platform that’s actually fun – a choose-your-own-adventure game involving Beyoncé.In the game, “Being Beyoncé’s assistant for the day”, the object is simple: don’t get fired – and it’s a lot harder than it sounds. Celebrities who might know a thing or two about having personal assistants have had trouble themselves, including Questlove, who tweeted that he “failed the first time”.Chrissy Teigen said that she only made it about three rounds, while her own assistant got fired immediately.While the choices on any given prompt might seem obvious to members of the Beyhive, the difficulty comes in trying to anticipate the whims of a Beyoncé character who, at least in this game, seems like something of a tyrant.Asked which of her children you should suggest she FaceTime at one turn in the game, if you choose incorrectly you are let go on the spot.It’s not entirely clear why getting yelled at and terminated by Beyoncé is such an avid fantasy for so many, but contemporary fandom is strange, and who are we to judge?The person behind the game is Landon Rivera, a student in Los Angeles. He made the game for obsessive Beyoncé fans, he told Vice, “but then it got really popular”. It has been retweeted almost 100,000 times in the few days since he posted it.Of course, there is the slim chance that Beyoncé herself is behind this and it’s all real, as actor Shay Mitchell tweeted.

By  Andy BeckettFor almost half a century, something vital has been missing from leftwing politics in western countries. Since the 70s, the left has changed how many people think about prejudice, personal identity and freedom. It has exposed capitalism’s cruelties. It has sometimes won elections, and sometimes governed effectively afterwards. But it has not been able to change fundamentally how wealth and work function in society – or even provide a compelling vision of how that might be done. The left, in short, has not had an economic policy.Instead, the right has had one. Privatisation, deregulation, lower taxes for business and the rich, more power for employers and shareholders, less power for workers – these interlocking policies have intensified capitalism, and made it ever more ubiquitous. There have been immense efforts to make capitalism appear inevitable to depict any alternative as impossible.In this increasingly hostile environment, the left’s economic approach has been reactive – resisting these huge changes, often in vain – and often backward-looking, even nostalgic. For many decades, the same two critical analysts of capitalism, Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes, have continued to dominate the left’s economic imagination. Marx died in 1883, Keynes in 1946. The last time their ideas had a significant influence on western governments or voters was 40 years ago, during the turbulent final days of postwar social democracy. Ever since, rightwingers and centrists have caricatured anyone arguing that capitalism should be reined in – let alone reshaped or replaced – as wanting to take the world “back to the 70s”. Altering our economic system has been presented as a fantasy – no more practical than time travel.And yet, in recent years, that system has started to fail. Rather than sustainable and widely shared prosperity, it has produced wage stagnation, ever more workers in poverty, ever more inequality, banking crises, the convulsions of populism and the impending climate catastrophe. Even senior rightwing politicians sometimes concede the seriousness of the crisis. At last year’s Conservative conference, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, admitted that “a gap has opened up” in the west “between the theory of how a market economy delivers … and the reality”. He went on: “Too many people feel that … the system is not working for them.”There is a dawning recognition that a new kind of economy is needed: fairer, more inclusive, less exploitative, less destructive of society and the planet. “We’re in a time when people are much more open to radical economic ideas,” says Michael Jacobs, a former prime ministerial adviser to Gordon Brown. “The voters have revolted against neoliberalism. The international economic institutions – the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund – are recognising its downsides.” Meanwhile, the 2008 financial crisis and the previously unthinkable government interventions that halted it have discredited two central neoliberal orthodoxies: that capitalism cannot fail, and that governments cannot step in to change how the economy works.A huge political space has opened up. In Britain and the US, in many ways the most capitalist western countries, and the ones where its problems are starkest, an emerging network of thinkers, activists and politicians has begun to seize this opportunity. They are trying to construct a new kind of leftwing economics: one that addresses the flaws of the 21st-century economy, but which also explains, in practical ways, how future leftwing governments could create a better one.Christine Berry, a young British freelance academic, is one of the network’s central figures. “We’re stripping economics back to basics,” she says. “We want economics to ask: ‘Who owns these resources? Who has power in this company?’ Conventional economic discourse obfuscates these questions, to the benefit of those with power.”The new leftwing economics wants to see the redistribution of economic power, so that it is held by everyone – just as political power is held by everyone in a healthy democracy. This redistribution of power could involve employees taking ownership of part of every company or local politicians reshaping their city’s economy to favour local, ethical businesses over large corporations or national politicians making co-operatives a capitalist norm.This “democratic economy” is not some idealistic fantasy: bits of it are already being constructed in Britain and the US. And without this transformation, the new economists argue, the increasing inequality of economic power will soon make democracy itself unworkable. “If we want to live in democratic societies, then we need to … allow communities to shape their local economies,” write Joe Guinan and Martin O’Neill, both prolific advocates of the new economics, in a recent article for the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) – a thinktank previously associated with New Labour. “It is no longer good enough to see the economy as some kind of separate technocratic domain in which the central values of a democratic society somehow do not apply.” Moreover, Guinan and O’Neill argue, making the economy more democratic will actually help to revitalise democracy: voters are less likely to feel angry, or apathetic, if they are included in economic decisions that fundamentally affect their lives.The new economists’ enormously ambitious project means transforming the relationship between capitalism and the state between workers and employers between the local and global economy and between those with economic assets and those without. “Economic power and control must rest more equally,” declared a report last year by the New Economics Foundation (NEF), a radical London thinktank that has acted as an incubator for many of the new movement’s members and ideas.In the past, left-of-centre British governments have attempted to reshape the economy by taxation – usually focused on income rather than other forms of economic power – and by nationalisation, which usually meant replacing a private-sector management elite with a state-appointed one. Instead of such limited, patchily successful interventions, the new economists want to see much more systemic and permanent change. They want – at the least – to change how capitalism works. But, crucially, they want this change to be only partially initiated and overseen by the state, not controlled by it. They envisage a transformation that happens almost organically, driven by employees and consumers – a sort of non-violent revolution in slow motion.The result, the new economists claim, will be an economy that suits society, rather than – as we have at present – a society subordinated to the economy. The new economics, suggests Berry, isn’t really economics at all. It’s “a new view of the world”.In the excitable but often intellectually becalmed world of British politics, the arrival of a significant new set of ideas tends to generate certain responses. Events about it are packed out. Ambitious young researchers gravitate towards it. Adventurous older thinkers are intrigued by it. New intellectual institutions are created around it. Mainstream journalists initially dismiss it.Over the past year, the left’s new economics has acquired this status. Jacobs, who is nearing 60, spent the New Labour era trying, and largely failing, to persuade centrist politicians that the economy needed drastically reshaping. “But nowadays,” he told me, “I’m thinking: ‘Oh God, we finally might be able to do it.’”Like all the new economists I met, he talks very fast, cutting short sentences as if there is too much to explain in the time available. A longstanding environmentalist, he describes the emerging network of new economists as “an ecosystem”. Like the one that produced Thatcherism in the 70s, this network may involve only a few dozen people, whose polemics and talks and policy papers are being followed by an audience in the hundreds, but there is an intoxicating sense of political and economic taboos being broken, and of a potential new consensus being born.“There are British and American websites that publish a lot of our stuff, like openDemocracy, Jacobin and Novara. There are people producing stuff while freelancing for thinktanks – or setting up new thinktanks. And social media means the ideas spread, and collaborations happen, much faster than when leftwing economics was just about meetings and pamphlets,” Jacobs says. “It’s slightly incestuous, but it’s rather thrilling.”This ferment is beginning to solidify into a movement. The New Economy Organisers Network (Neon), a NEF spin-off based in London, runs workshops for leftwing activists, to learn how “to build support for a new economy” – for example, by telling effective “stories” about it in the mainstream media. Stir to Action, an activist organisation based in Bridport in Dorset, publishes a quarterly “magazine for the new economy”, and organises advice sessions in left-leaning cities such as Bristol and Oxford: Worker Co-ops: How to Get Started, Community Ownership: What If We Ran It Ourselves?“There’s a totally new impulse to activism about the economy now,” says the magazine’s editor, Jonny Gordon-Farleigh, who was previously involved in anticapitalist and environmental protests. “The movement has gone from oppose to propose.”Others in the movement are more bullish. Last autumn, a widely circulated article by Guinan and O’Neill in the leftwing journal Renewal claimed that McDonnell could be planning nothing less than a “transformation of the British economy … a radical programme for dismantling and displacing corporate and financial power in Britain”, in favour of the less privileged. Guinan told me: “John McDonnell is extremely intellectually curious. I haven’t seen another political figure at that level of seniority whose doors are so open to new thinking.”James Meadway, until recently one of McDonnell’s key advisers, is now writing a book about “an economy for the many”. Between 2010 and 2015, Meadway worked at NEF, where his reports and articles sketched out many of the new economists’ arguments. Several NEF staffers told me that since McDonnell became shadow chancellor, the usual relationship between leftwing thinktanks and Labour had been reversed: instead of desperately trying to draw the party’s attention to their proposals, they were struggling to keep up with Labour’s appetite for them. “They’re virtually asking, ‘Have you got anything else at the back of your cupboard?’” says one delighted but slightly perplexed NEF veteran. “We scrabble around, and give them anything we can come up with, as quickly as we can.”Last July, NEF published a report advocating a sharp increase in the number of British co-operatives. On one of its later pages, with almost no fanfare, the report also proposed that conventional companies be required to give their employees shares, to create what NEF called an “inclusive ownership fund”. In September, with a few modifications, the proposal became Labour party policy. “I’ve never seen anything like it, from thinktank idea to adoption as policy!” says Mathew Lawrence, one of the report’s authors. This month, a version of the policy was also adopted by the US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.And yet, outside McDonnell’s circle and the transatlantic radical left, the new economics has gone largely unnoticed – or been casually derided. The black holes of Brexit and the Tory leadership contest are partly responsible, sucking attention away from everything else. But so is the radical nature of the new economics itself. Transforming or ending capitalism as we know it – the new economists differ as to which is the goal – is a difficult idea for most British politicians and journalists to take on board. After half a century accepting the economic status quo, they associate any leftwing alternatives to it either with out-of-date postwar social democracy – aka “the 70s” – or with leftwing authoritarianism, with present-day Venezuela or the Soviet Union.However often McDonnell says in interviews that he wants to see a democratic economy, the adjective most frequently applied to him is still “Marxist”. “The new economic thinking is almost like a frequency that can’t be heard,” says Guinan.But with neoliberalism ailing, and the right bereft of other economic ideas, as the Conservative leadership contest is currently demonstrating, the left’s new economics may have a long fut ure – whether or not McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party wins power. To borrow a line from Thatcher, there is now an alternative.The dream of a democratic economy has flickered on the margins of leftwing politics for at least a century. During the early 1920s, the British socialist theorists GDH Cole and RH Tawney both wrote fresh, provocative books arguing that workers should manage themselves, rather than submit to employers or shareholders – or to the state, as more orthodox Labour thinkers envisaged. In economic life, as in politics, Tawney argued in 1921, “men should not be ruled by an authority which they cannot control”.This empowerment of the workers was intended to be the first step in a larger transformation. “The real aim,” wrote Cole in 1920, should be “wresting bit by bit from the hands of the possessing classes the economic power which they now exercise”, in order to ultimately “make possible an equitable distribution of the national income and a reasonable reorganisation of Society as a whole”.Yet Cole was vague about how this overturning of the traditional order would happen. He ruled out a revolution, and a general strike, on the grounds that workers did not have the necessary access to weapons, or the economic resources to beat their employers in a protracted industrial struggle. A bold Labour government could, in theory, pass the necessary legislation but the Labour administrations of the 1920s and 30s were cautious, and did not last long.When Labour did acquire the confidence and time to reconfigure the economy, during the premierships of Clement Attlee in the 40s and Harold Wilson in the 60s, the party chose to do so through Whitehall plans and bureaucracies, such as Wilson’s Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), rather than by democratising the economy. The results were mixed: the DEA lasted only five years.It was not until the 70s that a powerful Labour politician became interested in democratising the economy. Unusually for a Westminster grandee, Tony Benn paid close attention to the decline of deference and growth of inidualism during the decade. “More people want to do more for themselves,” he wrote in 1970. “Technology releases forces that permit and encourage decentralisation … It must be a prime objective of socialists to work for the redistribution of power.”In 1974, Wilson made Benn secretary of state for industry. The economy was struggling. Benn oversaw and subsidised worker-run cooperatives at three ailing large businesses: the Scottish Daily News, a Glasgow newspaper Kirkby Manufacturing and Engineering, a Liverpool maker of radiators and Meriden, a producer of motorcycles in the West Midlands. The challenges these co-operatives faced – a lack of previous investment, and strong foreign or domestic competitors – were made worse by unsympathetic, economically conservative civil servants in Benn’s department. An even-handed 1981 report on the cooperatives by the leftwing magazine New Internationalist described them as doomed from the start – they were “crippled giants”.The Scottish Daily News cooperative lasted five months. The Kirby cooperative did better. Eric Heffer, a minister working for Benn, found trade union shop stewards there “transformed by their experiences” of helping run the business. They became “real worker-managers”. The cooperative made it through the mid-70s recession. But soon after the 1979 election, Margaret Thatcher’s incoming government terminated the experiment by cancelling Kirkby’s subsidies. Meriden survived the change of government, and another recession in the early 80s. But it went bankrupt in 1983.Benn himself lasted only a year in the industry department, before he was removed by Wilson, who had never completely accepted his radicalism. Benn never held such a pivotal economic post again. Just as significantly, the saga “undermined the co-operative option in Labour party policymaking circles for decades to come,” says Gordon-Farleigh.From Benn’s demotion in 1975 until Jeremy Corbyn’s election as leader 40 years later, the Labour hierarchy broadly accepted that the economy should be based on profit, competition, and top-down management. The attempts by Benn and others on the British left during the 70s to establish what they sometimes provocatively called “workers’ control” were largely forgotten, or remembered as just another of a derided decade’s failed utopias. The chance for a democratic economy seemed to have gone.Yet during the lean years that followed for the British left, another experiment in democratising the economy began – across the Atlantic, in a country less associated with revolts against capitalism. It was more local, but also more thorough than Benn’s backing of a scattering of vulnerable co-operatives, and it sought to mobilise the power of consumers rather than producers.Gar Alperovitz is an 83-year-old American economist and activist. Since the 60s, he has doggedly promoted economic innovations that put social before commercial goals. Often, he has been a fringe figure, but intermittently he has attracted wide attention. In 1983, he featured heavily in a Time magazine cover story about the future of the economy. In 2000, at the University of Maryland, he co-founded the Democracy Collaborative, a centre for research about how to revive the political and economic life of declining parts of the US, which gradually expanded into an activist body as well.“Troubled American cities are in a more advanced state of decay than their British equivalents,” says Guinan, who has worked for the Democracy Collaborative for a decade. “But American local government also has greater powers. So you have the ability to create radical new models from the ground up.”In 2008, the Democracy Collaborative began working in Cleveland, one of America’s poorest big cities, which had been losing jobs and residents for decades. The activists followed an Alperovitz strategy called “community wealth-building”. It aims to end struggling local economies’ reliance on unequal relationships with distant, wealth-extracting corporations – such as chain retailers – and to base these economies around local, more socially conscious businesses instead.In Cleveland, the Democracy Collaborative helped set up a solar power company, an industrial laundry, and a city-centre hydroponic farm growing lettuces and basil. All three enterprises were owned by their employees, and some of their profits went to a holding company tasked with establishing more cooperatives in the city. All three enterprises have succeeded, so far. The goal of the project was summed up in blunt, almost populist terms by one of the Democracy Collaborative’s co-founders, Ted Howard, in 2017: “Stop the leakage of money out of our community.” Yet “community wealth building” also has a more subtle purpose: it is a concrete demonstration that economic decisions can be based on more than neoliberalism’s narrow criteria.Howard was speaking at a new economics conference in England, which had been organised by McDonnell. The two men are on first-name terms. Last year, McDonnell introduced Howard at another Labour event, in Preston: “We bring him across on a regular basis now, to explain the work that he’s done.”McDonnell has long been interested in decentralising and democratising the economy. He frequently cites Tawney, Cole and Benn in speeches. During the 80s, McDonnell was deputy leader and effectively the chancellor of the Greater London Council (GLC), which pursued Benn-style experiments with state-backed co-operatives, with similarly mixed results, until it was abolished by Thatcher in 1986.Contrary to his usual portrayal as a statist ogre, McDonnell believes there are limits to how far the left can increase taxes and government spending. In his view, many voters are unwilling, or simply unable, to pay much more tax – especially when living standards are squeezed, as now. He also believes that central government has lost authority: it is seen as simultaneously too weak, short of money thanks to austerity and too strong – too intrusive and domineering towards citizens. Instead of relying on the state to create a better society, one of McDonnell’s close allies argues, leftwing governments, at both the municipal and national level, “have to get into changing how capitalism works”.In recent years, with McDonnell and Corbyn’s encouragement, and guidance from the Democracy Collaborative, many of the principles of “the Cleveland model”, as it is reverently known in transatlantic leftwing circles, have been adopted by the Labour-run council in the small, ex-industrial city of Preston in Lancashire. The regeneration has been promoted as a foretaste of Britain under a Corbyn government.Preston’s hilltop city centre, which had been fading for decades, now has a refurbished and busy covered market, new artists’ studios in former council offices, and coffee and craft beer being sold from converted shipping containers right behind the town hall. All these enterprises have been facilitated by the council. Less visibly, but probably more importantly, the city’s large concentration of other public sector bodies – a hospital, a university, a police headquarters – have been persuaded by the council to procure goods and services locally whenever possible, becoming what the Democracy Collaborative calls “anchor institutions”. They now spend almost four times as much of their budgets in Preston as they did in 2013.The council leader is Matthew Brown, an intense, angular 46-year-old who was partly inspired to enter politics by seeing Benn on television as a teenager. “What we’re doing in Preston is common sense, but it’s also ideological,” Brown told me, when we met in his sparse office. “We’re living through a systemic crisis of capitalism, and we’ve got to create alternatives.” By doing so – especially at a time when local councils are supposed to have been hugely weakened by government cuts – Preston is in small but visible ways undermining the authority of neoliberalism, dependent as it is on the insistence that no other economic options are possible.I asked whether he had any doubts about a city with a population of less than 150,000 acting as a model for reshaping the whole British economy – and by implication, economies beyond. “No,” he said. “I’m quite strong-minded.”There is a confidence about the new economists, which comes as a surprise after all the left’s defeats during the 80s and 90s. But with capitalism less effective and popular than it was then, the new economists believe they are now engaged in what the political theorist Antonio Gramsci – a big influence on them and McDonnell – called a “war of position”: a steady accumulation of alliances, ideas and public credibility. Berry describes this process as a “transition” that can lead to a different economy. McDonnell told me in 2017 that he wanted “a staged transformation of our economic system”. If enough other Labour councils copy Preston – and quite a few are interested – then even without a Corbyn government, let alone any kind of socialist revolution, the British economy will have moved leftwards, both in the priorities it chooses and the interests it favours.He offered no more details. But the “inclusive ownership fund” policy adopted by Labour shows the potential of the new economic ideas. The funds are intended to be Trojan horses: inserting into a company’s ownership structure a group of shareholders – its employees – who are more likely to favour higher wages and long-term investment. “The funds are meant to tip the balance,” says Lawrence, “towards a different kind of corporate culture.” Or as the writer and activist Hilary Wainwright, one of the Labour left’s shrewdest thinkers since the 70s, puts it: “Radical change, when it destabilises the status quo in the right way, creates further opportunities for change.”Before NEF, Fahnbulleh worked for the cabinet office and the 10 Downing Street strategy unit. She predicts there will be Whitehall resistance to the new economics: “Whitehall hates big change – every time.” Jacobs, who has longer experience of government, is slightly more optimistic. “Some of the younger Treasury people will probably be quite excited by a new economic approach. Some of the older ones will think it’s all wrong. And others will just implement whatever the government asks.”He has helped run seminars for McDonnell and his team about what to expect from Whitehall, and how to respond. “My advice is, ‘If you want to do something new, set up a new unit, and recruit. You’ll get people joining who want to do new things.” But Benn’s experience at the department of industry suggest that outflanking Whitehall’s conservatives may not be that simple.And then there is the business establishment. Since Thatcher, it has become accustomed to deferential governments, to getting its own way over other interest groups, and to profits and share prices trumping other measures of a company’s economic or social value. The intention of the new economists to end these imbalances has not gone down well. “The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) really hates inclusive ownership,” says one McDonnell ally. “You can feel the chill whenever we bring it up.”When I asked the CBI for their thoughts on the new economics, there was a week-long silence, and then, after I chased them, a terse statement: “Labour seems determined to impose rules that display a wilful misunderstanding of business.”The new economists say they are not intimidated. “We in the movement need to be absolutely frank about this,” says Guinan. “A democratic and an exploitative economy are fundamentally incompatible. We should mount a straightforward, left-populist attack on these business interests. We should say to them: ‘Off you go to Singapore!’ The left shouldn’t be afraid of a little creative destruction”, he says, cheekily borrowing a phrase usually used by free-marketeers. Jacobs agrees: “Exploitative companies can go to the wall.”That might sound like a reckless leftwing fantasy. But the new economists argue convincingly that hugely disruptive change is coming to the British economy, anyway – thanks to Brexit, automation and the climate emergency. “Brexit alone will require a very interventionist state” to help the economy adapt, says Lawrence. “It will make it much harder for a civil servant to say, ‘You simply can’t do that.’”But what do the new economists want to come after neoliberal capitalism? In Preston, after Brown had spoken evangelically to me about the virtues of “local businesses” and “local jobs”, I asked whether his council was actually saving capitalism in the city – by making it more socially sensitive – rather than supplanting it. For once, he paused. “We’ve got to be pragmatic,” he said. “We are still in a free-market environment. And I don’t see local businesses as big capitalists, anyway. The vast majority only have one or two people working for them. There’s almost no one to exploit. Shareholders are not involved.” Not everyone on the left would see small businesses – often keen supporters of rightwing parties and austere social and economic policies – in such benign terms. But Brown went on: “The Labour party, nationally, is getting away from the old pro-businessanti-business argument. Creating social value is what matters.”Later I asked McDonnell, too, whether his approach risked saving rather than replacing capitalism. He smiled, and went into the gnomic mode he adopts when talking about tricky issues. “Who incorporates who ...” he said. “That’s the debate!” Then his smile turned more mischievous. A Corbyn government, he said, would “welcome” business “into our warm embrace”.The McDonnell ally I spoke to said that whenever the question of the economy’s long-term trajectory came up in Labour discussions, “We avoid that conversation. There is no consensus in the party.” Then he added: “Personally, I’d be quite happy if Britain ended up as Denmark.”McDonnell often cites Germany as another country where capitalism is more benign. Wainwright, who has known McDonnell for decades, has a usefully flexible prediction about what might happen to Britain’s economic culture if he becomes chancellor. “En route to a socialist society,” she says, “there might be moments when a different capitalism emerges” – ie, a more benign one.Yet the problem for the left with settling for “a different capitalism”, however temporarily, is that it may simply enable capitalism to regroup, and then resume its Darwinian progress. Arguably this is exactly what happened in Britain during the last century. After the politically explosive economic slump of the 1930s – the precursor to today’s crisis of capitalism – during the postwar years many business leaders seemed to accept the need for a more egalitarian economy, and developed close relationships with Labour politicians. But once the economy and society had been stabilised, and rightwingers such as Thatcher started making a seductive case for a return to raw capitalism, the businessmen switched sides.Another difficulty for the new economists and their political allies is to persuade voters – brought up with the idea that profit and growth are the only economic outcomes that matter – that other values should matter more from now on. Even saving the environment is still a hard sell. “The effect of economic growth on the planet is not an issue that’s talked about nearly enough on the left,” admits Berry. “As for de-growth” – the current green term for dropping growth as an economic objective – “the Labour party won’t touch it with a bargepole.” McDonnell’s ally agreed. “De-growth,” he said, “is just appalling labelling.” Guinan says the problem is not just presentational: “a politics of de-growth has not yet been invented that will carry the public.”Instead, Labour have recently begun promoting a version of the Green New Deal: an enticing but still largely theoretical scheme advocated by steadily more leftists and environmentalists in Britain and the US over the past decade. It aims to address the climate emergency and some of capitalism’s problems simultaneously, by a huge increase in government support for green technologies and the highly skilled, hopefully well-paid jobs needed to create them. In a speech this week, McDonnell said that this project needed to be Britain’s biggest peacetime undertaking since the Attlee government’s conversion of the economy from war to peace during the 40s. In April, the shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, a McDonnell protege, wrote a  article advocating a “green industrial revolution”, including “deep-water turbines in the North Sea”, which “could provide four times Europe’s entire electricity demand” and “could be built and delivered from the UK”. It was quite a thrilling vision but the turbines were the only potential new technology the article mentioned.Another enormous issue that the new economists often skirt is whether many of today’s workers really want more of a voice in their workplaces. When “industrial democracy” was last a popular idea on the left, in the 70s, work was arguably more fulfilling and central to people’s lives than it had ever been before. Office jobs were replacing factory jobs, work was a strong engine of social mobility, and membership of powerful trade unions had accustomed the majority of British employees to being consulted, of having some agency in their working lives. But in 2019, empowering experiences at work are less common. For more and more people, however well-qualified, employment is short-term, low-status, unrewarding – barely part of their identity at all.Gordon-Farleigh has spent years trying to interest people in forming co-operatives, and not always succeeding. “Contemporary capitalism has produced a pacified, passive workforce,” he says. “A lot of people even like to feel a bit alienated by capitalism – to not really understand how it works. They need to be reskilled, politically. Then we have to look at what economic powers they actually want.”In April, after waiting for a pause in the seemingly endless winter of Brexit arguments, Mathew Lawrence launched a new economics thinktank, Common Wealth, which aims to draw all the strands of the movement together, with an evening event in London. After an uplifting but slightly too slick film about Common Wealth’s mission had been shown on a big screen – which was similar in tone and content to a recent Labour party political broadcast called Our Town – Lawrence was introduced to the audience by Guinan. In the speech that followed, Lawrence covered so much ground that his voice became a mutter, too fast for anyone unfamiliar with the new economics to follow. During this formal bit of the evening, Common Wealth risked feeling like a project for insiders – just another London thinktank, with the former Labour leader Ed Miliband on its board.Yet the rest of the launch felt different. The hired room was in the East End, far from the usual thinktank belt around Westminster, and it was packed, and loud with earnest talk. Almost everyone was in their 20s or 30s, many of them with scuffed Dr Martens shoes and austere modern haircuts – the now-familiar sight of British millennials gathering to discuss changing the world. Two hours after the start of the event, people were still arriving, and hardly anyone had left. When I did, just before 11, the lights were still on in the nearby office towers of the City of London, which overshadows the East End, and the economy of the whole country beyond. But walking away from the buzzing room, especially after a bottle of the Common Wealth craft ale that had been made for the occasion, it was possible to believe that the bankers’ best days might be numbered, and that the new economics would tell us how.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89bd34edf31e3ce578b8331849149e98bbfdd0f5/0_657_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d4e468f0f60a84fbeeab6f2232beb2d","title":"jeremy hunt pulls foreign office support nicola sturgeon","story":"Tory leadership candidate accused of playing politics with move against first ministerJeremy Hunt has been accused of trying to boost his Conservative leadership campaign by withdrawing Foreign Office (FCO) support for Nicola Sturgeon’s overseas visits.The foreign secretary has confirmed that he has ordered his department not to provide any official or consular support for Sturgeon’s trips abroad if she uses them to campaign for Scottish independence.The row first erupted when the FCO refused to support Sturgeon’s trip to Brussels to meet Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, and Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, two weeks ago. The first minister gave a speech attacking Brexit and extolling her government’s pro-EU, pro-independence stance.Hunt has told the Scottish Daily Mail during a leadership campaign visit to Scotland that the policy would affect Sturgeon’s future tours and visits, although he indicated it would apply primarily if Scotland’s constitutional future was on the agenda.“I believe in the union with every fibre of my being and British government policy is to protect, preserve, cherish and enhance that union,” Hunt said. “So we are not going to offer support to Nicola Sturgeon if she goes abroad to drum up support for independence.”Sturgeon’s official spokesman said it was extraordinary for a candidate for prime minister to withdraw support offered to every devolved administration and minister, while at the same time claiming to be protecting the UK as whole.Hunt’s stance was “the most visible way possible of making the arguments for independence”.He added: “It would be naive to think this was nothing to do with the Tory leadership race.”Sturgeon’s trip to Brussels was not directly affected because the Scottish government has its own external affairs office in the Belgian capital, he said it would be considered much more serious if the policy affected future trips to other countries.She has been on FCO-supported trade visits to China, the US, Canada and other countries, frequently collaborating with Scottish universities, as well as technology and whisky companies and other business bodies.However, on trips to Brussels, Dublin and North America she has given speeches and media interviews that focused heavily on her government’s objections to Brexit and her quest for independence, including plans to potentially rejoin the EU in future.“Let’s wait and see exactly how official or otherwise this is, or if this is a flash-in-the-pan leadership pitch from Jeremy Hunt which fizzles out. The jury is out on that one,” her spokesman said.“Longer term, of course we would be concerned if the Scottish government was not to be afforded the same level of representation as the rest of the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/342405d93b53cab28eb5de1d6348820a3d85af60/57_76_1796_1078/master/1796.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c38d0ae69abed2d56167c4c1e70c9e78","title":"labour holds back on second referendum amid shadow cabinet rift","story":"Labour frontbenchers frustrated by failure to agree next step on Brexit strategyA tense meeting of Labour’s shadow cabinet failed to agree any advance on the party’s position on a second Brexit referendum, despite several senior figures saying they had been led to believe Jeremy Corbyn would soon give full-throated backing for remain.Corbyn is understood to have told shadow cabinet ministers there would be further consultation with the unions and a decision on the next step taken in the coming weeks, to the frustration of several present including the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell.Sources in the room said McDonnell had said he was “under the impression we were making the decision today” on how to advance Labour’s position. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, also questioned why a decision was not being taken and said it was “about showing leadership”.Several shadow cabinet members emerged from last week’s meeting believing the party would agree a new strategy on Tuesday, after Corbyn had consulted trade union leaders.Speaking at a car industry conference on Tuesday, McDonnell was asked directly if the Labour party was campaigning for a second referendum, replying: “Well, I’m arguing the case … The discussion we are having in the Labour party now, and it is no secret, is what would our attitude be if there is a referendum?”“I’ve said personally, I’d vote for remain. I campaigned for remain because I can’t see anything better than what we have got at the moment. I can see the consequences in terms of jobs and living standards.”McDonnell said the party’s policy would “evolve over the next week or so because there are more party consultations”.Phil Wilson, a backer of the People’s Vote campaign who has co-led attempts in parliament to put any Brexit deal to a referendum, said the delay was damaging the party.“Labour members and Labour MPs expect our party to have a clear policy that reflects our values,” he said. “Instead, we have to listen to muddle, confusion and the sound of the can being kicked listlessly down a never-ending road. The longer this dithering goes on, the more damage will be done to our party.”The shadow cabinet rift comes amid concerns about a summer of potential selection battles after MPs were given a fortnight to decide whether they wished to stand again for parliament – a sign that the party is preparing for a snap election.MPs suggested it could make the party impossible to manage, with frontbenchers among those expressing concern they could be deselected.“We could end up in a situation where frontbench Labour MPs are deselected and have to serve for another three years knowing they will have to go at the next election,” one MP said. “How does that serve the party or help departmental teams develop a manifesto? How can whips manage a party where 20 MPs may have been deselected? Either senior Labour people know this and don’t care or they don’t realise. That is very worrying.”MPs expressed anger at the timetable at a private meeting of Labour MPs on Monday night. The chair of the parliamentary Labour party, Jon Cryer, told the meeting it was a “rushed job” to give MPs only two weeks to decide whether to stand again when they would normally be notified well in advance.Many MPs have also questioned the need for such a short timeframe, with several contrasting it with the leadership’s apparent unwillingness to ballot members on a change of Brexit policy, as proposed by the deputy leader, Tom Watson.“It’s striking that, in this time of political chaos, our leadership can’t agree to give members a ballot on Brexit and what our policy should be, but can make time to push for them to happen on deselections of MPs – I know which I would rather be fighting,” one MP said.Party rules were changed in September to make it easier for a local party to “trigger” a selection contest, rather than automatically re-adopting the sitting MP.Several MPs said they had already begun the groundwork preparing for trigger ballots, but warned that reselection battles would take huge amounts of time and energy. “This is money and time that could go into holding my marginal seat at snap election,” one MP said.Another called the new procedure “a massive distraction”.The flashpoints where party sources said MPs are most at risk of selection battles include Thangam Debbonaire’s seat in Bristol West and a number of seats around Merseyside and the north-west, including the seats of Maria and Angela Eagle and Louise Ellman.Roger Godsiff, the MP who has defended parents’ rights to take their children out of LGBT-inclusive lessons, and Kate Hoey, who has voted consistently with hard Brexiters in parliament, could also face local difficulty if they decide to stand again.It is unclear what would be the fate of two Labour MPs who are suspended from the party and are under investigation – Chris Williamson and Kelvin Hopkins. When the snap election was called in 2017, the suspended Labour MP Simon Danczuk was deselected.At least two Labour MPs who have previously rebelled to back efforts to deliver Brexit, Jim Fitzpatrick and Ronnie Campbell, have already announced they will not seek re-election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c35abe0a23cd9ad59c3088269399dc691a7f2aab/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6f163dcc5ecb1d9c9dcd4d7f609fb3b","title":"two child benefit limit pushes families further into poverty study","story":"Parents report stress and strained relationships as a result of benefit cutThe government’s two-child limit on benefits is having a devastating impact on family life as it pushes millions of children deeper into poverty, according to the first detailed study of the benefit cut.Nearly all families affected by the limit reported cutting back on essentials such as food, medication, heating and clothing as a result of the policy, which makes them miss out on at least £53 a week in benefits support.Many parents reported stress and strained family relationships, as well as shame and guilt at being unable to provide for their children. Several women said they had considered terminations because of fears over the impact on family finances.Interviews with women experiencing domestic abuse suggested that the two-child limit was regarded as a financial barrier for women and children trying to escape an abusive relationship and created “stark choices between poverty and safety”.The limit, introduced in April 2017, restricts the child element in universal credit and tax credits worth £2,780 per child per year to the first two children. The government has championed the policy, which will cut the benefits bill by £1bn a year by 2021, as an incentive for people on benefits to work.However, official figures show most families affected are already in work, while the study found those affected felt strongly that the two-child limit unfairly punished hard-working low income families at a time – the birth of a child – when they most needed support.One mother told researchers: “The safety net doesn’t exist any more for my family … You feel really distressed that you have turned to the welfare state and that there is nothing available for you and now I must turn to charity. What am I paying taxes for?”Alison Garnham, the chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, which published the report along with the Church of England, called for the two-child limit to be abolished. “We wouldn’t turn away a sick child from our hospitals or stop them going to school and yet the two-child limit denies families the support they need from our social security system when they experience tough times, trapping kids in poverty,” she said.The limit will push an additional 300,000 children into poverty by 2024, while 1 million children already below the breadline will be pushed into deeper hardship, the report says. To date an estimated 160,000 families and 600,000 children have been affected, and this could rise to 1.8 million young people over the next five years.Ministers have defended the policy on the basis that it forces parents to take responsibility for their choices and teaches them that “children cost money”. However, the study says the policy has been barely publicised by government, and only half those affected were aware of it before they became pregnant.Many women interviewed said their third child had been unplanned. For them, the study noted, “the only way to exercise choice would have been to have a termination, which some of the women simply would not contemplate for moral or emotional reasons and which those in Northern Ireland would have been unable to access even if they had wanted to.”Relatively few claimants appeared to have used a “rape clause” covering a third or subsequent child conceived as a result of sexual assault.“The overriding picture emerging from both the survey and interview findings is that families affected by the two-child limit are facing severe and ongoing financial difficulty, which cannot be overcome through careful budgeting or just ‘tightening their belts’, but instead leads to real deprivation,” the report says.A government spokesperson said: “This policy helps to ensure fairness by asking parents receiving benefits to face the same financial choices as those in work. Safeguards are in place and we’ve made changes this year to make the policy fairer.”This year the government cancelled much-criticised plans to extend the two-child policy in universal credit to children born before the policy was introduced. It exempted kinship carers after the high court found last year that the policy as it affected this group was “perverse and unlawful”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf9ac7dd7fbef2e34255dfa9f2d12aa46ae728b/0_0_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=322c564e6bcfd1d080052154fd72684a","title":"andy murray doubles defeat eastbourne evans konta tennis","story":"Dan Evans has had quite the summer, climbing the rankings into the comfort zone where he does not have to qualify for the slams, a stage where his talent deserves to be seen regularly after too long idling on the fringes.If Andy Murray epitomises artful struggle – and the Scot’s first stumble in his comeback here on Tuesday, when the excellent Juan Sebastián Cabal and Robert Farah beat him and Marcelo Melo 6-2, 6-4 in just over an hour, was not a seismic shock – Evans is the hero of the artful dodgers, a reformed rebel with educated hands and a quick brain.Hardcourt is the surface that suits his game best, but grass is not far behind, and he showed enough deft touches in beating the Moldovan clay-courter Radu Albot 7-6 (2), 6-2 in the first round of the Nature Valley International to suggest he will surprise a few people at Wimbledon next week.Murray’s return to Wimbledon after an absence of a year is hugely anticipated, but it will be with his third partner in as many weeks, the Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert, having lifted the Queen’s trophy on Sunday with Feliciano López. That is a lot of adjustment to make when he goes back on court next week.He also said he would probably decide on Wednesday whether or not to play mixed doubles at Wimbledon. “You get a couple of bad days of rain, you can end up having to play best-of-five doubles followed by a mixed doubles,” he said. “That can happen a couple of days in a row. I need to be certain that I’m ready to do that. I think I should be OK.”While Murray hit some wondrous shots in defeat under gathering clouds on Tuesday evening, the Colombians – whom Murray and López had beaten in the first round at Queen’s – were too organised, grooved and disciplined.That could describe the transformation in Evans’s tennis over the past year. He was still rebuilding his interesting career when, ranked 342 in the world, he lost in the second round of qualifying at Wimbledon to the 32-year-old German Matthias Bachinger. Next week, now ranked 65, he is in the main draw by right – and in form.Before losing to Stan Wawrinka in the first round at Queen’s last week, Evans had won 10 matches in a row on grass. The best he has done at the All England Club in four visits was reaching the third round in 2016, where Roger Federer was waiting for him.After beating Albot, the world No 41, in an entertaining hour and 48 minutes on the Centre Court at the lovely Devonshire Park club, he said: “I like the grass. There are quite a few who don’t like the grass, so it gives me an advantage in that way.” He is looking forward to Wimbledon rather than regarding it as an obstacle to his progress. Here he saved nine of 10 break points and got out of trouble with some precise serving and solid groundstrokes.However, there is a problem with tournaments a week before a slam: they are a week before a slam – and that can place self-preservation ahead of ambition. Evans does not see it that way. He wants ranking points. “I got plenty of time last week to look after myself,” he said. “I can’t pick and choose my tournaments yet. So it’s a great week for me here to try and get some points on the board again.”Cameron Norrie, meanwhile, set up an all-British second-round match with Kyle Edmund after beating Jérémy Chardy, 6-3, 7-6 (4). The artful Frenchman lost in five to sets to Edmund, the British No 1, on the clay of Roland Garros last month, but his sting was drawn on the teasing grass of Eastbourne. The winner could play Evans, if the Birmingham player gets past Herbert in the next round. The Frenchman beat the American Denis Kudla 5-7, 7-6 (8), 6-4.Britain’s No 1 woman, Johanna Konta, looked solid again as she looks to put her Roland Garros semi-final disappointment behind her, although there were some anxious moments at 3-5 in the second set before she got the better of the promising Greek Maria Sakkari 6-4, 7-6 (4). “Our points felt that she was playing better than me,” Konta admitted, “so I was really pleased that I was able to stay with her. It could have easily gone to a third set. I definitely wasn’t taking anything for granted out there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18c9a3c0742b6dd3530675e4ca173e95222e1f1/1606_143_4943_2966/master/4943.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b39809e6ea26e697d98d1ae197a14d54","title":"betfred refuse punter 189000 pounds after mistake betting slip horse racing","story":"• Gambler will take case to arbitration in claim for £212,000• Punter says was told bet would be settled on intended wagerA bookmaker has refused to pay £189,000 to a punter who made a mistake in writing out a six-horse accumulator and included Bailarico, who finished third, rather than Bialco, a winner. David Smith, a 60-year-old from Loughborough, still received £23,000 from his spectacularly successful choices on that day a fortnight ago but contends that Betfred should have paid him £212,000 and plans to take the matter to the arbitrator Ibas.Smith’s other five selections in the bet all won: Ardera Cross (40-1), Indian Temple (7-1), Shanroe (9-2), Pennsylvania Dutch (15-2) and Sir Busker (4-1). He argues that he clearly intended to include Bialco, as he wrote “2.15 P” next to Bailarico’s name. Bialco won the 2.15pm race at Perth, whereas Bailarico was third in the 3.40pm at Goodwood. Smith also wrote down the odds that were being offered about Bialco at the time.Smith says he returned to the shop during the afternoon’s racing, after two of his horses had won. Upon checking his slip, he realised his error and explained it to shop staff, at a time when Bialco had won but Bailarico had yet to race. He says he was assured that the bet would be settled on Bialco and that the decision in the shop, after the other horses had won, was to settle it at £212,000. But when the bet was referred to Betfred security for authorisation the settlement was changed to £23,000.A Betfred spokesman told the : “Unfortunately the customer had written Bailarico on his slip which was running in a race at Goodwood that day and finished third. Our rules state that we settle on the named selection.”Smith said: “I’m not happy about the way they handled my complaint. There was nobody to explain what really happened.” A regular in the Loughborough shop, he feels sure that his bet would have been corrected at the time of being placed if the manager, who knows him well, had been working and had checked his bet as normal.Smith is being assisted by Paul Fairhead, an online campaigner for punters, who points to another Betfred rule allowing the firm to split stakes between two horses if a bet is deemed ambiguous. Applied in Smith’s case, that would give him an additional payout of approximately £90,000."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a68db4d8b0628d016c7dbbea6422a590f26fe6c/182_14_2889_1733/master/2889.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e04ec29d77c9b6038d562633f013d351","title":"england australia cricket world cup lords","story":"Welcome back then, England. It’s been a while. Just not, as it happens, quite long enough.On a sullen, grey day at Lord’s England were both oddly meek and jarringly aggressive en route to a comprehensive 64-run defeat by Australia that leaves their World Cup campaign, at best, intriguingly poised.This could still end in glory. The tournament is still there to be won. Even if England have looked anything but favourites while failing twice to reach 230 as the pressure has begun to ratchet up. For all the fear of dead rubbers, we are instead being treated to the equally gripping spectacle of an uncrowned champion team losing their nerve, cracking and flaking a little as the endgame approaches.This was a game that died in stages for England. The decisive cut came in a moment of brilliance from a man who knows quite a lot about peaking at the right time.At 5.20pm Mitchell Starc came back to bowl his sixth over from the Nursery end. In the morning Australia had batted doggedly to post 285 for seven after losing the toss. In reply England were already paddling: behind the run rate, five wickets down, but still just about alive.Mainly they had Ben Stokes, who had batted beautifully to reach 88 at the start of that over, and with some controlled rage, too, in an innings that had threatened to wilt.Starc came in off that long bounding run and produced five full-pitched rockets that jarred the toe of the bat. The sixth killed the game. It was a thing of beauty, too, a full pitcher that angled in to Stokes, opening him up to clip it to leg, then veered away in the last five yards of its trajectory, sliding past the outside edge to detonate his stumps. Stokes dropped his bat, kicked it, stared at the grass as around him the yellow shirts whooped and leapt and hugged.Oh, England. For the last two years this blue machine has swaggered through its ODI cricket, playing only in the high gears, facing only forward, never taking a step that wasn’t forward: and aggressively forward, too, all the while talking about how step-like its steps are, how aggressive its aggression.Change the parts, change the brand, change the chat. Talk, by all means, with unsmiling defiance in press conferences about playing one way and not feeling pressure and fearing no one. But this is still England, a country of great but circumscribed resources.And more to the point, this is England at a 50-over World Cup that the ECB has built towards for four years, pinning on this team the idea of somehow resuscitating the sport itself, bursting out of those self-drawn boundaries. No pressure then.It was Starc here who exposed the weak spots. James Vince emerged to lead the chase with an air of precooked doom about him. There is presumably such a thing as a good second-ball duck. This was not one of them. Vince blocked the first ball of the innings. The second from Jason Behrendorff was fuller, swinging in just a little. At which point the day began to fall apart. Vince went to drive grandly, expansively, loosely through wide midwicket. Instead he found fresh air.Next Starc ripped out England’s red- and white-ball captains with two contrasting pieces of brilliance First was Joe Root, who played forward to a ball on middle and off that stayed on middle and off, stayed a bit longer, then veered at the last into his pad. It was followed by something more brutal.Eoin Morgan had already skipped out to Behrendorff and battered him through mid-off, a wild shot reminiscent of man at a boozy afternoon picnic swatting flies with a tennis racket. He’d faced three balls from Starc and hopped at each of them.The fourth was directed at the bridge of his nose. He flailed, windmilling round after the ball and Pat Cummins took the catch. It was simply too much for Morgan, whose last first-class match saw him bat No 6 here against Lancashire. Few activities can prepare you for Starc at his thrilling best. It seems fairly certain this isn’t one of them.From there the innings unravelled. Jonny Bairstow played well before hitting the ball up in the air. Chris Woakes played well before hitting the ball up in the air. Adil Rashid played well before hitting the ball up in the air. Jofra Archer cut to the chase and simply hit the ball up in the air.Does this England team deserve to win a World Cup? If there is a shared quality that defines this era, the age of the self‑governing blue Lycra juggernaut, it is a sense of detachment. England batted here and at Leeds like a team detached from the reality of the day and the game, out there floating in their tin can, high above the world. This is our brand. We are not what went before. We go one way, and that way (have we mentioned?) is forward.England will be called brainless, feckless, flat-track and all the rest. But the key note of the last two defeats has been detachment, an inability to read the day, the game, the forces acting on them.It could yet end in glory. That needle could simply hit the groove again. But it will take something more than we have so far seen a test of more than just those brittle methods, but of character too, in some unplanned adversity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb8c1488c78b6f0a4a277fe5f60248e9e5c9d671/0_71_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7506b6bc0dc8c9f772012a07534de228","title":"facebook libra cryptocurrency regulation","story":"Chair of Financial Stability Board says company’s plans could spark closer scrutiny of cryptocurrenciesFacebook’s Libra cryptocurrency is facing increasing skepticism from international regulators days after ambitious plans for it were unveiled by the social media company.On Tuesday, Randal Quarles, chair of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), a policy coordinator for G20 countries, said Facebook’s plan to expand into retail payments could lead regulators to take a closer look at such financial instruments.Quarles’s comments mark the first time a senior US regulator has spoken of how they might approach Libra, which aims to transform the global payments markets.Quarles said that while the board did not plan to discuss the issue at this week’s G20 summit in Japan and “crypto-assets” like Libra did not currently pose a risk to global financial stability, he envisioned gaps where they fall outside the remit of regulators and the oversight of international standards.“A wider use of new types of crypto-assets for retail payment purposes would warrant close scrutiny by authorities to ensure that they are subject to high standards of regulation,” Quarles said in a letter released ahead of the summit and first reported by Reuters.Quarles added: “The FSB and standard setting bodies will monitor risks very closely and in a co-ordinated fashion, and consider additional multilateral responses as needed.”The remarks follow an agreement in March 2018 by G20 finance ministers and central bankers to monitor crypto-assets. The FSB has said if Libra takes off, a different regulatory response will be needed.Quarles remarks follow a statement from the Bank for International Settlements on Sunday that politicians need to move rapidly to coordinate regulatory responses to any new risks.The FSB’s interjection over Facebook’s Libra, which is backed by more than 20 international institutions including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber and could launch as soon as next year, come as the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority said it would not allow the social media company the digital currency without close scrutiny.Andrew Bailey, the head of the UK’s FCA, confirmed on Tuesday that the organization was working with the UK Treasury and the Bank of England to monitor Facebook’s plans.The FSB and the FCA have joined Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, in alerting Facebook that if its plan to attract users to a new currency are successful “it would instantly become systemic and will have to be subject to the highest standards of regulation”.The European Union’s head of financial stability, Olivier Guersent, said ahead of Libra’s unveiling that Facebook’s potential concentration of both personal and financial data needed attention from regulators."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/485d484522298e983ce6ef36c8191791955aa0be/0_191_2832_1699/master/2832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae8294d6c752fab237cfeb5774a3b3cd","title":"drag sos review family gorgeous makeover show","story":"In a somewhat confusing makeover show, the Family Gorgeous, a troupe of Mancunian drag artists, tour the UK to bring fabulousness to people struggling with self-esteemDo you believe there is a little bit of fabulous in all of us? I do not. In fact, I know there is not, because I exist and I check myself optimistically for signs of nascent fabulosity every week nary a glimmer do I find. But I hope it is true for everyone else. I want it to be true. And so I hope the Family Gorgeous, the troupe of drag queens around whom the new reality show Drag SOS (Channel 4) is structured (poorly, but we will get to that), might find it in their expansive hearts to let me in regardless.Lill, Asttina Mandella, Cheddar Gorgeous, Anna Phylactic, TeTe Bang and Donna Trump are visions of colourful, confected loveliness. Their makeup, costumes and wigs are monuments to the phenomenal artistry it takes to drag up well. This applies equally to Liquorice Black, but in monochrome – a little aniseed bite amid the delicious bag of pick’n’mix sweeties they evoke.After a decade of RuPaul’s Drag Race, drag is now virtually mainstream, particularly on the other side of the Atlantic, where the crowned queens of that series can expect to go on to lucrative careers that increasingly include gigs such as Starbucks and McDonald’s adverts and their own makeup lines.Our Mancunian gang, however, have set their sights a little more locally: they are on a mission to bring glamour, cheer and maybe even a little liberation to the hidebound folk of England at a rate of three punters an episode.In the opening episode, there is Abby, a 33-year-old single mother of two children with ADHD 21-year-old art student Nico, who has experienced bulimia and a mental breakdown that has taken her from extrovertion to rock-bottom self-esteem and Shaun. Shaun is the father of Owen, who came out to his parents a few years ago in his teens. “I had pretty caveman thoughts,” says Shaun. “What did I do wrong? Did he have an experience at school that turned him gay? That’s where I was.” Now he is eager to take part in the project to bond with Owen, who has a drag persona of his own, and to make up for all the times he tried to interest the boy in his own hobbies of football and … well, just football really.After the introductions, however, it all becomes a bit messy the producers try to do too much at once, unable to decide whether it is a general makeover show, a specific look at the construction and benefits of drag or a full-on emotional rollercoaster following the punters’ and the queens’ journeys. The result is something that falls unsatisfactorily between three stools.The most inspiring story – of Shaun and his relationship with Owen – is frustratingly obscured by unnecessary clips of the searches for other potential dragees and other filler. There are some very touching moments between Shaun and Anna. Anna sees in Sean the ability to let love overcome difference that she does not seem to have experienced with her own father – but the differences are left unexplored. The transformations and final performances arrive almost out of the blue and with no sense of what the art has brought to life.It seems a waste of a lot of material – and of unusually articulate presenters – that was clearly there and just needed shaping into something meaningful. What did remain, however, was the sense of an enterprise suffused with kindness. The queens so obviously had each others’ backs in everything, and were out – in public and in private with their protegees – to share the benefits drag has brought them. That kindness, the essential gentleness with which the whole venture was approached was a rare enough treat in reality-show terms, which are too often some variant of bullying, and deeply welcome when set against the wider backdrop of current events.There’s a wider conversation to be had, I suspect, about what may be lost when a counterculture like drag becomes culture – does it destroy a space for certain sensibilities, or create a wider one? Does everyone really win when performance art becomes commerce? Does it mean that all forms of drag become acceptable or does it mean the rise of only one approved sort? And where does that leave the rest? But for here and now, Drag SOS certainly does no harm and even if it only creates a little space for kindness on our screens, it may do some good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc62777de46c7a280f22b26e5743fdf5da97ec97/0_245_7443_4466/master/7443.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a8ec359fdc0f9f3a7800d96885616b7","title":"rylan clark neal i knew i had to be the gay stereotype i played the game","story":"The broadcaster found fame after his hysterical performance on The X Factor, but he has gone from national joke to national treasure – even if celebrity isn’t all it was cracked up to beAt his home in Essex, Rylan Clark-Neal has an assortment of flatscreen TVs all tuned to his current favourite reality TV show. No, not Love Island – BBC Parliament.“It’s such a load of bollocks, I love it!” he says. “Have you ever sat there and watched it on a Wednesday? It’s hil-air-ious ... how prime minister’s question time is not a show on terrestrial TV I have no idea. I’ve never seen more liars in one room!”Channel controllers take note – after all, nobody understands reality TV quite like Clark-Neal. The 30-year-old first came to most people’s attention in 2012 as an outrageously camp contestant on ITV’s The X Factor who couldn’t really sing, but had a talent for annoying the judge Gary Barlow (and charming viewers in the process). A triumphant turn on Channel 5’s Celebrity Big Brother followed, which led to a presenter’s gig on the spin-off show, Big Brother’s Bit on the Side, then a stint as a showbiz reporter on ITV’s This Morning. Having completed a remarkable journey from national joke to national treasure, he can be heard in our front rooms in the Saturday afternoon BBC Radio 2 slot previously occupied by Zoe Ball. He says he has to pinch himself daily.“Yesterday I went to interview Madonna tonight I’m going to the Spice Girls, because Geri got me a ticket,” he says, by way of explaining his dreams coming true. Or, to put it another way: “Basically, 10-year-old me is having a wank.”Today we are sitting in a quiet meeting room overlooking Regent’s canal in London. Clark-Neal, who admits that he spent the photoshoot grilling the photographer about who would be interviewing him (“I needed to check you weren’t an arsehole”), gleams so brightly that you worry about staring directly at him: not just because of the bright-white veneers, which cost him £25,000 in 2013, but thanks to the brilliant-blue eyes, too. He is funny – outspoken and outrageous. Yet there is a steeliness and seriousness to him (not to mention a sweariness). After years of doing staged showbiz interviews full of made-up anecdotes, there is a sense of catharsis to his conversation: “It’s nice to be honest for a change,” he says, before talking about his early years being bullied, the time off he took at the end of 2017 and the dawning realisation that fame hasn’t turned out to be all he had hoped.Recently, he has turned his attention to another serious matter, one that may surprise those who know him best as the X Factor contestant who had a histrionic meltdown when Nicole Scherzinger told him she was putting him through to the live finals. “I’m obsessed with Brexit,” he says. Then, to prove his political knowledge, he performs an unlikely impression of the Labour MP Dawn Butler telling the Tory front bench to shush (“She’s my favourite she lets the MP mask slip”).So, what is his analysis of the Brexit impasse?“That all roads lead to shit. Every single possible outcome will cause riots. Whatever your position, whatever you voted, even if you get what you want, it’s still gonna be shit.”Could he do a better job?“I often think I could do a better job. Honestly, there are harder decisions to make during a series of Celebrity Big Brother than the ones they’re having to make.”Clark-Neal credits his time in Big Brother with changing the public’s perception of him – “they realised I was normal” – and his adoration goes so deep that he has modelled his house on the set. Apparently, there are Big Brother “eyes” above each door and the garden has been landscaped by people who worked on the show. Sadly, he says: “The only place I’ve ever felt safe is the Big Brother house.” His house even has a diary room for him to sit in. What does he do in there?“Think,” he says. “And talk.”“I can make someone listen if I want to.”“I can set it up so other people in the house can listen ... if I want them to.” He looks slightly bashful. “I live in quite a smart home. I built it from scratch, so I thought of everything ... a lot of my doors are automatic the whole house is voice-activated.”The other day, his wifi went down. He is a little embarrassed to admit that he had forgotten how to turn on the lights like a normal person. “I was pressing random buttons and screaming for Alexa to help.”As if to prove his hi-tech credentials, his watch suddenly starts buzzing to tell him his stepson, Cameron, is trying to call – in 2015, Clark-Neal married Dan Neal, a former police officer and Big Brother contestant, whose 19-year-old son now lives with them. “Do you mind?” he says, reaching for his phone. There follows an amusing conversation revolving around Cameron trying to access the house’s steam room. “If you go for a swim, be careful of the robot – it’s on a cleaning cycle. Oh, and dry the floor after yourself!”How does he find being a stepdad?“It’s the same as being a normal dad. He rinses me dry, I slap him about when he’s naughty ... no, I don’t, obviously … but it’s the same as being a biological dad. He lives with us. I moan at him to clean up, he cleans up ... he cuts the grass, I give him some money ... it’s just very normal.”Clark-Neal describes himself as the man in the middle – there are 10 years between he and both Dan and Cameron – but the closeness in age helps him with some difficult conversations. “I don’t like to talk about sex with Cameron, but I can,” he says. “But I do warn him – if you make me a grandad at 30, I’ll cut it off.”Would he like more children?“It’s not something I really talk about – although it always ends up in the papers anyway. But Dan’s done it all now, whereas I haven’t. So … I don’t know.”Clark-Neal was born Ross Richard Clark in 1988, raised by his mum and his nan in a council house in Stepney Green, east London. He says his childhood was a happy, normal one, but he was bullied: “Of course I was – I was a chubby, ginger, gay kid: all I needed was a set of glasses for the full fucking set.”There was a real community spirit on his street, but his mum moved the family to Essex after he was attacked at a local playground and put in hospital with a fractured skull. “Probably because they thought I was gay, although I don’t remember any of it. One minute I was on the rope swings, the next I was on the floor.”Seeing two women bloodied and beaten in the news recently after an attack on a London bus, alleged to have been motivated by homophobia, didn’t surprise him: “I saw all the statuses saying: ‘I can’t believe this is happening in 2019,’ but every day on my Twitter feed I’ll get: ‘You’re gay, you’re a cunt, people like you should be killed because you’re gay.’ Will things ever change?”In his teens, Clark-Neal dabbled in modelling, changing his name from Ross to Rylan to be more recognisable. He performed in boyband tribute acts, then signed up to The X Factor. But he doesn’t like looking back on that period of his life.“I played a character when I was on there,” he says. “I knew I had to be the gay stereotype that was on the front of the papers every day. And I did my job well. I played the game.”Does this mean that his hysterical crying in front of Scherzinger was all an act?“No, that was true,” he says. “But only because we were drinking in the pool until about 7am and it was 50-degree heat and I’d had an hour’s sleep. I knew I only needed a week on the live shows to earn a bit of money and set myself up for a while. But you only saw a bit of the crying. It went on for 45 minutes and they had to call a paramedic. I couldn’t breathe!”Clark-Neal says he watches the infamous clip once a year, just to remind himself how much it all means. He loves his job and he has worked ridiculously hard for it – possibly too much, at times. He recalls the day his nan died. They were incredibly close, but he still chose to present Big Brother’s Bit on the Side that night. “It was either that or sit indoors crying,” he says. “So I cried, went into work, had another cry, did an hour’s live show, then cried and went home. It’s just how I am ... always at work, never stop.”Does he worry that he is using work to deal with deeper stuff?“One hundred per cent. But I know my nan would have said: ‘Go to work.’”When Clark-Neal first found fame, he lived the celebrity cliches – even buying a customised Range Rover with the silver lettering changed to Range Rylan. But, he says, he misjudged what fame would bring. Even interviewing Madonna, he says he found himself getting mobbed more than the queen of pop. “Not because I’m more recognisable. I’m not under any illusion that I’m an A-lister I don’t think I’m even on the alphabet scale. But I’m in people’s houses every day – I’m there when they wake up and there when they go to bed. So people think they know who I am. And, to a certain extent, they do.”Listen to his show and it is clear why strangers view him as a friend: he is warm, witty and gets his mum to phone in and natter on about ham and cheese toasties. Still, isn’t it a bit rich complaining about fame when he went all-out in search of it?“In the early days, it was all I ever wanted, more than the job,” he says. “I wanted people to know who I was. But now, much as I’m grateful for it, it’s the one thing I wish I didn’t have. Because I don’t leave my house. If I walk down the street, people will come up. And I can’t just go: ‘Get lost,’ because I’m not an arsehole.”He recalls a family wedding the other week – lovely people, great conversation. Then the evening approached. “That’s when it started,” he says. “People who’d been there all day started asking for photos. It’s that constant reminder that: ‘Oh shit, you’re Rylan.’ I’ve lost a lot of friends over it. Especially in telly, I’ve got one handful of people I can cry down the phone to and know it’s between us.”The Range Rylan had to go – too many eagle-eyed drivers started driving alongside him with cameras out, causing him to panic at the wheel. But he blames himself: “I sold my soul,” he says. “I went on X Factor and sold my soul … to the beast.”I wonder how he feels about reality TV in today’s climate, in which The Jeremy Kyle Show has been axed and Love Island heavily criticised after people who had starred in the programmes had mental health problems and even killed themselves. Clark-Neal thinks the main problem is the way fame ends suddenly once you leave the shows. “The second you walk out, you are on your own. I was very lucky. After the X Factor tour, I went back home … it was the first time I’d been in a room on my own for eight months, without anyone watching me. I remember waking up at 4am and thinking: ‘It’s over.’ If the phone hadn’t rung with the Big Brother job a few weeks later, I don’t know what I’d have done.”In fact, he has worked so much that at the end of 2017 he stepped back from his gig on This Morning to look after his mental health. He says he was getting up at 5am most days and not getting home until 2am. He was also struggling to deal with other problems, particularly his mum’s worsening health as a result of Crohn’s disease. Yet the decision drew criticism from some. “I remember seeing tweets from people saying: ‘Who do you think you are? I’ve worked for the NHS for 25 years and I’m not in a position to have time off.’“But then other people will say: ‘I never knew your mum nearly died, or was linked up to an IV drip six nights a week because she can’t digest food any more.’ And that’s because I don’t go on telly and every magazine going: ‘Poor me, my mum’s not well, now give me a tenner for the interview.’“Life is complicated,” he concludes, “but I’ve got a set of veneers that I smile through on morning TV.”After sharing his feelings about always being on duty, I feel guilty when the interview ends and I, too, ask for a favour. But my wife’s grandma, who has been ill, is a huge fan, so … if he wouldn’t mind … could he just do a little video message?“I’d love to,” he says. “What’s her name?”Mildred, I say.“Of course it is.”He whisks my phone from my hand and starts recording: “Hi Mildred, it’s Rylan, I hope you’re well. A little birdie tells me that you listen to my radio show. Thank you, because it’s nice to meet one of the three listeners. I hear you’ve had a few little issues, so I’m sending you all my love. And whenever you want to come to visit Radio 2, let me know.”It is nothing special, really, just a video message for someone he has never met – one of dozens he will no doubt do in the next few days. But it is so effortlessly sweet that I realise why he can’t walk down the street without being approached. And I think: whatever it was he sold to the beast, he definitely kept some of it back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4617128a17fccef80851f0cfce0879d1fe893f4/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e0544fe53bdd4221be6ba3cea1be8e7","title":"kushner plan leaves middle east deal seeming further away than ever","story":"Plan demands Palestinians put a price on their surrender or risk losing even more groundIn the long, lamented history of Israeli-Palestinian peace plans, rarely have expectations been so low. As Jared Kushner took to the stage in Bahrain to effectively lay waste to decades of doctrine on how to solve the conflict, a solution seemed more out of reach than ever.Kushner’s proposal has been put together by hardliners who have tossed out the rulebook and written a formula of their own serving the interests of the Israeli rightwing.The “Peace to Prosperity” conference on Tuesday marked the moment where the new mantra was imposed, demanding that Palestinians put a price on their surrender or risk losing even more ground under the most accommodating US administration that Israel has ever known.While Kushner acknowledged that the prosperity he touted was not possible without a “fair political solution”, a political dimension does not appear to be on the administration’s radar.And given Donald Trump’s record, it remains difficult to see how it could be in the remainder of his term. In less than 18 months, Jerusalem has been declared as Israel’s capital, US humanitarian aid has been slashed, settlement construction supported and diplomatic missions closed in Washington, the West Bank and Gaza.Add to that Trump’s recognition of Israel’s claim to the Golan Heights, captured from Syria 52 years ago, and there appears little hope of serious discussions.The foundations of longstanding peace plans underwritten by the US have been torn down and the model is now unrecognisable. There remains an outside chance that some of these seismic policy shifts could be overturned at a negotiating table. But sitting down at one may be a bridge too far for Palestinians bewildered by the abdication from time-honoured formulas. They would be doing so at the mercy of an administration that unashamedly favours one side.Trump officials have consistently failed to commit to the two-state solution model, the principles of which took Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin to the White House lawn in 1993, and Arafat and Ehud Barak to Camp David seven years later.Both were seminal moments that drew both sides to the point of a solution. Though they failed, they gave a glimpse of what might have been. Nothing has come close since and the ever more complicated political, legal and moral dimensions of the 71-year-old conflict had made a solution unlikely even before the Trump-imposed worldview.Trump has embraced the notion of being disruptor-in-chief, the leader who shook up an ossified world order, who abandoned the playbook, ignored briefings and made consequential calls on instinct and conviction.Kushner has infused his role as Middle East envoy with the approach of a business baron. “User pays” has been central to the way he has tried to do business in the region and his considerations have often been devoid of cultural or political realities. A central factor in the slow growth of the Palestinian economy has been the Israeli occupation. His “pathway to prosperity” plan does not appear to recognise this.With a weakened hand and little in the coffers, the Palestinians are facing immense pressure not to reject the deal outright. So far they have shown no appetite for anything that Kushner has to offer. A combustible Palestinian public, which on Tuesday rounded on the Bahrain workshop as a “sellout and surrender”, leaves little room to change their mind.“Not that we want to anyway,” said a senior PLO official in Beirut. “To do so would be the shame of a lifetime.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73009e6dbcfc5756b58e97707aafa24babb8def2/0_28_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa70c47f7d11b91a5f43e58fed47b542","title":"san francisco e cigarettes vaping juul ban","story":"The city is fighting the rise of youth vaping despite Juul, the biggest producer of e-cigarettes, being right in its backyardSan Francisco voted to ban e-cigarettes in the first legislation of its kind in the United States.Supervisors approved a measure banning the sale and distribution of e-cigarettes in an effort to curb the rise of youth vaping. The measure will now go for final approval to San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who said she will sign the legislation, and stores in the city will be required to remove e-cigarettes from their shelves after the change goes into effect in seven months.However, it will still be legal to purchase traditional cigarettes and marijuana products, including vapes for cannabis, in the city of San Francisco.After decades of decline in youth cigarette smoking, the rise of vaping has led to a major boost in nicotine use for people under the age of 21. More than 4.9 million American teens used e-cigarettes in 2018, an increase of 1.5 million teens in just one year.“We spent a few decades fighting big tobacco in the form of cigarettes,” Walton said. “Now we have to do it again in the form of e-cigarettes.”Juul has continued to expand its headquarters, announcing the purchase of a new 29-story skyscraper to accommodate its “rapidly growing team” on the same day the e-cigarette ban first passed the committee.A spokesman from Juul told the  the company will continue to push back against the legislation and is reportedly developing a ballot measure in November to keep e-cigarettes available for purchase.Juul and other advocates for vaping say the ban could result in more adults smoking cigarettes. “This full prohibition will drive former adult smokers who successfully switched to vapor products back to deadly cigarettes, deny the opportunity to switch for current adult smokers, and create a thriving black market instead of addressing the actual causes of underage access and use,” spokesman Ted Kwong said.Juul has taken some measures to prevent young people from taking up vaping , including banning the sale of flavored pods and restricting bulk purchases to prevent sharing products.﻿Purveyors of Juuls, including vape shops and corner stores, have expressed outrage at the impact of the decision on small businesses in the city. Some argued that stores in Oakland and Daly City, just across the Bay, stand to see major profits from the decision as people travel to get nicotine products.While the ban on e-cigarettes is clearly a blow to Juul, it is also a gesture directed at the US Food and Drug Administration, which has been slow to legislate the devices despite their explosion in popularity in recent years.In December 2018, the US Surgeon General issued an advisory calling youth vaping an “epidemic”.“San Francisco is taking action to protect our kids,” San Francisco city attorney Dennis Herrera said in a statement regarding the legislation. “This temporary moratorium wouldn’t be necessary if the federal government had done its job.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdf01661b9a7f9ae482fa52c8774610e11d9d875/77_404_4153_2493/master/4153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a33c5a1b218565cc5b69f5303a62efae","title":"highs of 45c expected in france as heatwave scorches europe","story":"Temperature records expected to be broken as minister warns heatwaves could become normNational highest-ever temperature records, typically set in late July or August, are likely to be broken across Europe this week as a potentially deadly early summer heatwave sweeps across the continent.Meteorologists expect previous June highs to be approached and possibly exceeded in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland, with all-time records likely to fall in some countries.“The latest forecasts leave little room for doubt: we are heading for a new national record,” said Guillaume Woznica, a French forecaster, noting Météo-France was now predicting peaks of 45C (113F) in the southern towns of Nîmes and Carpentras on Friday.The highest reliable June temperature previously recorded in France was 41.5C on 21 June 2003. The country’s highest ever temperature, recorded at two separate locations in southern France on 12 August during the same 2003 heatwave, was 44.1C.“At our local Potsdam station, operating since 1893, we’re set to break the past June record by about 2C,” tweeted Stefan Rahmstorf, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Eastern parts of Germany, including Berlin, are already experiencing their hottest June on record.High temperatures are expected to climb further throughout the week, from Spain to the Czech Republic, as the combination of a storm stalling over the Atlantic and high pressure over central Europe pulls very hot air northwards from the Sahara.Scientists say heatwaves can be particularly dangerous when they occur in early summer, before people have adjusted to seasonal norms. Europe’s 2003 heatwave resulted in the premature deaths of an estimated 70,000 people.A 2015 report on heatwaves and health, by the World Meteorological Organization and World Health Organization, found early summer heatwaves had been shown to be associated with greater impacts on mortality than later heatwaves of comparable or higher temperatures.A heatmap for France for 27 June, tweeted by the university meteorologist Ruben Hallali, next to the Edvard Munch painting The Scream, was widely shared on social media.From the low to mid-30Cs on Tuesday in parts of Spain, France and Italy, most weather models predict temperatures will rise by Thursday to the low to mid-40Cs in south and central France and north-east Spain, and the upper 30Cs in much of the rest of continental Europe.As authorities placed health services and retirement homes on alert, urged children and older people to stay indoors, handed out free water and recommended vigilance against dehydration and heatstroke, the French president, Emmanuel Macron said: “As you know, at times like these, sick people, pregnant women, infants and elderly people are the most vulnerable.“We must be vigilant and have preventive measures in place in order to intervene as quickly as possible.”France’s health minister, Agnès Buzyn, said the country was better prepared than in the 2003 heatwave, when 15,000 more people died than in a normal summer. “Our plans have got better and better,” she said. “Our alerts are more efficient.”Societal change was going to be necessary, Buzyn said. “We will have to change the way we live, the way we act, the way we work, travel, dress … We are going to have to change our habits and stop thinking these episodes are exceptional.”Among the first to be affected have been France’s high-school students, with the national brevet exams, sat by 15-year-olds, postponed by the education minister on safety grounds from Thursday and Friday until early next week.Brussels halted horse-and-carriage rides for tourists because of animal welfare concerns, Le Soir newspaper reported, while in Germany media reported a 32-year-old man in Hemer, outside Düsseldorf, had stripped naked in the frozen food section of his local supermarket in an effort to escape the heat.Rahmstorf said the current heatwave, following unusually high temperatures last summer that caused increased mortality rates, a decline in crop yields and wildfires inside the Arctic Circle, was consistent with climate scientists’ predictions.“Weather data show that heatwaves and other weather extremes are on the rise in recent decades,” he said. “The hottest summers in Europe since the year AD1500 all occurred since the turn of the last century: 2018, 2010, 2003, 2016, 2002.”Monthly records were now falling five times as often as they would in a stable climate, Rahmstorf said, adding this was “a consequence of global warming caused by the increasing greenhouse gases from burning coal, oil and gas”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21c5e4e1a02937c90a7c8255b582d3df6db19043/36_289_4153_2492/master/4153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc9b4e1fced757463d3ce3bb44dd067c","title":"iaaf agent qatar papa massata diack world athletics championships","story":"Emails suggest aide to the crown prince received request from Papa Massata Diack, who is wanted on corruption chargesLeaked emails appear to link a member of the Qatari royal family to a deal that is being investigated as part of a inquiry into alleged corruption surrounding bids for the 2017 athletics world championships and 2020 Olympic Games.French investigators have spent three years scrutinising two payments of $3.5m made in October and November 2011, a month before a vote by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to decide the host of the 2017 world championships. French investigators suspect the payments may have been a bribe to win votes for Qatar for the event, which was eventually won by London.Emails seen by the  and the French website Mediapart, which are not in the French police file, suggest that the disgraced IAAF marketing consultant Papa Massata Diack discussed a transfer of money in emails to an account run by Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa Al-Thani, just before the $3.5m payments were made. Al-Thani is a member of the royal family and chief of staff to Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who was then the crown prince and heir to the throne and became the emir of Qatar in 2013.Massata Diack, who is wanted by Interpol on corruption charges, begins one email to “Sheikh Khalid” by telling him: “Thanks again for your hospitality and diligence during my stay in Doha,” before providing his IAAF letter of affirmation that “QSI or Oryx QSI” is asking.“I do not owe it to them but to Your HH and yourself as you only know the role I play in this matter,” he adds. HH appears to refer to Tamim Al Thani, who was known as HH Heir Apparent when the letter was written in 2011., which published part of this letter in 2014, has seen evidence that points to “Sheikh Khalid” being the chief of staff to the then crown prince, based on an analysis with Mediapart of dozens of other emails sent to the same Hotmail account, some of which use Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa Al-Thani’s full name in Arabic.In the email Massata Diack says: “You will find attached the bank details for the transfer of $4.5 million which must be done as agreed.” In red ink he then adds: “The balance of 440,000 must remain in Doha in cash, I will pick it up the next time I come.”Papa Massata Diack specifies that the payment must be made “urgently today so that I can finalize things with the president” and show him “the signed contract and the bank confirmation”.The “president” in question appears to be his father Lamine, who was at the time the IAAF president. Papa Massata Diack and Lamine Diack were this week ordered to stand trial on charges of corruption and money laundering by French authorities. They are accused of being part of a conspiracy to bury positive drug tests by Russian athletes in return for money. They all deny the charges.As for the contract, it is believed to be between Massata Diack’s company Pamodzi and Oryx QSI, the company headed by a brother of Nasser al-Khelaifi, the president of Paris Saint-Germain football club and BeIN Sports.Seven days later, Oryx QSI made a $3m transfer to Pamodzi. A second one of $500,000 followed on 7 November 2011."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89a1614b708ddfb2e30677753bfb5e0b2d97b215/0_276_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca6fdf7c265fc199c69c8bbebbd9e43b","title":"denmarks youngest prime minister leads new leftist government","story":"Denmark has became the third Nordic country this year to form a leftist government after the Social Democratic party leader, Mette Frederiksen, finalised terms for a one-party minority government.

They have to take responsibility for their own workplace culture.“Everyone is entitled to dignity and respect at work. Sexual harassment has no place in any workplace.”The government is set to launch a consultation on workplace sexual harassment soon, when they will consider introducing a duty on employers to take preventative action, as well as extending protections to interns and volunteers.Currently, it’s the responsibility of victims to report sexual harassment at work, and there is no legal obligation for employers to take proactive action to stop it from happening.Research carried out by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) found that more than half of women have been sexually harassed at work, as well as seven out of 10 LGBT workers.TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “It’s shocking that in 2019 so many people experience sexual harassment and assault while at work. The government must strengthen the law to put responsibility for preventing harassment on employers.“This would shift the burden of tackling sexual harassment away from iniduals. And it would help end toxic workplace cultures that silence those who’ve been harassed.”Last week the International Labour Organisation (ILO) adopted a treaty that will introduce a global set of standards to prevent and deal with gender-based violence and harassment at work.The first of its kind convention will require ILO members, including the UK, to develop national laws prohibiting workplace violence, as well as providing protection measures and victim services."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Party\u0026rsquos Waterford branch backs motion of no confidence in the Fine Gael TDDonohoe signals that the tax cuts would not be introduced next year if UK crashes out of EURural schools often the \u0026lsquoheartbeat \u0026rsquo of rural communities, says Minister for Education\u0026Aacuteine Hyland says education issues were ignored and her views were never soughtMigrants with poor grasp of English more likely to face segregation, says ESRI reportDraft Public Accounts Committee report says original cost estimates were inaccurateResearch shows that men who smoke can lower sperm count of their sonsMeeting to take place on Wednesday to discuss removal of black paint from structureMan (42) claims sex with 30-year-old at friend\u0026rsquos house in Cork city was consensual\u0026lsquoImpersonation\u0026rsquo account issuing damaging and defamatory tweets, financier claimsCustoms intercepted package which was then delivered to Lucan house as garda\u0026iacute watched onTelecoms firm tells Oireachtas committee it is \u0026lsquocertain\u0026rsquo plan can be delivered for \u0026euro1bnDoherty says social welfare bonus and health overspend not included in calculationsJeff Olsen appeals for return of \u0026lsquopriceless\u0026rsquo footage of their ceremony\u0026lsquoNo basis\u0026rsquo for linking mental health facility and people with history of sexual offendingAidan Farrelly and Kevin Gavigan suffered cuts in pay by way of penaltyExisting policies not implemented equally across State \u0026ndash Garda Inspectorate reportCoroner describes the situation as \u0026lsquoentirely unsatisfactory\u0026rsquo and a \u0026lsquodiscourtesy to everyone\u0026rsquoPublic amenity at Stormont estate features a multi-sensory area for children with autism"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3937468.1561494012!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fg s john deasy hasn t been visible locally party members","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t John Deasy: “People don’t actually know what he’s doing in America. He’s probably scored a bit of an own goal himself in that he should be highlighting his work better”Up to 60 members of Fine Gael’s Waterford branch attended a local elections postmortem in a hotel on Monday, where they overwhelmingly backed a motion of no confidence in the Fine Gael TD. Just a handful abstained.He believes Deasy should do more to publicise his US immigration envoy role. “People don’t actually know what he’s doing in America. He’s probably scored a bit of an own goal himself in that he should be highlighting his work better.”However, some of Deasy’s own are less sympathetic. “He hasn’t been visible, and he hasn’t been active on the issues that are important to people. It has been a talking point for quite some time,” says Fine Gael councillor Damien Geoghegan. Geoghegan, who comfortably topped the poll last month in Dungarvan, told Damien Tiernan on WLR radio on Tuesday morning that Deasy “hasn’t been doing his job a as constituency TD for Waterford for quite some time”.Some in Dungarvan see criticism of Deasy as “jockeying” and an attempt to force him out to make way for a bid by former junior minister Paudie Coffey to return to the Dáil in the next election even if, in many case, they believe he deserves criticism. Never againOn Dungarvan’s streets one man, who did not wish to be identified said he has usually voted for Fianna Fáil, but regularly gave Deasy and Fine Gael second preferences “but never again”. “He’s non-existent, that’s the only way I can put it,” he said. Other members of the public around Dungarvan’s Grattan Square agree. “He hasn’t been active at all,” said one woman. “I’m disappointed in John Deasy. I think he’s taken a back seat.”Deasy entered the Dáil in 2002, taking over from his father, former minister for agriculture Austin Deasy, who served in the Dáil for 25 years. “You could approach Austin. John is a different breed. He’s not around. I’m just disappointed with him,” said another.There are still supporters of Deasy in Dungarvan. One woman described the no confidence motion as “harsh”, while another said he had been helpful when making representations for her. Many from other parties privately acknowledge that his office in the town is kept busy, and Deasy himself is regularly working in the background on matters, sometimes more effectively than he advertises. Most vocal criticSeveral of Fine Gael’s local councillors publicly distanced themselves from Deasy ahead of last month’s local elections, with some saying that they had not spoken to the TD for three years or more barring his father’s funeral in 2017.His most vocal critic is former leader of the Seanad Maurice Cummins, who said Deasy’s “disengagement” had left the party’s councillors “fighting with their hands tied” because of a lack of support from him. “It is time for party headquarters to get off the pot.”Cummins, whose son John has put himself forward as a Dáil candidate based in Waterford city, said that if Fine Gael decided to support Deasy for the Dáil he “certainly won’t work for him”.Other parties look on amused but in search of advantage. Asked to comment, Waterford Sinn Féin TD David Cullinane told his local radio programme that he felt he was “in the middle of a relationship break-up”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3936977.1561467170!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tusla board member leaves early claiming expertise was rejected","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRetired education professor Áine Hyland said “substantive issues relating to education were almost never brought to the attention” of the Tusla board.   Photograph: Cyril Byrne  THE IRISH TIMES A Tusla board member resigned one year into her three-year term, complaining that her views and expertise had been rejected, leaving it “impossible for me to make any meaningful contribution”. Áine Hyland, professor emeritus of education at University College Cork (UCC), was appointed to the board in January 2017, but in a resignation letter sent to Minster for Children Katherine Zappone one year later, she said “substantive issues relating to education were almost never brought to the attention of the board”. Prof Hyland estimated that “only about 3 per cent of the time of board meetings was spent on education-related issues” and that “my views were never sought on education-related issues”. A former civil servant in the Department of Education, she was involved in the establishment of the first multi-denominational school in the state, and subsequently worked as chair of Educate Together. She has served on multiple state commissions on education policy.The programme referenced is understood to be the Schools Completion Programme, which assists students at risk of not finishing formal education with staying in school. The programme was subject to extensive budget cuts during the recession, leaving the children in crisis who use it without support if more cutbacks were pushed through, according to a 2015 report by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI). The programme was established in 2002 and expanded over time to offer supports to vulnerable children, including in-school, after-school, holiday and out-of-school supports. Since it was established, primary attendance rates and retention to Leaving Certificate levels have improved. Administration of the programme transferred from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to Tusla in 2014. Since then, unions have criticised funding cutbacks.Prof Hyland also told the Minister that her request for a sub-committee of the board to examine education matters was “vetoed by the board”. “As it has proved impossible for me to make any meaningful contribution to Tusla during the past year, I have concluded that I no longer have a role on the board,” Prof Hyland told the Minister. There was a meeting between Prof Hyland and Ms Zappone concerning the SCP reform proposals in November 2017, following which she wrote to board members saying key documents relating to the review had not been seen by the board.In a letter to the Minister in the days after Prof Hyland’s resignation, Tusla chair Norah Gibbons disputed the content of the academic’s letter to Ms Zappone. She said board members “are afforded the opportunity to fully contribute to board deliberations, and to provide constructive challenge, whilst guarding against excessive influence on board decision making by one or more inidual board members”. The letter also reveals the board “expressed concern” Ms Zappone had met with Prof Hyland “without the chair or board being notified in advance and queried in what capacity Ms Hyland had attended”. Ms Gibbons argued the SCP reform was informed by work done on the programme by an expert panel. She said that the board frequently discussed matters relating to education.

A report by the London School of Economics (LSE) into children’s attitudes towards the internet found they overwhelmingly wanted a ‘grand erasure’ of their online footprint to stop childhood mistakes affecting their future.The research, which was funded by the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, also found that children were generally trusting of tech companies in the same way they are of their schools.LSE researchers reviewed more than a decade’s worth of studies into children’s understanding of their online data and also conducted focus groups with more than 160 secondary school-age children.Professor Sonia Livingstone, who led the research, said children were generally “outraged” when they learned how much of their personal information is being hoarded online and wanted “a fresh start” when they turned 18.She said: “They say ‘whatever I do before I am 18 should be wiped off’ as it shouldn’t have any effect on them as an adult. They want a kind of grand erasure because they talk about the importance of making mistakes and just being kids trying things out.”The Government is currently looking at a range of new measures to better protect children online including imposing a legal duty of care on tech giants and introducing an Age Appropriate Design Code, which will mean social media giants will have to assume users are children if they can\u0027t age verify them.Duty of Care white paperMost social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but due to the lack of proper age checks the study found children as young as nine said they had profiles.The study found that children generally took instructions they received online on “face value” and often didn’t understand how tech companies were commercially benefiting from the information they handed over. As a result, they found it “puzzling” that internet companies often asked them to give out details they did not see as relevant to the service.The children interviewed were also shocked to learn that material they thought they had deleted could still exist online and wanted “delete to mean delete” when it came to social media.Other features children wanted from tech companies were a way to see which other companies their details had been shared with and “child-friendly mechanisms” to edit their information.Prof Livingstone said the children were generally mystified as to why tech companies were interested in personal information they saw as quickly going out of date as they grew up.She added: “Creepy is a really common word that they use. It’s creepy and sinister that all that data is being kept.”Duty of Care CampaignSimple prostate cancer test could diagnose five years early and prevent thousands of invasive operations Victims of revenge porn could get anonymity in shake-up of laws to tackle new online sex crimesIVF treatment increases risk of breast cancer, major study findsHundreds of villages lose their GP surgery as crisis grows across countryGrandmother, 92, \u0026#39arrested\u0026#39 after lifelong ambition to \u0026#39know what it was like to be naughty\u0026#39Cannabis should be legalised within five years, says former Conservative Minister 19th century Sicilian puppet shows dragged young men into crime, claims history authorBoris Johnson lays out \u0026#39ABC\u0026#39 Brexit plan as he vows Britain will leave EU by October 31 \u0026#39come what may\u0026#39 The Archers \u0026#39tricked\u0026#39 1950s farmers into modern methods by portraying small farms as \u0026#39backward\u0026#39, says expertNew staging of Enid Blyton\u0026#39s Malory Towers story suggests \u0026#39tomboy\u0026#39 Bill is really transgenderComment: Want to end the reign of public schoolboys at the top?

Wangige is hardly Helmand, nor, by his own admission, did counterinsurgency work particularly well in either Afghanistan or Iraq.Ex-major Wayne Hennessy-Barrett, 46, served in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo and Iraq before founding 4G in 2013 in KenyaYet the traditional “microfinance” model of lending to the poor was not working either, Mr Hennessy-Barrett reckoned. Once a buzzword in development circles, microfinance has been hailed by its proponents as a powerful tool in fighting poverty. Tony Blair and Bill Clinton were both fans.The idea was simple enough. Many poor people in the developing world eke out a living as petty traders, but rarely have access to the credit needed to grow their businesses.Microfinance was meant to give them that access through  small loans and low-cost banking services, setting them on the path to self-sufficiency. The model has gone global in recent decades: more than 200m people round the world have been the recipients of “microcredit”.The miracle has largely failed to happen, however. While disagreements about the impact of microfinance abound, studies have suggested that the model has largely failed to lift the poor out of poverty. Many, indeed, have been left worse off because they have been plunged into debt.Mr Hennessy-Barrett reckons the problem largely lies with the model used by most microfinanciers. To keep overheads down, many companies lend through mobile phone apps and have little interaction with their clients or knowledge of what the money is going to be spent on.Wayne Hennessy-Barrett at a market in WangigeOften cash is borrowed to cover unexpected crises, such as funerals and medical operations. Reflecting a growing problem in Kenya, loans to cover online gambling are also increasing, according to government officials.Lacking a sufficient or regular enough income to pay back the loans, many default. More than one million people have been blacklisted by the country’s two main credit ratings, sometimes over loans of less than £5.Credit alone, Mr Hennessy-Barrett realised, was likely to do more harm than good. Only if people borrowed sensibly, and understood how to turn loans into larger incomes, would they have a chance of escaping poverty rather than being sucked deeper into it.“Just shoving money at people is not enough,” he said. “Having a loan to solve a problem is not enough. What you need is a livelihood where you can use credit for leverage. When it it just to live it is a recipe for poverty.“Cheap debt pushed carelessly at poor people keeps poor people poor.”Valentine Nasila, Operations Manager at 4G Capital\u0026#39s head office, speaks with a clientThere was no question in his mind that microcredit was still the key to fighting poverty. In a country where formal jobs are few and far between, three in four working Kenyans are self-employed, scratching a living by selling goods to other poor people.Yet if poor borrowers were to have a chance of success, he concluded, they would need much more face-to-face support from trained professionals who understood the needs and challenges of their clients.It was in attempting to meet this need that Mr Hennessy-Barrett drew on his army experience. In Afghanistan, the British army’s counterinsurgency operations were designed to deny insurgents ground by protecting communities, creating the conditions to let them live normal lives and speaking to people to understand their needs and reassure them.Such skills could also be deployed in peacetime environments, he felt. From the time of its foundation in a small office in Wangige in 2013, his company, 4G Capital, would run along army lines.Wayne Hennessy-Barrett\u0026#39s business is one of Africa’s fastest growing financial technology companies“In Afghanistan we had several teams of elite soldiers operating in multiple places, communing with the population, trying to understand their needs,” he said.“That led to a methodology of having small teams of well-trained, dedicated professionals.”From the outset, Mr Hennessy-Barrett deployed his staff in teams of four and sent them to trawl through the markets using his own interpretation of the army’s “patrol trinity”.In counterinsurgency terms, this meant “intelligence gathering”, “framework protection” and “local assurance”. For 4G, this was reinterpreted as “marketing”, “lending” and “growth and repayment”. Teams would seek to understand the environment they were operating in, lend to iniduals after learning what their needs were and finally helping them to grow their businesses so they could repay their loans.The loans on offer were small, between £40 and £400, and had to be repaid within a month, the intention being to enforce discipline and focus money where it was needed: replenishing inventory, adding stock and growing businesses.Crucially, it also came with basic training, teaching clients how to maximise growth potential, keep books and improve customer care. The mixture of personal attention and computer algorithms to assess the viability of clients’ growth potential means that 92 percent of loans are paid on time, meaning the company has more money to lend.The model appears to have been phenomenally successful. From its original outlet in Wangige, 4G Capital now has 70 more, with more than 300 employees. Expanding into Rwanda and Uganda, it is one of Africa’s fastest growing financial technology companies. It expects to lend £47 million over the next 12 months.Optometrist Tabitha Njeri, 26, borrowed £80 from 4G Capital to start her own optician\u0026#39s storeThe success, Mr Hennessy-Barrett says, has come from “slaving” the company’s fortunes to the fortunes of its clients. It is doing well because its clients have seen their businesses grow on average by 82 per cent since taking their first loan from 4G.Tabitha Njeri, who runs a small optician’s shop in Wangige, is one such beneficiary. 4G lent her £80 towards her startup costs early last year, gave her training in accountancy and business growth skills and rolled over loans to allow her to increase stock from 50 to 150 glasses. She now plans to expand by opening a diagnosis lab.“I used to find it very difficult to raise enough to support my family,” she said. “Now I can. I have financial stability.”Down the road, Patrick Ngore, who runs a chemist’s, says he has been able to increase stock sevenfold with loans from the company. He also credits training in stock management and minimising expenditure in growing his profit margins from 20 to 40 per cent.Others in Wangige tell similar stories.In many ways, the 4G model, although partially reliant on technology,  is a return to the basics of microfinance. Loans have allowed Patrick Ngore, owner of a chemists,to increase his stock sevenfold and boost his profit margin from 20 per cent to 40 per centThe founder of modern microfinance is generally held to be Mohammed Yunus, who started making small loans to the very poor in Bangladesh in 1976. Lending mostly to women, who formed small groups that were collectively responsible for each other’s debts, he found that astonishingly few defaulted.His Grameen Bank has now made more than £7 billion pounds in small loans to the poor, an achievement that secured him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.Yet the microfinance model he pioneered would grow increasingly troubled. Irresponsible and often predatory lending to the poor led to debt crises in Bosnia, Morocco and parts of Pakistan. It also contributed to a debtors’ revolt in Nicaragua in 2008 when farmers, backed by President Daniel Ortega, refused en masse to pay back microcredit loans. A microfinance default crisis in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh two years later was blamed for a surge in suicide by farmers.Geoffrey Kamanu runs through a finance training programme with staff from 4G Capital The longstanding problem with microfinance, which is largely driven by private companies like 4G, is that business logic often leads to aggressive tactics in collecting debts, says David Roodman, author of the book Due Diligence: An Impertinent Inquiry into Microfinance.In countries like Kenya many microfinance outfits lend at interest rates as high as 30 per cent because they are forced to raise capital from commercial banks, often placing an intolerable burden on poor borrowers.Mr Hennessy-Barrett says his model is addressing those concerns: interest rates are capped at 13.5 per cent and allowances are made for “bad-luck customers” who encounter unexpected setbacks like illness or a death in the family.Experts in Kenya generally applaud 4G Capital’s model, which has been mimicked by one or two other outfits. But they also raise questions about what impact it can really have.Microcredit | Transforming fortunes and futures in NepalDespite its growth, 4G and its 120,000 customers are still pretty small fry, says Paul Musoke, director of financial institutions at FSD Africa, a UK-funded organisation that looks at ways to financially empower the poor.By contrast, M-Shwari and Tala, two providers of small loans through mobile phone apps, have 11 million between them in Kenya alone. Such “light-touch” models, which use technology rather than people to engage with borrowers are always likely to do better than “heavy-touch” approaches like Mr Hennessy-Barrett’s — except in densely populated countries like Bangladesh.“It makes sense what he is trying to do,” says Mr Musoke. “The question is whether it can be scaled up significantly to make an impact.”The other danger in Kenya is that a microfinance “debt bubble” risks being created because, in a poorly regulated market, there is little to stop poor borrowers from taking loans from 4G and other companies offering unsecured credit at the same time.Microfinancing: revolutionising the health and livelihoods of Nepalese women“The greatest potential for harm has come when you have multiple lenders all growing at once because then almost certainly people are borrowing from one to pay the other,” says Mr Roodman.Mr Hennessy-Barrett’s model seems enlightened, yet it is too soon to tell how effective it will be. History suggests that microcredit often stimulates start-up businesses, but ultimately fails to enrich its owners, becoming more a tool helping to manage poverty than to reduce it. Mr Roodman likens it to a prescription drug “useful in moderation but dangerous in large doses”.While it may not be a panacea, microfinance has given people more choice, whatever the overall risks. If Mr Hennessy-Barrett can tweak a flawed model and encourage others to follow suit, he could yet prove as successful pioneer as Mohammed Yunus.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Banks and FinanceSimple prostate cancer test could diagnose five years early and prevent thousands of invasive operations Victims of revenge porn could get anonymity in shake-up of laws to tackle new online sex crimesIVF treatment increases risk of breast cancer, major study findsHundreds of villages lose their GP surgery as crisis grows across countryGrandmother, 92, \u0026#39arrested\u0026#39 after lifelong ambition to \u0026#39know what it was like to be naughty\u0026#39Cannabis should be legalised within five years, says former Conservative Minister 19th century Sicilian puppet shows dragged young men into crime, claims history authorBoris Johnson lays out \u0026#39ABC\u0026#39 Brexit plan as he vows Britain will leave EU by October 31 \u0026#39come what may\u0026#39 The Archers \u0026#39tricked\u0026#39 1950s farmers into modern methods by portraying small farms as \u0026#39backward\u0026#39, says expertNew staging of Enid Blyton\u0026#39s Malory Towers story suggests \u0026#39tomboy\u0026#39 Bill is really transgenderComment: Want to end the reign of public schoolboys at the top?

Suddenly they had a show which was going to be an enormous hit.The audience became huge and at the time of Grace Archer\u0027s death in a fire it peaked at 20 million listeners.People thought The Archers was a real community and the scenes were real, and the BBC encouraged that. The cast were interviewed by creator Godfrey Baseley as if it was a real village with real characters.The BBC were amazed by the response to a programme about a farming community but we had a government that thought small farms were inefficient and backward, and what we need is bigger farms.The BBC sided with the government Brookfield Farm started to get bigger and the character Gabriel was made into a clown, which undermined the community feel that people had enjoyed.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

No it\u0027s Woolaston\u0027s Mystery Man.His identity remained secret throughout the day and has remained so ever since as it is feared he fled with the proceeds. It is unknown exactly how much entry money was taken but fete-goers have estimated it could be more than £100.Villagers say they still don\u0027t know if they have been duped or are victims of a bad joke by the man who concealed his face the entire time.And now those behind the Woolaston Carnival in the Forest of Dean have issued a desperate plea for the man to hand over the money before they call in police.Carnival co-ordinator Andy Morgan Watts who led the parade in his vintage car dressed as a ringmaster, said: He just appeared.Everybody was applauding him because it seemed such a clever way of raising money,But when he disappeared it left a bad taste because people thought they had been giving money to charity.I still like to believe that he is just dragging it out to get the maximum amount of money possible from a good idea.\u0027\u0027Some people think I\u0027m being too kind but we will have to wait and see which way it goes. It\u0027s clearly as black and white as his suit.Woolaston Carnival organisers have launched an appeal for informationOrganisers said they did not think there was anything sinister about the man in the chequered morph suit who joined the carnival parade as it wended its way around the small upmarket village which is just off the A48.He even cheekily put his belongings in the back of a vintage car and made a thumbs up sign so he would have his hands free to hand out leaflets.There\u0027s nothing unusual in people joining the parade so we didn\u0027t think much of it when he snuck in, said Sue Anderson who is on the carnival committee.Everyone thought it was a great idea and he was dancing with the samba band and putting his arm around children who wanted their photograph taken with him.It was a beautiful day and everybody was having a good time but later on towards the end, when everybody thought he was going to climb on stage and do the big reveal, nobody could find him. He had just disappeared.Some villagers said they had seen the mystery man melt away from the memorial fields down a public footpath while carrying a deckchair and what looked like an old music bag or briefcase.They thought he would be coming back but when the man did not come forward Sue and her husband Tony, chairman of the carnival committee, put an appeal out on Facebook asking the joker to reveal himself.They then received an email from the Woolaston carnival mystery man offering to put over £100 into the bank if they gave details of the carnival account.The couple have not heard anything since declining to do so while suggesting a meeting so he could hand over the cash.We want to give him a chance in case it\u0027s someone who means well and has just taken a joke a bit too far, said Ms Anderson.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

They have a panic button that summons the window manager, andhe needs to, he’ll call the police without hesitation.There are so many police cameras and CCTV cameras in the Red Light District I’d say it’s actually one of the safest places to work, and I’ve been a sex worker for five years.I do it because I like it, not for the money or because it’s my only option.I’m , although I tell clients I’m  , and I have a few boyfriends, nothing serious.My le is pretty normal and I’d say I’m actually pretty privileged - I’ve got a degree and I worked as a nurse.When I was doing that I saw a lot of the patients craved physical affection. Sometimes they told you nicely, sometimes they misbehaved and grabbed you.But the patients weren’t put first at hospital, so I changed my job.Now, as well as the sex work, I’m a district nurse in people’s houses.I like it because it gives you more time to spend one-on-one with your patients and that’s what I like about sex work as well – it’s absolute quality time.I make a lot of people very happy and it’s rewarding in lots of ways. It’s not just the money.I prefer sex work to nursing but the people at Exxpose tell me I don’t know my own mind, and that’s what annoys me.They say the consent of vulnerable people is being bought by men with money and power – that’s a ridiculous generalisation. In reality it’s a business transaction like any other. I’m an independent entrepreneur who pays her taxes – quite a lot of taxes, actually. I get  eurosfor one hour.What the people behind the Exxpose campaign aren’t telling you is that it’s all rooted in their religion.They’re trying to save us when we don’t need saving – except maybe from the saviours themselves!They only see and hear what they want to – they think sex workers must have had a bad childhood or be addicts. They’re changing the facts to suit their argument.If two people of legal age agree to have sex, what’s wrong with that It’s true that there are bad things going on in the Red Light District, human trafficking does exist but its also re in other industries such as the restaurant trade – but I don’t see the Exxpose lot campaigning to make it illegal to buy a Chinese takeaway.It’s true that the Brits have a reputation in the Red Light District because of the amount of beer they drink, which goes hand in hand with some pretty bad behaviour.But let’s not forget our boys from the Dutch countryside, who can be just as boisterous.The Brits come here on stag dos, granted, but the same bad behaviour happens in Barcelona and Madrid – and there’s no Red Light District in those cities.Decriminalising sex work altogether it is the best policyyou ask me.I thought the whole point of feminism was empowering women to do as they please, not restricting their rights and opportunities.These Exxpose campaigners are young and naïve. I hope when they’re my age they’ll look back and think, What on earth was I thinking, telling other people what to do In the Netherlands it’s illegal to put puppies in a pet shop window because we believe it’s cruel – and yet we put our young women behind a window and pretend it’s normal.Tourists can walk around the Red Light District gawping at them without paying any money at all – those ladies are a tourist attraction and a lot of people get to see them in their underwear for free.Our campaign is staffed by volunteers, mostly young people. We see too much harm going on, too much human trafficking and we object to the normalisation of the buying of sex.It isn’t about a woman’s right to sell sex. Women should be free to do what they want with their bodies - I can totally understand why people do it and I think it’s a really brave decision to sell sex.I can totally imagine doing that.Demand for prostitution in countries who follow the Nordic Model, as this law is known, has decreased too.The idea is that making it a criminal offense to buy sex reduces sex trafficking.Estimates of the amount of prostitutes in the Netherlands y, but there are thought to be between , and ,.In , officials suggested that about £million a year was spent on sex transactions in the country. Sex workers there now pay tax on their earnings.In , the number of prostitutes in the UK was estimated as being ,, while one in ten men admit paying for sex.I grew up in a village near Rotterdam with my brother and four sisters.Things were comfortable, my mum was a nurse and my dad had his own aluminium business.They’re both Christians and that’s how I was raised, I still go to church and I’m married.It all plays into the campaign because I knew I was blessed growing up, that others didn’t have what I did. I worked in a rehab centre for a while and I saw that.I knew I wanted to help people, and after I saw a documentary about sex work things clicked.I spoke to my friends and we realised that we might be able to really change thingswe could get the government to talk about the issue.The problem is the men who want to buy sex here typically don’t respect women’s boundaries. They’ve drunk a lot and they behave extremely badly, asking for really cheap prices.They ask for things their wives won’t do: anal sex or role-play where the woman pretends to be a -year-old girl.There’s a lot of violence by customers, they want to have sex without a condom or be so rough the woman bleeds, and the women are under pressure to put up with it or clients won’t pay.Most people selling sex are vulnerable women who need the money or who have been forced into sex work. Because it’s legal to pay for sex, men using their services can ignore the horrible realities behind their actions.Europol research from  shows that Amsterdam is susceptible to human trafficking precisely because we have a big market for cheap sex.So it’s the so-called “ethics” of paying for sex which need to be revisited.There’s a saying in Dutch that everything that anything that can be bought can also be stolen. In you think about that, you can begin to see how prostitution fuels rape.We believe that you cannot buy consent under any circumstances. It’s the men and women who buy sex who would be punished under our proposal and most of them would stopit were made illegal.What do we propose for the women who will be made unemployed by the shrinking of the market  We’d get them into dferent jobs in safe environments which don’t make them vulnerable to sexual abuse.People say that our campaign is funded by the church mafia but that’s not true.Yes I go to church but this is a matter of feminist principle and our approach makes a lot of sense to the large number of young people who support us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris will only be our th Prime Minister since the very first, Robert Walpole, who was in office from  to .The fact that more than a third of them went to Eton , suggests that social mobility in this country is in terminal decline.Indeed, when it comes to the children of ordinary homes reaching the highest office in the land, social mobility is stone-cold dead.Fee-paying privilege provides the fast-track to power. Yet it wasn’t always this way.There was a golden age of ­meritocracy in the last century when it was normal for our PMs to be educated by the state.Eton was still a bastion of academic excellence in those happy years. So was Harrow, which has produced seven Prime Ministers, and Westminster, which educated six.But between  and , there was enough healthy social mobility in this country for Harold Wilson, Ted Heath, Jim Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher and John Major — all educated at state schools — to become Prime Minister.Major and Callaghan didn’t even go to university. Callaghan couldn’t afford it, while Major left school at  with three O-levels.All five came from modest ­backgrounds, although Wilson, Heath and Thatcher were clever enough to get into Oxford University.For more than three decades, state-educated politicians competed with those who were the product of expensive private educations — and beat them to the top job.This is not an argument against Boris Johnson becoming Prime ­Minister simply because he went to Eton. Boris seems like the man most likely to prevent a Marxist government. This would destroy our economy — a fate far worse than either staying in or leaving the European Union.SoI was a Tory MP or party member, then I would probably prefer Boris to take on Brussels, Corbyn and the Brexit Party.But yet another old Etonian in  Downing Street proves that social mobility is nowhere near what it was in the last century. Andwe care about a fair and equal society, then that should concern us all.It feels signicant that the first candidate to be eliminated from the Tory leadership race was Esther McVey — the candidate from  the least privileged background, reinforcing the belief that Westminster is a closed shop.But when it comes to getting on in le, and even getting to Downing Street, it should not matter a damn where you were born.Your ability — and your willingness to graft — should matter far more than Mummy and Daddy’s bank ­balance.Le can never be totally fair. But two Old Etonian PMs in less than ten years is grotesque.  If there is to be a bright, shining future for this country after we leave the EU, there MUST be more social mobility.Once he has sorted out Brexit  and buried Corbyn, perhaps our Old ­Etonian PM will do something about it. Because inequality is still entrenched at birth.And that stinks.WHAT is mankind’s greatest invention  The Internet  The printing press  The steam engine  Penicillin If, like me, you are allergic to penicillin, then the gold shorts that Kylie Minogue wore in her Spinning Around promo probably have the edge on all of them. Kylie’s gold gear might make a comeback when she plays Glastonbury next Sunday.And  years after their debut, nobody has ever developed an allergy to them.As the wolf evolved into the dog, it sussed that making its eyes bigger made the humans go all soft and gooey inside.Dr Juliane Kaminski, of the University of Ports- mouth, says: “The evidence is compelling that dogs developed a muscle to raise the inner eyebrow after they were domesticated from wolves. It seems to elicit a strong desire in humans to look after them.”Those puppy-dog eyes are designed to make your heart melt.Certainly when Stan, our Cavalier King Charles spaniel, looks at me with his enormous, big round peepers, I understand the three little words he is trying to say.Give. Stan. Cheese.IT is weird the way even the greatest TV series can go off the boil.On the surface, the second series of Killing Eve has everything that made the first such a blast.Jodie Comer is still brilliant as psychopathic assassin Villanelle, doing a iety of convincing accents and changing her clothes more often than Diana Ross in concert.Sandra Oh is again wonderful as the sexually confused, domestically challenged spook.But I have watched the entire second series now and it just doesn’t catch fire the way the first did.And that is because the first series of Killing Eve had three female stars in Jodie Comer, Sandra Oh and – behind the scenes – Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who wrote the script.Now Waller-Bridge has gone off to save the screenplay of the next James Bond movie.And Killing Eve badly misses her magic dust.JEW-HATING has become the racism  that is permissible.The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, told the Cambridge Union debating society that his Jewish friends: “Are not like the other Jews – that’s why they are my friends.”He got a laugh.If he had said “black” or “Muslim”, he would have been nicked.THERE are some scary TV shows out there.Doing Question Time is daunting because you can be certain that at least half of the audience will hate your guts.Have I Got News For You  is forbidding because the ageing team captains and presenters have been doing it since the dawn of time and are used to the show’s format .But nothing comes close to the terror factor of Mastermind.To sit in that black leather chair as the lights go down is to know true stage fright. So Hamish Cameron must have been a very brave man indeed.Hamish held the record for the most appearances on Mastermind –  – and after filming the final last November, he learned he had terminal cancer.Shortly before the final was broadcast last week, Hamish died at the age of .The BBC had considered postponing the broadcast as a mark of respect but Hamish had instructed his family that he wanted the show to go on.As someone who vowed “never again” after sitting in that hot seat just the once, I can only salute Hamish’s courage.The Mastermind catchphrase “I’ve started so I’ll finish” could have been invented for this fearless man.IF Heathrow gets a third runway, then the impact on the environment will be huge, with hundreds of extra flights landing and taking  off every day.And that’s just for Emma Thompson!Their honeymoon must have been filthy.ANDREA LEADSOM says she was told by senior Tory women that they could not back her because the party couldn’t have “another woman” Prime Minister so soon after Theresa May.But the Tories’ past willingness to be led by a woman is surely something to celebrate.  The Conservatives will almost certainly be on their third female Prime Minister before the -year-old male-dominated Labour Party has its first.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why feel guilty about watching it The appeal of this show is fairly obvious — it’s the intimate access you get.Viewers feel like they’re on holiday on on the island too, as invisible guests.The ultimate fly-on-the-wall experience.We hear the most private of conversations, witness the most explosive fallouts. We even get in the shower with them.It’s so intimate that it feels the same as when you read someone ’s diary.Of course, we are watching insanely beautul people parading around in tiny scraps of swimwear. But no matter how gorgeous the contestants, each one is revealed to be as fragile as the next.I think that is where our real fascination lies.Surely they should all be full of confidence, looking the way they do  And yet they seem to be just as insecure as the rest of us.I like the fact that the show is a portal into a generation to which I no longer belong.I’ve learned so much about how young men and women behave and, until Maura uttered the words, I didn’t even know it was possible to have “fanny flutters”.Another thing I like is the escapism. Surely it’s no coincidence that Love Island is at peak popularity during a time when the news is totally dominated with gloom, doom — and Brexit.Personally, I’m also intrigued by the fake hair and nails — and the very y process of getting ready for a night out. I’m luckyI put a comb through my hair.The amount of make-up they manage to get on to their faces is astonishing — although the irony is that the one girl all the guys seem to like, Lucie, is a surfer chick who doesn’t wear make-up.There is also a real cruelty to the show, though. There is always someone better, someone more chosen. The voting process is brutal and leaves all of the contestants anxious about whether or not people like them.This show strips people of everything that is important, other than their body. They are measured on what they look like and little .As a result, lots of people have questioned the damage caused to the mental health of the contestants.There have been more than , complaints to Ofcom about this series already.But there are good things about Love Island.While it’s not exactly the kind of equality that women have been fighting for over the past  years, there’s no denying that female members in the house are as free as the men to proposition members of the opposite sex.In my day, all we had was: “My mate fancies you.” But Maura said of one guy that he gave her “fanny flutters”.When my daughter Sophia was asked to go on the show, she thought it would be fun to be on a free holiday. You can see her point.But no mother wants to watch their child on Love Island. We all know there are plenty of things our kids do that we don’t know about — and that’s the way it should stay.But it’s not just that. One reason I enjoy being part of the Apprentice is because it celebrates young people for their skills, ambition and what they achieve.They know they aren’t being valued for their looks — they are being valued for so much more than that.That said, no one’s self- esteem should be based on how others value us.I’ve often thought that my biggest superpower is that I really don’t care what people think about me.When I’m on the beach I’m not bothered about which bits and pieces are jiggling.Why  Because there is so much more to me than what I look like in a bikini.Or, rather, as a footballer’s we once said to me: “All I’ve got is my looks — at least you’ve got your personality.”I know it was a back-handed compliment. But you know what, I’m fine with that.LOTTIE Moss said on social media that she feels “uncomfortable” with her weight at the moment – as she posted a picture of herself in a dress on a night out.My first thought was she’s going to look back at those photos when she is in her fties and wonder how she could have felt uncomfortable when she looked like this.My second was she can’t worry that much because the dress she’s wearing is almost completely see-through.BOSSES of the Isle of Wight Festival have been criticised by two mental-health charities for banning Jess Glynne for le after the singer cancelled her show at the last minute, owing to anxiety.Anxiety is a debilitating condition which blights the lives of many people.I’m sorry to hear that Jess is one of those people.But when she knows she suffers from this condition, her choice to stay out partying with the Spice Girls until am on the day she was due to perform seems, well, questionable.Having been out drinking all night before work is enough to make even the most level-headed person anxious.To then go on social media advertising that fact, before effectively phoning in sick to work, is also a tad foolish.By doing that, Glynne gave the impression she chose partying over a commitment – and that is not a good look.If we have one job to do as parents, it is to teach our kids the importance of doing the things that need to be done, when they need to be done, whether you like it or not.When I see a young person doing what they said they would do, despite challenges, I know they’ve got backbone.It’s called resilience, grit, determination, and it’s about being irrepressible. Those are some of the most admirable traits a person can have.Anxiety is awful but it’s certainly not helped by partying until the early hours of a work day.THIS week there has been good and bad news for Boris Johnson. The good news is that it looks ashe is going to be our next Prime Minister.The bad news is not that early-hours row with his partner – it’s his new haircut.He used to have “The Trump”, a sort of comb-forward that hid his balding. But his barber has cut it off and, instead of the long-haired blond bombshell look, he’s now a blond basin with thinning top.Boris, please take it from me, when you go into a hairdresser’s the first thing you do is check out the hairstyle of the person holding the scissors.Anyway, I guess it grows back – and soon will be the haystack it’s always been. Now all Boris needs is a new suit.OOPS! My heart goes out to the mum of the rampaging toddler at a Swiss art show who knocked over a sculpture of a fly worth £,.My main question, though, is how a plastic sculpture of a fly could be worth so much money Someone, somewhere, is having a laugh.

He is a handsome, successful star who is still with his we – Sheryl Berkoff – after  years without trading her in for a younger model.And they look happy.A rare sight in Hollywood, so good luck to both of them.TO be fair, Sofia Richie pretty much pulled it off when she sported the latest bicycle shorts onesie – the trend you prayed would never happen.But all I can say is, I’m glad I don’t follow fashion.WHAT’S in a word  You might think nothing much. And it’s a small thing in a way, but Sainsbury’s needs to be called out for assuming on its hair-removal product that all doctors are male.Its instructions say: “Consult your usual doctor and show him the packaging.”No doubt lots of people will respond by saying that us women are far too easily offended.But it is assumptions such as this behind the fact that, for every £ a man makes, a woman only makes p.We have to stamp out this unconscious bias by calling it out every time we see it.AMAZING that it’s  years since Friends hit our TVs.But judging by pictures of its stars Jenner Aniston, , and Courteney Cox, , on vacation in their bikinis, they still look fantastic.Even more amazing is that they are genuine friends.It just goes to show thatyou eat well, work out and look after yourself, you don’t have to be fat and flabby at .*Note to self – eat better and go to the gym. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was a great manipulator but I never saw that at the time.“I’m thankful he’s been jailed and the world can see him as the monster he truly is.”Lisas nightmare began in  when she met Gorringe in a supermarket while shopping with her mum.As a friendship between the three blossomed, Lisa and her mum would go for dinner at his home and he offered to tutor her once a week in what the court heard was the systematic corruption of a child.We really thought we could trust him but I realise that this was the start of his trap, Lisa said.By December , Gorringes behaviour turned sinister and he touched the teen in a park one night leaving Lisa frozen in fear.He then began abusing Lisa a couple of times a week and bought her a phone so they could message in private.Then, in January , Gorringe raped Lisa at his home.She says: “The pain was unbearable. I just wanted it to be over, so I stayed quiet.“But, after that, Anthony raped me whenever we were alone together.“I felt so alone and would cry in my room for hours. He never threatened me but I wouldn’t dare tell anyone.”Gorringe would regularly rape Lisa and demand she sleep with his friends - with the teen too terried to refuse.One day, he introduced her to his mechanic Barry Gaynor and forced Lisa to have sex with him as payment for a car he fixed.Trapped Lisa had no choice but to go along with what her evil abuser wanted - and she even moved in with him in  when she was  as she had nowhere  to go.Despite cops arresting Gorringe after allegations were made against him by someone , the beast stepped up his campaign of abuse and even took naked pictures of Lisa.Officers discovered the images on his seized laptop and Gorringe admitted seven counts of taking indecent photographs of a child and one count of possession of indecent photographs of a child.He was caged for eight years but Lisa was still too terried to tell police about her four-year hell at the hands of Gorringe.It was only when she married her husband in  and became a mum that she finally plucked up the courage to open up about her suffering.She said: Despite everything he’d put me through, I felt like Anthony was the only person I had left so I couldn’t tell the police about the rapes.Becoming a mother made me realise the impact of Anthony’s abuse. I knew he couldn’t get away with what he’d done to me.Gorringe was convicted of a total of  sex offences, including three counts of rape against Lisa and two against a teen boy - and one count of causing child prostitution.He was jailed for  years, with an eight-year licence extension. It means that he can be recalled to prison on his release up to the age of . Gaynor was jailed for six years for rape.Sentencing, Recorder Stephen Lennard described Gorringe as a dangerous offender.He said: You are a predatory and manipulative sexual deviant who stopped at nothing to obtain what you wanted.Lisa is now trying to move on with her le and hopes by speaking out, she can inspire other victims to do the same.She said: “It was a relief. Anthony picked me out at the supermarket, groomed, assaulted and exploited me.“He’s a monster. Now I’m trying to move on with my le.“I just hope that my story gives others the courage to speak out.

We need another show with a big house and a strong, silent, topless gardener who gallops around searching for love, fulfilment and all that toss.”So we’ve now got this six-part series fronted by Tom Bateman, who actually made a promising start to playing soldier-turned-trader John Beecham.He got shot.I’d have run the closing titles right there and then and promised viewers: “ITV willin about , when it’s got some new ideas.”According to the caption, however, “three years later” John Beecham was back and he’d brought his extended family with him to fill the big house.They include: His dear old racist mum, played by Mrs Patmore off Downton, a motherless baby, wayward brother Daniel, some pot-stirring French git called General Castillion and two underwhelming bits of female love interest, who won’t get any bloke switching over from Love Island in a hurry. Also present is Citizen Khan himself, Adil Ray, who’s moved in next door wearing a glued-on beard that last saw serious action in Carry On Up The Khyber.So I hope no one was expecting a laugh, or a plot. Because Beecham House hasn’t really got one, apart from the baby issue and Beecham’s grovelling desire to be granted a trading licence, which both generate lots of sarky backchat from the locals, but not much .It all stands or falls then, almost entirely, on the leading character.And, oh boy, does this one ever fall.As absolutely everyone’s noticed, for the want of charisma they’ve had to dress the poor bloke up as Indiana Jones, which can’t be a lot of fun in that climate.Even with the overcoat, cowboy hat and women throwing themselves at him, John’s brother still thinks he’s “the dullest man in Delhi”.The thing that really weighs him down, though, is Empire guilt. The righteous berk can hardly look at an Indian without apologising.“Your Imperial Highness, I implore you judge me by my actions not my flag.”“I am not like my countrymen.” “Their hypocrisy sickens me.” “The East India company’s policy of expansion is shameful.” “I love your country and believe India should be ruled by Indians.”  He’s so woke he could be reading last night’s Channel  News.An approach that’s unlikely to win the show many friends, I’d have thought, or stop the more right-on viewers accusing him of having “big white saviour syndrome”.Ultimately, though, I have absolutely no real idea whether John Beecham will strike a chord with the viewers, because, like most shows broadcast in the Sunday night pm to pm slot, I am not part of the target female audience.All I’m meant to do is sit dumbly and join in the apologetic Empire chorus.I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m not sorry at all.TIPPING Point, Ben Shephard: “In Only Fools And Horses, who plays the character known as Del Boy ”Ben: “David Frost.”Fteen To One, Sandi Toksvig: “What is the two-word term for a flashing orange globe mounted on a striped pole, used at pedestrian crossings, named after a s minister of transport ”Kresha: “Traffic light.”And Love Island, Molly-Mae: “What is the capital of France ”PSYCHOPATH With Piers Morganrequires expectations to be managed, because it’s barely a minute old when Porky-Talkie reveals: “The prison considers Paris Bennett so dangerous they insist I interview him behind toughened glass.”Andthat’s not health-and-safety gone mad, I dunno what is, frankly.RE: Love Island. If Joe and Lucie were “Jucie” and Jordan and Anna “Jordanna”, did that make Elma and Scottish Anton “Elma Fud” NEVER a good sign when you can tell a show’s going to be a disaster just from the furniture.But that was the case with last Tuesday’s big political bun fight, on BBC, which looked more like a dating show or fire sale at Louis Walsh’s gaff than a debate to decide Our Next Prime Minister.It sounded like it as well, from the way host Emily Maitlis kicked off, barking: “Five men. One job.” A phrase I don’t think I’ve heard any presenter utter since Kerry Katona was fronting ElimiDate, back in .Long before it got to air, Maitlis and the BBC had also clearly decided Boris was the “Islamo- phobic” booby prize, because not one of the researchers saw any warning signs being given off by Abdullah, from Bristol, who’d deactivated his Twitter before appearing on the show. The prize guy, naturally, was meant to be Rory Stewart, who liberal political commentators all think would make a great Conservative Party leader, in the same way they probably think Iggy Pop would make a great lead singer of One Direction.Turned out, though, he’s a fidgeting little oddball who was political toast long before he sighed at Boris: “I’m sure, like me, you’ve been in Enniskillen sitting with sheep farmers.”So, by the end of the night, an attempted BBC stitch-up had accounted for: Rory Stewart, one anti-semite, from Bristol, some other bug-eyed Corbyn cultist demanding an early election and probably Emily Maitlis’ credibility as well.Boris, meanwhile, just ploughed on regardless.Well done, everyone.Celebrity Crystal Maze, Gemma Collins: “Just being honest, it’s an honour for you to have me.”And The Last Leg, Alex Brooker: “The problem with me swimming The Channel is I can’t swim.”Problem how ON Thursday’s Shopping With Keith Lemon, former market trader Rob Beckett claimed: “I used to sell compost and you can’t up-sell a bag of s***, can you ”Yet it never stopped him trying on All Together Now.IT’S nearly six months since that great foghorning orca, Gemma Collins, last made an exhibition of herself on television.So I suppose we were overdue Friday’s appearance on Celebrity Crystal Maze, where she rumbled round the course, like Indiana Jones’ concrete ball, alongside Carol Vorderman, Ellie Taylor, Rick Edwards and her on off boyfriend Arg.And how that pair avoided wedging themselves inside one of the show’s duct shafts will remain for ever one of the Channel  show’s great mysteries.Gemma bellowed over everyone, insulted her co-stars, threw a hissy fit inside one virtual reality game – “Nah, sorry. Stop the game” – and told host Richard Ayoade: “You must be clever ’cos I’ve got the mind of a genius and you’ve made me laugh.” She also attempted to create some sort of mystique around “The GC” tag, claiming it was nothing to do with her initials and inviting alternative suggestions from Carol, who remained diplomatically silent, evenI’d swear you could see in the thought bubble above her head  . . . “Gigantic consonant vowel consonant consonant.”THE Real Chernobyl proving the perfect accompaniment to Sky Atlantic’s show of the year.Susanna Reid’s digestive tract going into deep spasm when Geoffrey Boycott asked her out for lunch, on another unmissable Good Morning Britain.Top Gear’s Chris Harris attempting to drink a glass of water while being electric-shocked by Freddie Flintoff and Paddy McGuinness.And Alien Fun Capsule host Harry Hill responding to Stephanie Beacham name-dropping former Dynasty husband Charlton Heston: “Yeah, Charlton Heston. He was slumming it a bit after Ben Hur, wasn’t he ”ITV has just one brilliant comedy show. Harry Hill’s Alien Fun Capsule, co-written by Paul Hawksbee and Dan Maier.Slightly to my surprise, I’ve learned it also has a Head of Comedy called Saskia Schuster, who’s just told something called the Diverse Festival – and what a laugh riot that sounds – she will no longer commission shows written only by men.In the great sweep of ITV history, the possibility exists, of course, that someone has made a more stupid, pointless, self-defeating, virtue-clogged, brain-fart of a commitment than this one.It’s just that I can’t think of it at the moment.LAURA Bassett: “She had her arms by her side behind her body.”Casey Stoney: “Cameroon have got that no-lose attitude, eventhey lose.”Jordan Nobbs: “If England keep believing, the second half will come.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Resign!” were directed at the homelessness minister Heather Wheeler.In an email written before she took up the role, Wheeler described rough sleepers in her constituency as “the traditional type, old tinkers”.The words were leaked and, lo, the outrage flowed hot and predictable. The Big Issue Foundation’s chief executive raged that such language, “has no place in this day and age” and so Wheeler should stand down.A travellers’ charity called her words “racist”, adding that “Irish traveller children should not have to grow up in a society where government ministers show such contempt for their culture”.Yes, Wheeler’s language was wince-worthy, but the leap to “racism” highlights the way race is used as a shield to protect the lestyles of some gypsy, Roma and traveller people from legitimate criticism.Recognised in the Equality Act of  as ethnic minorities, a force field of cultural sensitivity surrounds them. Any discussion of their culture can be labelled racist.Recent reports have found that travellers have it worse than the rest of us: Higher infant and maternal mortality rates higher prevalence of depression higher rates of chronic illness.They are likely to die more than a decade earlier than non-travellers.The educational outcomes for their children are terrible: The lowest attainment of all ethnic groups throughout their school years.They are far more likely to be excluded, and while  per cent of white British children stay in education past , only  per cent of Irish traveller children do.Officialdom’s response to these findings has been to blame officialdom or racial discrimination.The chairwoman of the Commons Women and Equalities Committee, Maria Miller, thinks travellers have been “comprehensively failed by policymakers and public services for far too long”.Always, the blame is directed at “the system”.Always, there is the retreat into the safe language of “vulnerable” people and “marginalised communities”, because politicians are terried of asking dficult questions about why travellers are over-represented in prison, or why many of their children are failing at school.Such questions would only spark accusations of racism and discrimination.This is not to suggest that gypsies, Roma and travellers live free from prejudice.There is discrimination which is real and cruel: Allegations of holiday camp operators having traveller blacklists pubs refusing to serve traveller families children bullied in school.Yet whose interests do we servewe pretend that all of this is down to straightforward racism The usually sensible Trevor Phillips, former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, has said that for gypsies and travellers: “Great Britain is still like the Deep South for black people in the Fties.”His analogy fails because it suggests the prejudice suffered is all about ethnic heritage, unconnected to the lestyle pursued by many travellers. This is nonsense.Though politicians will not dare say it, many in this country have negative perceptions of these groups because of their experience of illegal encampments on their local playing field: The littering, disruption and what might politely be termed “antisocial behaviour”.They see a group of people refusing to live by the laws the rest of us abide by: Trespassing on land with the police seemingly powerless to stop them breaking locks with no one prepared to arrest them parking on private property and not being towed away.It’s not racism driving this anti-traveller sentiment.It is fury that one community seems to live apart from the rules that govern the rest of us.The authorities seem pitully weak when it comes to evicting these camps. Councils must assess the welfare needs of those on the site before they can get an eviction order.Public money is sprayed on legal fees before the caravans move to a dferent illegal site, where the whole thing starts again.The authorities’ methods might be motivated by a desire not to “marginalise” travellers further, but it isn’t working.We need an approach which, while reconciling travellers’ desire to live on the move, recognises the desire of the rest of us to see the rules of the land enforced fairly.Part of this approach must be to make the process of evicting illegal camps surer and swter.But it’s no use simply wielding this stick without a carrot.The complementary action must be a building programme to create more authorised traveller pitches.Critically, each could have contact points with the local authority, with education and health systems, to catch these families in the net of public services .With more information on who lives where, the authorities could keep better tabs on who is educating their children, who is paying council tax, and so on.This issue may not make the hustings in the Tory leadership campaign, but it matters to the kind of country we are.Sensitivity to dferent cultures is right, butobjectionable or illegal behaviour cannot be dealt with for fear it will look racist, we are in a very strange place indeed.Giving one group a politically correct free pass denied to others is not fair, it is discrimination.Conservatives always talk about the importance of everyone “playing by the same rules”.Here’s a chance for the next leader to show he means it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He always had a story to tell and was very popular, well-known, and everyone loved him.Mr Kingdoms other son, Craig, told the inquest his father had been using his digger for about seven years, and said: I was surprised at the accident, knowing dads skill and ability.John Snow, a forensic vehicle examiner, said the exposed side of the cab which pinned Mr Kingdom down would have had a door when it was manufactured, but had been removed.A report by Hitachi UK found a combination of events had led to the digger being out in a dangerous and unstable condition, which led to it overturning.The report said the weight and size of a . tonne oak log Mr Kingdom was attempting to move with the digger was beyond the capacity of the machine, which had been operated on an incline before it slid down a hill and overturned.Assistant coroner Luisa Nicholson said: It seems because the weight he was moving was too heavy for the digger to deal with, with the incline of the land, it caused it to topple over.She gave a conclusion of accidental death.Before becoming a film-maker, Mr Kingdom worked as a farmer, quarryman, forestry worker and gravedigger."},{"url":null,"title":"gone is bumbling boris now comes mr slick boris ditches the bluffing for smooth performance as girlfriend sprinkles her magic dust","story":"But the snap of Boris Johnson arriving for tea at the Royal Horticultural Society in Surrey today tells a story of just how much the man who could be our next PM has been changed by his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds.He stands in a smart, uncrumpled suit with hardly a hair out of place. It is a sign of the increasingly professional PR operation which Symonds has brought to Boris’ campaign.One of the things which has always endeared Boris to the public has been his refusal to obey the normal rules of public le.Where other politicians go around spouting slogans and with outfits chosen by professional image-makers, Boris has always been happy to appear as his own dishevelled self.His hair is famously a mess and his clothes never quite fit.Where other MPs give the impression as having prepared every word before they speak, Boris has always spoken with flowery language, often throwing in a word or two of Latin.What’s more, he has always been attracted to television cameras like a moth to a lightbulb, never turning down an opportunity to promote himself.But with his letime ambition of being Prime Minister finally on the verge of being realised, it is suddenly a very dferent Boris that we are seeing. Enter: Mr Slick.He has become shy, rationing media appearances to the bare minimum he thinks he can get away with.When he does appear, he is smarter, less rambling and more inclined to speak in prep-prepared phrases.It isn’t hard to spot the new influence in his le.Although only  -  years younger than Boris himself - Carrie Symonds already has a career as PR chief for Conservative Central Office behind her. She now works for Bloomberg.But asher day job weren’t challenging enough, she has an even more important evening and weekend job: tidying up Boris. It is a job she has taken to with great relish.Perhaps stung by Jeremy Hunt’s accusation that he is a coward for avoiding TV debates, Boris had a full day of engagements today – including interviews with LBC and TalkRadio as well as a walkabout in Richmond, West London and tea at the Royal Horticultural Society in Wisley.Besides his tidier appearance – his short hair is now always tucked in - there is a big change in Boris’ body language.While the new Boris gestures with his hands just as enthusiastically as the old one, he has introduced a new gesture – clenched fists – to give the impression of determination.Unlike the old Boris, he managed to sit through a half-hour interview on LBC without once ruffling his hair.He is much more guarded with language. On LBC, host Nick Ferrari questioned him  times on the origin of the photograph of him and Carrie in the Sussex garden.Where the old Boris would have answered the question with humour, now he evaded it altogether, always beginning with the same phrase: “What people really want to know about…”It is a sign that he had been coached specically in how to reply to that question.Gone is the bluffing. Gone is the bumbling. He is no longer winging his way through his interviews – he is sticking to a very carefully-worded script.The closest he came today to courting controversy was to tell TalkRadio that Britain will leave the EU on October  “do or die”.It appeared to be a clear commitment to a No Deal exit on that datehis other plans fall through, something which he has previously avoided saying. The political world should take it seriously – because there are signs he now means everything he says.When talking about his time as Mayor of London, the old Boris would have stuttered and launched into talking about his achievements with great rhetorical flourish.The new Boris, by contrast, has slipped into a habit of other politicians – he ran off a list of statistics which he hoped would present his time at City Hall in good light.Gone is the self-deprecation that was such a trademark of the old Boris. Not once in his appearances over the past couple of days – which included a TV interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg - has he made a joke at his own expense.While the old Boris would have avoided slogans, the new Boris twice used the words “infrastructure, education, technology” – which indicates it is a phrase dreamed up by his campaign team and which he has been instructed to repeat at every opportunity.On Nick Ferrari’s show he made a couple of apologies – one for “the offence I’ve caused” describing niqab-wearers as looking like letterboxes and bank robbers, and one for the government’s social care policies.Boris is no stranger to apology – it was has always been part of his self-deprecating character. But there was an uncharacteristic sincerity in his words.Towards the end of the TalkRadio studio, his careful PR act seemed to be unravelling a bit.He ruffled his hair twice, started rambling that he relaxed in his spare time by making buses from cardboard boxes and couldn’t remember the last sports match he watched other than an England cricket match at which he fell asleep and couldn’t remember who England’s opponents had been.It was a brief glimpse of the old Boris – one which we are unlikely to be seeing much of in futurehe succeeds in achieving his ambition of reaching Downing Street."},{"url":null,"title":"may to stay one extra day","story":"No yesterday confirmed that Mrs May will leave office on the afternoon of Wednesday July .That will be a full  hours after the winner of the Tory leadership contest is announced by Conservative bosses, on the morning of Tuesday July .The revelation came after Mrs May’s officials conferred with the two challengers for her job, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt.As The Sun revealed yesterday, CCHQ also confirmed the ballot of the , Tory party members will close on the preceding Monday evening, with counting of the votes done overnight.The PM’s official spokesman said: “We would expect the transition to the new Prime Minister to take place on the Wednesday afternoon, after Prime Minister’s Questions”.That date means Mrs May will have served three years and  days as Premier, making her the rd longest of the  Prime Ministers that Britain has had.Tomorrow she will overtake ’s PM Neville Chamberlain, who served two years and  days.But Mrs May won’t now overhaul s leader James Callaghan, who had three years and  days in power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Tory leadership frontrunner was repeatedly put on the spot about the suspicious image by LBC presenter Nick Ferrari – who pointed out his hair was longer in the shot than now. But Mr Johnson batted away each question as he fidgeted in his chair, like he has about the furious row with Carrie, , at her flat in South London last week where police were called.And in another rambling radio chat, he compared himself to Greek statesman Pericles of Athens, told how he likes to make buses out of wooden wine crates and vowed to take Britain out of the EU on October  in a “do or die” Brexit – despite the economic disaster a no-deal will bring. Many believe the staged photo of him and Carrie gazing longingly into each others’ eyes was a cynical bid to boost his image after their bust-up dented his lead in the Tory leadership polls. Pressed by Ferrari on the snap, Mr Johnson ­blustered: “It’s not a state secret. It’s just something I don’t want to get into. Why should I ” The host refused to give up on his grilling but the former Foreign ­Secretary added meekly: “If I may say so, this conversation is descending into farce. The longer we spend on things extraneous to what I want to do… the bigger the waste of time.” Mr Johnson also declined to say whether he was aware at the time the photos had been circulated and published on the front of the Evening Standard. He said: “There are all sorts of pictures of me on the internet that pop up from time to time.”  Ferrari confronted him with ­yesterday’s Mirror’s front page, asking: “Are you happy with the majority of front pages ” But Mr Johnson claimed not to have seen them. Mr Johnson’s team have denied he staged the photos and allies tried to blame former Tory spin chief Carrie for their release. He has remained tight lipped about the row at his lover’s Camberwell home, in which worried neighbours heard her screaming “get off me” and “get out of my house”. But he finally acknowledged it while he was on the campaign trail in Surrey Hills, near Croydon, yesterday. A woman told him: “We thought you were the best from the word go,” before adding with a grin: “Just don’t have any more rows.” Mr Johnson replied: “No more rows. No, no, no. All quiet, all quiet.”   In another interview, with ­TalkRADIO’s Ross Kempsell, he was askedhe was not Boris Johnson , which figure from history would he be.He replied: “I’ve always greatly admired Pericles of Athens because he was the guy who said that politics was about the many, not the few. He was the first to use exactly that… a great orator. And, uh, he, uh, it was said that he thundered and ­lightened when he spoke.” Speaking about how he likes to unwind, former London Mayor Mr Johnson – who was criticised over the £million lie on the side of his Brexit bus – said: “I get old wooden crates right, and then I paint them and, suppose it’s a box that has been used to contain two wine bottles and it will have a iding thing, I turn it into a bus.“I paint passengers enjoying ­themselves on the wonderful bus, low-carbon of the kind we brought to the streets of London.” But he gave his strongest ­commitment yet to quitting the EU on Halloween . Mr Johnson said: “We are getting ready to come out on October the st. Come what may.” His words will alarm moderate Tory backers who Mr Johnson has privately told he will not allow the UK to crash out without a deal. But in a shock move, he suggested he could even ignore Parliamentit voted to reject the no-deal plan he was pursuing. Mr Johnson said: “It would be up to the Prime Minister of the day.“I have myself to decide under the current terms of the extension that we have to apply for such an ­extension.” Later, Mr Johnson was slapped down by his Tory leadership rival Jeremy Hunt about his Brexit position. He had written to the Foreign Secretary asking him to commit to leaving the EU by Halloween “no matter what”.But Mr Hunt – who accused Mr Johnson of “cowardice” for ducking out of a leadership TV debate with him – branded October  “a fake deadline” and said he would give an answer onlyhe agreed to turn up for the live clash. He tweeted: “Hi Boris, it’s good to talk. “But no need for snail-mail, why not turn up to Sky tonight and I’ll give you full and frank answers ” The show had to be scrapped because of Mr Johnson’s no show. Mr Johnson, who was spotted wearing the same pair of socks at a hustings on Saturday and again during radio interviews yesterday, has recruited Mark Fullbrook – the man behind Zac Goldsmith’s “racist” London mayoral campaign – to run the final weeks of his bid for No.It was confirmed the new Tory leader will be announced on Tuesday July .

The Riverside Group, which manages , homes across the UK, called for the standard five-week wait for a first payment to be slashed under the new benefit. A survey of  of its residents showed % saw financial hardship while waiting for their first UC payment. More than three quarterssaid they relied on loans from family, friends or a private firm. Some % saw an increase in debt and % turned to food banks, according to the online and phone survey. Meanwhile the social housing giant claimed the average arrears for its residents on Universal Credit were £ - compared to £ for those claiming other benefits.  Tory ministers insist families do not have to wait five weeks because they can be paid an advance - worth up to a whole monthaposs total benefit. However, these advances are deducted from future Universal Credit payments over  months. Meanwhile latest figures show % of new Universal Credit claims are not fully paid on time. That drops to % once all UC claims are included. One resident, -year-old Hazel Brown, said she was anxious and scared I could lose my home after moving to Universal Credit. Hazel, from Carlisle, said she fell into £, of arrears telling the housing association: At the time I wasn’t in a good place with my mental health. I couldn’t cope with the process even though I was worried about falling behind with my rent. I was frightened and confused.”  Riverside Group strategy director Hugh Owen said: Our findings clearly show that our tenants are experiencing increased financial dficulty because of the wait for Universal Credit. The five week wait means that many people are going without food or heating and are getting into debt to cover their bills. The housing association is the latest to join calls to cut the five-week wait led by the Trussell Trust foodbank charity. Trussell Trust chief executive Emma Revie said: This wait is five weeks too long – ending it must be the government’s first priority.” The five week wait was cut from six weeks last year but calls to cut it further have been rebuffed amid fears of huge cost and bureaucracy. In January DWP chief Amber Rudd said: At the moment Iaposm satisfied with what weaposve got but Iaposm going to keep it under review. A DWP spokeswoman said: “With Universal Credit no one has to wait five weeks to be paid, as your first payment is available as an advance on day one, and % of Universal Credit payments are made in full and on time.\u2028 “Many people join Universal Credit with pre-existing arrears but research shows that number falls by a third after four months. And the simpler system means , families are now getting on average £ more a month.” "},{"url":null,"title":"gay mp says were not","story":"NewsGay MP says were not getting back in the closet as she defends LGBT teachingAngela Eagles voice broke with emotion when speaking during a debate on parental involvement in teaching linked to the Equality Act ShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video gay-mp-insists-were-not-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA gay MP appeared close to tears as she challenged those protesting against LGBT teaching, insisting: We arenapost going to get back in the closet.Labour former minister Angela Eagle, who was the first openly gay female MP when she came out in , said such education is not propagandising or about trying to turn people gay, but about respecting their rights to have an equal welcome in school and not be bullied.Ms Eagleaposs voice broke with emotion when speaking during a debate on parental involvement in teaching linked to the Equality Act , called by a Labour colleague who has defended campaigners protesting against LGBT equality teaching at a Birmingham primary school. Anderton Park has been at the centre of a series of school gate protests in recent months, leading to a court injunction banning demonstrations inside an exclusion zone around the site. Roger Godsf, MP for Birmingham Hall Green which is home to the school, raised concerns about the level of consultation with parents. He said those who protested had some valid reasons for doing so, claiming the headteacher seemed totally unwilling to have meetings with the parents to address their concerns and to seek a compromise way of resolving the conflict.  He described the protesters as mostly young mothers, adding they have done nothing wrong, other than be good mothers who want to express concerns about what their children are telling them.    Mr Godsf, who was previously reprimanded by Labouraposs chief whip after backing the campaigners, concluded his speech with an apology for any offence caused by what he has said or written, including to members of the LGBT community in Birmingham and across the country. He was also heckled throughout his speech by Labour colleagues and others. Speaking in the Commons, Ms Eagle said of teaching sex and relationship education in schools: If we had have done it generations ago there would have been an awful lot of much happier and well adjusted people than those that have been monstered in the way that they have for the way that they are in a system that was disfigured by the effects of section . Ms Eagle added: And yet here we are in the middle of a similar kind of moral scare which is being whipped up by people who have a dferent agenda to the well being of children and their adjustment to the facts and experience of st century le in the UK. Ms Eagle became visibly upset and appeared close to tears as she spoke in the chamber, telling MPs: We know that the motivations of some of those involved in this are reactionary and they are tous to an era where LGBT people should get back in the closet and hide and be ashamed of the way they are.  We arenapost going to get back in the closet or hide or be ashamed of the way we are and nor are we going to allow a generation of pupils that are now in school to go through what the pupils in the s had to go through because this chamber let them down and nor are we going to allow this to happen in the name of religion. Labour former minister Chris Bryant spoke about progress made, but said: We will fight - not physically of course, weaposll do it probably with drag queens and feather boas, and all the stereotypes you can gather, and rugby players and football players, one day, please God, and we will fight to make sure this is not rolled back. Labour MP Stephen Doughty suggested the protests at the school were due to a small number of iniduals whipping this up, creating a myth and creating fear.    Opening the debate, Mr Godsf said some aspects specic to teaching of sexuality were not popular with more socially conservative parents and also challenged allegations of homophobic hatred against the campaigners. He also said: I regret the controversies which have arisen around the two schools in Birmingham. I believe they could have been avoidedthe schools had taught the provisions of the Equality Act in dferent ways and taken the parentsapos concerns into account. For my part, I apologise unreservedly for any offence caused to any person of whatever sexual orientation by anything Iaposve said or written. In particular, I apologise unreservedly to members of the LGBT community in Birmingham and throughout the country for anything I may have said or written which has caused offence to them. I can assure you it most certainly was not intended. Education minister Nick Gibb said the Government had introduced the regulations for making relationships and sex educationcompulsory in schools and was determined to press ahead with the policy.    The guidance he added had been very carefully crafted and written in order to build the widest possible consensus for this policy. He said: And I would say that those people who are opposed to it are at the other end of that consensus and Iaposm afraid itaposs unlikely that we will bring those extreme ends of the debate into that consensus. Referring to the situation in Birmingham he said: So we are working very hard to try to assuage concernsyou like, but ultimately we will be on the side of the headteacher in making these decisions because we do believe that ultimately the content of the curriculum is a matter for schools.

A study of , UK parents of children aged  or under revealed an alarming proportion of UK children who could have found themselves at risk of death or serious injury. One in  parents have had four or more children sat across one row of seats in the car while one in five let their child sit on a cushion rather than a booster seat. And  per cent said they had transported someone aposs child without a child seat. The survey was carried out by OnePoll for the car manufacturer SEAT to highlight the risks posed by youngsters not being strapped in correctly. Under the current law, children aged up to  years old or cm tall are, with a few exceptions, legally obliged to use a child seat when travelling in a car.  Drivers currently face a fine of up to £ and three penalty points for using the wrong restraint. But the incorrect use – or lack of use – of a child seat can have devastating consequences. In a mph collision, the injury sustained by a child weighing kg who gets thrown from a seat is similar to falling from a three-storey height. Almost , children aged  or under were injured while travelling in a car in , according to the Department for Transport, with  killed. However, just one fth of parents are confident about the rules regarding children and car seats. One third of parents polled admitted using a car seat designed for an older child, while  per cent have used an incorrectly installed child seat.  But three quarters of parents think the government should do more to raise awareness of car seat regulations, with  per cent worried they might inadvertently break the law regarding child seats. Javier Luzon, from the SEAT vehicle safety development department, said: “According to research from Spain’s Traffic Department, the dference between correct and incorrect child seat use can reduce the risk of casualty by  per cent and injuries by  per cent. “The survey by OnePoll revealed  per cent of parents are worried they have not fitted a child seat correctly. All they need to do is follow some basic rules. “It is crucial to use the seat which is certied for the child’s height and weight, as the design of each one meets the specic requirements to protect children’s bodies. “Children should always travel in the rear seats. This is by far the safest place to travel.    “It is also important children face the rear for as long as possible. In the event of a frontal impact, a baby’s neck cannot support the weight of its head when propelled forward. “Make no exception during short trips. For trips lasting only a few minutes, many children are placed in seats while still wearing a coat or even a backpack, which are major obstacles for the correct operation of the safety harness. “Even though the trip is a short distance, you should never forget safety is a priority from the moment you set out.” The OnePoll survey also revealed  per cent didn’t know an adult seatbelt could potentially cause serious injury to a child. And  per cent of parents werenapost aware that a child under cm tall could, in the event of a crash, slide under an adult seatbeltthe lap strap is too high over their abdomen. As a result of the findings, SEAT has released a safety video listing the top ten tips for travelling with children in vehicles. SEAT’s  golden rules for transporting children in your car:Use a certied child seat according to height and weight Always use the rear seats rather than the front Fasten the child seat correctly Tighten the straps on the harness Ensure the seat faces the rear for as long as possible Make no exceptions during short trips No outerwear of backpacks Place all equipment in the boot Lead by example In the event of an accident, remove the child from the car in their seat"},{"url":null,"title":"uk chip shop opening branch","story":"NewsUK chip shop opening branch in China after being flooded with tourists from countryScotts Fish and Chips often gets more than  visitors a week from the Asian countryShareCommentsByLucy Thornton:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsScotts Fish and Chips often gets more than  visitors a week from the Asian country \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA chip shop in Yorkshire has become such a hit with Chinese tourists the owner is opening a branch there.

Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing.

The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle.

Glenn Porter started proceedings with a special award for #assisting mark layers# to the competitor who got tangled up in one of the race marks.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

skies of June burst through threatening rain clouds on Sunday evening and out marched this yearrsquos Beltane Festival Principals onto Peebles High Street, the festal colours of red and white fluttering in the breeze above them.Father Tony Lappin was a newly welcomed guest to this spectacle only a year prior. But the honour of being installed as the Warden of the Cross Kirk was his on Sunday.Cornet Gregor McGrath led the parade of Principals, Court, Committee, Ex-Cornets, their Lasses and Peebles Callants to the medieval ruins of the Cross Kirk which comes to le annually to host an annual congregation for the townrsquos religious ceremony which marks the start of the Beltane Festival.A wide iety of local organisations flying their flags marched to the ancient grounds for the Inaugural Service where retiring Warden of the Kirk, Rev Barry Hughes, carried out his last official act in Peebles.Rev Hughes left the town six months ago to take up ministry at St Markrsquos Church in Raploch in Stirling.He said: ldquoPeebles and Raploch are in many ways as dferent as two places can possibly be ndash they are dferent socially, economically, geographically.\"Peebles is a small Borders town, full of history, whereas The Raploch is a large council estate which sprung up in the middle of the th century.ldquoBut Peebles and The Raploch have one very important thing in common ndash the strength of their communities. You only have to look round this evening to see that.\"During the  years I lived here I was always overwhelmed by the welcome given to us, and the many opportunities to be involved in all aspects of town le.\"It has been the same in Raploch, even after only six months, anda place is defined by its community spirit, then both Peebles and The Raploch score very highly indeed.ldquoSo I hope you will permit me to say a huge thank you on behalf of myself and my family for the years we have lived here ndash to all I have worked with and met through church, Scouting, Beltane, schools, Tweed Theatre, running and many other ways, thank you, and Peebles will always have a very special place in my heart.Introducing this yearrsquos Warden of the Cross Kirk, Rev Hughes told the congregation of Father Lappinrsquos journey to becoming the Parish Priest at St Josephrsquos.He added: ldquoHis first calling was as a curate in West Lothian and then in  West Lothianrsquos loss became Peeblesrsquo gain.ldquoTony, I know from my friends at St Josephrsquos that you have made a big impact during your first year ndash indeed even before you came here a friend of mine in West Lothian messaged me and said lsquoPeebles is very lucky ndash you are getting Fr Tonyrsquo.\"Speaking to one of your parishioners last week I was told about how the parish feels re-invigorated and everyone is looking ahead with joy.After officially being installed, Father Lappin delivered his address and chose two readings from the New Testament, the first being Luke :-, when Jesus speaks the parable of the Good Samaritan and what it means to be a good neighbour.He said: ldquoDuring Beltane Week, Peebles celebrates being a community, and one of the important aspects of a good and healthy community is our commitment to be good neighbours to one another.\"We are called to do for others, especially those who need a helping hand, what the Good Samaritan did in this reading.The second reading was from the First Letter to the Corinthians.Father Lappin explained: ldquoThis tells us that the Holy Spirit gives us many gts in order that we might share these gts for common good.\"We are told that the Kingdom of God is like a body made up of many parts, with each part needing the other parts so that the body canproperly.ldquoAgain, an important aspect of a good and healthy community is recognition by all its members as to their inidual skills and talents, and then a commitment to share these skills and talents freely in order that the whole community may benefit.\"Peebles is full of people with wonderful things to offer.A selection of children from the local primary schools and unormed organisations spoke about how they contribute to their community.Father Lappin closed with an important message to Peebleans: ldquoAs we go into this great week of community celebration, let us be mindful of what it means to be a good neighbour to others, especially to those who need our help.\"And, to be mindful of our own skills, talents and gts, so that we can share these for the building up of the community and the common good.The rain stayed firmly in the clouds for this majestic outdoor ceremony and that is just where this community wants it to stay until their Queen is crowned tomorrow ."},{"url":null,"title":"trial-told-how-peebles-health-worker-followed-girls-to-watch-them-urinate","story":"THE trial of a health worker from Peebles has heard how he followed young girls to watch them urinate.And one described how he touched her inappropriately.NHS dietician Peregrine Burgess is facing a total of  charges involving  alleged victims -

regions first Premier Inn.And now that developers have dropped controversial proposals to include a new supermarket, the plans are being given the thumbs up from David Parker.Mr Parker, who represents Leaderdale and Melrose at the local authority, told us: \"I am pleased that Newland Assets have listened carefully to the representations they have received concerning the Borders Gateway proposals.\"A Class  food retail store was very much against local and national planning policy for the site in Tweedbank as it introduced out of town shopping but the developer has listened carefully to ious concerns on this issue and removed it.ldquoThe new proposals have taken on board many observations made so far during the planning process and the revised plans are better in terms of design, road layout and visual impact.\"I am very excited about the economic impact this development could have on the wider Borders economy.ldquoSecuring a Premier Inn for the Scottish Borders will help put our region firmly on the tourism map and the economic impact of Premier Inn and the potential for other investors to follow them, is something which must be grasped.ldquoThe revised Borders Gateway proposals will complement the work taking place to develop the Tweedbank Innovation Park and will sit comfortably alongside the public and private sector projects which are underway at Tweedbank at present.\"The pound million Borders Gateway development also includes a BP filling station, a Costa drive-thru coffee shop, and a MS kiosk.And it is expected that the new outlets will create up to  jobs.Although the wider vision of the development had been welcomed, the supermarket part of the plans had come in for criticism.And Newland Assets revised their plans to omit the supermarket earlier this year.Councillor Parker added: ldquoBorders Gateway has the overwhelming support of the public and many businesses in the area and now that the food retail plans have been dropped there is no reason why these proposals should not be fully endorsed by the planners and backed by Scottish Borders Council.\"The economic advantages of this proposal signicantly outweigh the very small number of policy considerations which are left.ldquoAlthough it was right for the planners to raise concerns about the previous proposal, now that the developer has listened carefully to all the objections and amended the plans accordingly to deal with them, the Borders public simply wonrsquot understand why the council isnrsquot backing this ambitious inward investment opportunity.\"It will help bring new jobs and secure existing jobs and undoubtedly lead to a tourism boost in the Scottish Borders.ldquoI look forward to this development receiving approval and work commencing on

ldquooptional, an investigation has found.A study by the National Audit Officefound thatNHS Property Services has no effective way of making organisations sign leases and is writing off millions of pounds in debt.It said the service was set up in a way that prevents it acting like a commercial landlord ndash meaning it cannot takelegal action, issue penalty charges, stop services or evict NHS bodies.Furthermore, action against non-NHS tenants, including GPs, must be approved by the Department of Health and Social Careon a case-by-case basis.NHS Property Services is owned by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, and consists of , properties worth % of the entire NHS estate in terms of floor space.More than % of properties owned by the group are health centres, clinics and surgeries.Some % of tenants are NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts, while % are GPs.NAO investigators found that since  , the percentage of tenants without rental agreements in place has increased from nearly two-thirds to %.Many NHS organisations and GPs also seem to regard paying for their premises as optional, with almost pound million either written off or still unpaid, the report said.In  , the service only recovered .p for every pound it billed ndash andoutstanding debt increased from pound million in March  to pound million in March .Although GPs only occupy % of the properties, they owe % of the current outstanding debt, the study found.Overall, between   and  , the service wrote off pound million in debt.The NAO has now recommended that the DHSC works with the service to ensure its tenants agree rent payments and contracts by the end of March .Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: ldquoThe service has slowly improved the way it manages its NHS properties.ldquoHowever, more than eight years after being created, it still lacks the powers it needs to run its affairs effectively, and the accuracy of bills is still disputed.Labour MP Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Commons public accounts committee, said the report made forldquouncomfortable reading.She added: ldquoNHS Property Services Limited was undermined from the start as it did not have the powers it needs to work effectively.ldquoAs a result it has written off or not collected almost pound million since .ldquoBut Property Services is not blameless, almost pound million of its bills have been disputed by its tenants.ldquoThe Department must take urgent action to fix this broken charging framework for NHS property.Dr Richard Vautrey, chairman of the British Medical Associationrsquos GP committee, said GPs leasing buildings from NHS Property Services ldquohave seen their service and maintenance fees rise astronomically with no agreement and no proper explanation.He said it was right that GPs do not pay fees that ldquocould risk the very future of their practices and the ability to provide care for patients.He added: ldquoIndeed, this timely report, which helpfully highlights that there is no legal right or power to collect these payments, comes as we announce that we have written to NHS Property Services asking it to urgently address the service fee issue or we will consider legal action.ldquoIt is simply not the case, however ndash as this report claims ndash that GPs see paying for premises as lsquooptionalrsquo.ldquoPractices want to pay a fair and appropriate rent, but this needs to be reimbursed by clinical commissioning groups.ldquoA lack of funding in recent years means commissioners cannot keep up with sky-rocketing commercial rents demanded by NHS Property Services, and theyrsquove simply passed the problem and the cost to family doctors.A Department of Health and Social care spokesman said: ldquoNHS Property Services has helped the NHS raised overpound

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm.

modern and dynamic setting aimed at motivating and encouraging more people to get more active more often.ldquoAlthough the dry side facilities remain open at Aubigny, this extended closure of the swimming pool is not what anyone would wish.ldquoenjoy would welcome all our customers at any of our other swimming pools, which remain open.An email was sent out to enjoyleisure members which highlighted the problems.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure at East Lothian Council, echoed Mr Axonrsquos disappointment.He said: ldquoEveryone is looking forward to the completion of this renovation, which will transform the look of the pool for the benefit of the many people who use this much-loved facility.ldquoWe are disappointed that, due to a supply chain issue outwith our control, the date for the poolrsquos re-opening has been now been revised from the end of June with a new opening date of July .ldquoWe appreciate this will be frustrating for pool users who will be eagerly anticipating the poolrsquos re-opening and we are grateful for their patience and understanding.ldquoIrsquod like to assure everyone that we are working very closely with the contractor, subcontractor

and a new roof covering.Both pools ndash the four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool ndash were to be drained, with a new light ceiling covering replacing the wood cladding.A new energy-efficient lighting scheme is also to be fitted, which it is hoped will transform the look and feel of the facility.Existing wall tiles will be replaced with wall liner .The delay also means the pool will not be open ahead of the school summer holidays starting next Friday .While the pool and health suite are closed, the rest of the centre, including the gym, dance studio, sports hall and cafe, remain open.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe delay to the reopening of the Aubigny Sports Centre swimming pool will clearly be disappointing for local residents hoping to use the facilities over the school holidays.ldquoI hope East Lothian Council continues to work closely with the contractors and enjoyleisure to ensure there are no further delays.ldquoThe renovation is very welcome, but as the Haddington population grows we still need to explore how to further enhance and expand our leisure and sporting facilities to ensure they remain on a level with those

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match. Frequency should be half-hourly.Councillor Tom Trotter, who represents Haddington, backed the station bid.He said: ldquoIt is a good idea, especially with the town expanding as it is.ldquoIt would be a tremendous asset to have.However, the councillor felt it was more likely the station would have to find a new site, such as Alderston, to the north of the town.He added: ldquoIn the short-term it is unrealistic, but hopefully in the longer term things can be put in place to make it a realistic possibility.ldquoIt is a great idea and Irsquom sure it would get support from all the local ward councillors, but where it would go and how much it would cost are questions."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-prestonpans-gala-2019","story":"This year is the th anniversary of Prestonpans Childrenrsquos Gala.On gala day itself, the festivities kick off with the crowning ceremony at am at Prestonpans Community Centre.There is then a fancy-dress competition at Middleshot Square at noon before the parade heads off through the town.From Middleshot Square, it heads along Hawthorn Road and down West Loan to the war memorial, then along High Street before turning up Redburn Road, then along North Grange Avenue, where it ends at Mary Murray Park, behind the community centre.The park hosts the gala dayrsquos family fun, which includes a funfair with a host of rides, as well as old favourites such as hook the duck.There is also a vintage fire engine on display, as well as an American police car, motorbike displays, ponies, birds of prey, beat the goalie, Zorbs, safe archery, NERF guns, crazy golf, a tombola and a gala raffle, not to mention ice cream vans, tea and coffee, Mr Donut Man, crepes, waffles, hot dogs, nachos, a burger van, La Favorita pizzas, stalls selling gts, sweets and cake.Gala day marks the beginning, not the end of Prestonpansrsquo week of fun and activities.Events are as follows:Saturday, June Monday, June Tuesday, June Wednesday, June Thursday, June Friday, June "},{"url":null,"title":"bid-to-turn-former-rbs-in-north-berwick-into-a-house","story":"The townrsquos Royal Bank of Scotlandclosed in June last year.

A credible alternative to a regular PC, but at a tenth the cost,\" he said.ldquoThe vision behind Raspberry Pi  is to make a rich multimedia PC experience accessible to everyone. By offering a level of performance suitable for most users wersquove been able to do this at roughly a tenth of the cost of a traditional desktop PC.Mr Upton said there would still be some people - such as ldquohard-core gamers - for whom the Raspberry Pi would not be an acceptable replacement.But he added: ldquoFor the things most people want to do such as editing documents, searching the web or watching a few videos this will be perfectly fine.The development was welcomed by Dr Jeremy Singer, a senior lecturer in computing science at Glasgow University.He has already used previous versions of the Raspberry Pi for a host of applications at the university - including putting them into ceiling tiles to monitor light levels, background noise levels, Co levels, temperature and humidity as part of a wider efficiency drive.ldquoWhen it first came out the Raspberry Pi was very much geared towards teaching pupils about coding and hands on computing, but now it has become much more powerful and people are using it for all kinds of dferent things, he said.ldquoThis upgrade is increasing the computational power of the kit so it will be as powerful,not more powerful, than your mobile phone. The amount of memory has increased a lot too so while previous versions were quite restricted, that is no longer the case.:How women are rebooting their careers by learning art of codingldquoComputers have become everyday commodity items rather than luxuries and the idea that you can spend pound and have your own powerful computer is a very appealing one and certainly capable of doing all the things a more expensive laptop or desktop could do.Dr Singer said an interesting aspect of the Raspberry Pi was that it was still a ldquobare bones system with consumers having to purchase extra items such as a screen, mouse and keyboard. Even customers buying it as a ready made kit still have to assemble it themselves.He said: ldquoThat is a deliberate and interesting move because it shows computers are not just black boxes, but have dferent components that are brought together.ldquoWe need people to understand that computers are not magic and not something to be apprehensive about and this is something that people can play with and use without being scared of breaking it.Mr Upton created the Raspberry Pi in  while at Cambridge University, originally as an inexpensive tool to teach children how to code.Over the last  years more than  million units have been sold to a wide iety of users including computer enthusiasts, academics and businesses, often to monitor environmental factors such as temperature or to control cameras.The company currently sells six million devices a year, giving it just over two per cent of the global PC market."},{"url":null,"title":"irn-bru-is-a-symbol-of-westminsters-scottish-disconnect","story":"Thats where he, thought hed be an MP.

We... want a third runway  I mean, I cant speak for anyone I know because the topic of Heathrows third runway has absolutely never come up in conversation with friends, not at the dinner table, not at the bar, never in the office.

No self-respecting Irn Bru drinker would decant it its straight from the bottle - or can, at a push - but a true Scot would never use a glass.Irn Bru is no plaything, as surely any basic research from an advisor would find out.

This year local Scottish Fire and Rescue team will once again have a fire engine at the clinic to help draw attention to the clinic.Councillor Drever added: #The safety checks are carried out by a specially trained Good Egg Safety expert, not police officers # so people should not feel they are at risk of getting into trouble.“Rather it#s an opportunity to get some reassurance that your car seat is compatible with your vehicle, and to get tips and advice on any adjustments that would improve the car seat’s performance. We#d urge anyone who drives children about # whether that#s childminders, grandparents and parents or wider friends – to drop into the clinic. It is five or ten minutes of your time well spent.”The Good Egg Safety Child Seat clinic will be held in the Tesco car park in Kirkwall on Wednesday July , running from am to pm. There#s no need to book — just look for the Good Egg rep in the Tesco foyer, or head for the red fire engine.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They want to hear from the owners of all kinds of properties, from urban studio flats to historic country piles. From Shetland to Stranraer and Orkney to Oban, prime properties from all over Scotland will be in the frame.Jo Street, commissioner for BBC Scotland, said: “We’re delighted to announce a second series of Scotland’s Home of the Year. It isn’t just about showing off million-pound properties – it’s about truly celebrating what people have done to turn their house into a home, expressing their iniduality through their design, flair and imagination. We saw some cracking houses over the course of series one and there are far more gems to uncover for series two.”The first series of Scotland’s Home of the Year was broadcast on the new BBC Scotland channel in April and May this year.The series has since seen its audience continue to grow on iPlayer with requests to view so far hitting more than a quarter of a million – ,.The format saw three judges – architect Michael Angus, interior designer Anna Campbell-Jones and lestyle blogger Kate Spiers – travel theand breadth of Scotland to discover architectural gems and unearth some stunning interiors. Both traditional and contemporary properties were put under the microscope and judges considered everything from a one-bedroom apartment to a centuries-old country castle … and everything in between.Each home was scored on ality, distinctiveness and clever design and from seven finalists, one clear winner of series one was chosen – the White House in Kirkcudbright, Dumfries and Galloway, created by proud owner Lesley Smith and her late husband Mike.Series two will have a slightly longer run than series one with nine -minute heats, each featuring three properties from a specic part of the country. The  houses featured will then be whittled down to a final nine which will go under the spotlight in an hour-long final episode.Gerard Costello, executive producer, IWC Media said: “We are thrilled that Scotland’s Home of the Year is ing to the BBC Scotland channel. The first series was a joy to make and we have only scratched the surface of the beautul and distinctive homes Scotland has to offer. We can’t wait to get started.”If you’d like to be considered for the next series of Scotland’s Home of the Year, you can get in touch at scotlandshomes@IWCMedia copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Providing practical training for riders where they can improve their skills and understanding of risks through controlled exercises is a vital part of this strategy.“Motorcyclists are vastly over-represented in serious road injuries, so I hope that Orkney’s motorcyclists will take up this opportunity to both become a safer road user and improve their overall riding experience through better bike handling skills.”Anyone interested in attending the course should email: operationriderrefinement@scotland.pnn.police.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not content with writing just one book, he decided to author two: one will be the scuttle story in photographs, From Scuttle to Salvage, which will be launched this Thursday, June . The  other, The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet, is the more in depth story of the German Naval mutiny, and how the Fleet came to be interned in Scapa.

He is passionate about passing history on to his childrens’ generation, and says he felt that this would be a best way of reaching younger people who prefer video to text. The -minute animation has already been seen by more than , people online, and was made possible through crowdfunding and the help of numerous museums and archives, the Kirkwall Library and Archives being among them.Nick will be talking about the scuttle on June  at pm at the St Magnus Centre, where with him, many of the descendants will participate.

So many brilliant TV comedies have been dreamed up by five guys in a room and here’s another. The writers battle their way out of the room by wading through a sea of discarded pizza boxes, their only sustenance having been slipped underneath the door all the time they were finessing the funny lines. They blink at their first glimpse of sunlight in a while, and then send off the finished scripts – destination ITV.What, the same ITV which hasn’t produced a decent sitcom in what seems like  years, and certainly not a consistent run of them like the s classics Rising Damp, Man About the House, Doctor in the House, Please Sir! And The Lovers  Yes, that ITV.It would, our all-male quintet reckon, be too obvious to send their show to the BBC, even though the work stands comparison with Fleabag, WA and even The Office. Their show is perhaps not alternative enough for Channel  but equally it’s not trying too hard for a gold star for ersity it’s just funny. Hilarious, in fact. And because it deserves a big, mainstream, not-too-trendy audience it’s bypassing Netflix and the other streaming networks to possibly spark a comedy revival at a station where the only laughs in recent times have been the unintentional ones provided by Robert Peston’s hair, Simon Cowell’s hairand the clunky change of facial expression when, just before an ad break in the grisly crime drama, the lead detective realises they’ve been chasing a red herring up the wrong tree.: The greatest TV comedies of the decade so far:  TV shows you might not know were filmed in GlasgowAh, but there’s a problem. ITV no longer wants comedies written just by men. “I won’t commission anything with an all-male writing team,” head of comedy Saskia Schuster announced the other day. She painted a picture of men dominating the scene: hogging her in-tray with their scripts and outnumbering those from women by five to one, almost to the extent she has trouble getting out of her door, and of them shouting loudest during the collaborative process. “Too often the writing room is not sensitively run,” she said. “It can be aggressive and slightly bullying.”Bah, men. You can’t do anything with them, Jenny Eclair once declared from the Edinburgh Festival Fringe stage, and you can’t chop them up into little pieces, chuck them in a pot of boiling water with some carrots and call them soup. But they can be quite funny, and when they’re at their funniest and the gags are flying off the page, they iniably paint the male of the species as complete berks. They may occasionally dominate the writing room but there’s a long tradition, in the finished product we see on screen, of women dominating the kitchen , the living-room and, yes, the bedroom. Men in our comedies are never conquering heroes but hen-pecked husbands, deluded regional managers of paper firms and – most hen-pecked and deluded of all – the foreigner-bashing, Austin -thrashing snob proprietor of the hotel from hell.Fawlty Towers was a genius collaboration between a man and a woman, John Cleese and Connie Booth, writing together in the same room and they survived. That is, they didn’t kill each other, although their marriage didn’t last. Basil was terribly rude about – and in braver moments, directly to the face of – Sybill but she definitely wore the trousers in that relationship. And would anyone seeking an equal voice for women claim that in the comedy of the year so far, the central character wasn’t a beautully written portrait of a widow coping with loss, middle-age, suburban ennui, insensitive relatives, idiotic relatives and the most epicly snooty and cruel sister-in-law this side of a Mike Leigh film This was the just-finished Mum starring Lesley Manville and written by a man, Stefan Golaszewski. I don’t think Schuster would have been complaining about the lack of female input in the creative processMum was one of her shows but it was on the BBC. Fawlty Towers was a Beeb comedy, as was The Office, WA – which had the most tremendous fun sending up ersity and gender quotas – and Fleabag, admittedly the only comedy here solely penned by a woman. So where are the ITV comedies  It used to be a struggle to name a good one now it’s a struggle to name any, be they female-dominated, male-dominated or three-toed sloth-dominated. Schuster may be frustrated by the scripts she receives but ITV would seem to first have to convince writers that it is a good place to be, that it wants to make the country laugh in these gloomy times.By the way, five guys in a room  That tends to be the American model. The British model has often been two guys, one pacing around and jabbering and the other typing. Some of the greatest and most-loved and still-quoted comedies emerged from such unpromising, female-free surroundings, including Hancock’s Half Hour by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, the same duo who gave us Steptoe and Son, and Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais’ The Likely Lads.Steptoe and Son wasn’t heavy on women but the thought was there. Harold was always trying to don his velvet jacket and escape the rag and bone business and his dirty old man of a father to meet members of the opposite sex but never actually succeeded. And while Thelma in The Likely Lads was a bit of a dragon, the joke was always on Bob and Terry.But under the new diktat none of these fantastic shows would have made it onto the goggle-box and neither would Monty Python’s Flying Circus. That simply isn’t funny.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"no place for ageism in an ageing country leader comment","story":"Employers need to wake up to the fact that they need to accommodate older workers with one in four people in Britain set to be  or over by .The dramatic surge in le expectancy during the second half of the th century – thanks in large part to the NHS – still appears to be news to some British employers.For even though people are, on average, fitter and healthier than ever – and therefore capable of working beyond retiral age in many jobs – ageist attitudes persist. A report by MPs last year condemned the fact that a million people over the age of  were unemployed in the UK as an “unacceptable” waste of talent, blaming straightforward prejudice, casual ageism and unconscious bias.Despite such retrograde thinking, new figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal that more than  per cent of people aged  and over had a job in , double the level in . : MPs blame age discrimination for ‘wasted talents’ of more than million over-s: Older teachers fear being bullied out of the professionAge Scotland said one reason for this is that people want to work longer “because they love their jobs”. They may also work for one of the main reasons anybody does – the money. Many under the age of  who have failed to plan adequately for their pensions will be relying on being able to carry on working in their old age.The trouble is, as Professor Wendy Loretto of Edinburgh University pointed out, there’s a gap between “employers’ and employees’ understanding of the opportunities and practicalities of working in later le”. That gap is one we must all work to close, given that one in four people are expected to be aged  and over by . While some people in their late s will be able to carry on doing their existing job, others may not be able to continue in precisely the same role but still have useful skills to offer or perhaps will be able to perform a part-time role, but not a full-time one.Whatever the retirement age, employers need to recognise this and make the necessary changes to accommodate them. Those that do not will miss out on talented staff who offer that most vital of qualities, experience. And firms may also eventually face action from Government becausetoo many older people are economically inactive, this will become an increasing strain on the economy. Long-term success in business is based partly on identying changes in the way of the world and this one is quite simple – an ageing population means an older workforce.And, regardless of the business-sense, we should all be judged on our inidual qualities, not pre-judged on our age.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"government immigration plans are unworkable and must change stephen kerr mp","story":"Conservative MP Stephen Kerr says that while the SNPs constitutional argument is flawed,Scotlands erse needs should be accommodated.UK immigration policy must work effectively by addressing the needs of every part of the UK’s society and economy.The SNP, as usual, have framed the argument around the constitution and Scotland’s position within the UK. The truth of the matter is that the erse needs within Scotland need to be accommodated. Within a flexible policy framework based on reality rather than academic theory.The fishing communities of the northeast Scotland have far more in common with their equivalents in the southwest of England than they do with the industrial heartland of the central belt. Similarly that economy has more in common with the west midlands than the remote island communities of the Hebrides.Simply transferring responsibility for Scotland’s immigration to Holyrood as the SNP propose, entirely misses the pointof how a UK wide approach will ensure a positive environment to attract the people our economy needs. We cannot afford to have dferent systems operatingwithin a United Kingdom where people must be able to move freely around within it.: My faith makes me no less Scottish - Stephen Kerr MP That being said the current proposals for a future immigration policy will causereal damage to the UK economy and must be changed.The most obvious problem is that it excludes everyone who earns less than £, a year, classying them as “unskilled”. Some of the most skilled people I know earn less than k . With the average salary in Scotland being just under £, these proposals would wrongly classy the majority of Scots as “unskilled”.That would be a travesty. Nothing could be further from the truth. The people who run our hotels, maintain our national infrastructure and care for our elderly are skilled, they are hard working and they are compassionate.These are the qualities that we want to attract with our immigration policy. A simple salary cut off point is far too blunt an instrument to deal with the problems we have in attracting and retaining talent across the Scottish economy.The Tourism and Hospitality Sector is an excellent example. These businesses need to be able to attracttalented people from around the world.They must have the ability to grow and increase the value that tourism adds to our economy. In my constituency the hotels, tourist attractionsand the outdoor activity sector need staff who have the qualities needed.We must havean immigration policy that works for those businesses.Similarlycompanies needing pharmaceutical lab assistants, food production technicians, moulding engineers, fitters and construction staff, to name just a few, cannot afford to be excluded from accessing the people they need.To label all these people as “unskilled labour” is simply wrong.A top priority for the new Prime minister must be to insist on a flexible and adaptive immigration policy that accommodates the needs of UK business in all of its complex ersity.Whether that be agriculture, tourism, building, Care, manufacturing or any other sector it needs to take account of sectoral needs and move away from a simple earnings thresehold.By yet again focussing on constitutional arguments the SNP continue to let Scotland downand fail to stand up for our interests in the UK. We need positive engagement on the issue of immigration, a rational debate and acknowledgement that the current proposalsare unworkable.Stephen Kerr is the Conservative MP for Stirling. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in .

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

In a specially commissioned visual, the iconic clfs of Fairhead in County Antrim have been digitally transformed into an eye-catching sculpture featuring the images of local golfing greats, past and present. Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, who will all now be competing in the tournament, feature in the design, alongside former Open Champion and Portrush man Fred Daly. Engaging the talents of Hollywood digital CGI artist Mike Campau, the tongue-in-cheek stunt has been designed to reflect how Northern is truly ‘Made for Golf’, illustrated not only by our sporting talents but also in our landscapes and rugged coast. The timing of the tribute could not be more fitting as Northern Ireland golfers celebrate their recent triumphs on the course, with Rory McIlroy winning the Canadian Open by seven shots to secure his th PGA Tour title and fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowellafter finishing tied eighth on  under. Tourism NI last week marked the last official stop of a -mile community engagement campaign ‘The Epic Journey to The th Open’, and with just a month to go, Open fever is starting to take a grip of the nation as the spotlight falls on Portrush. Tourism NI Marketing Director Naomi Waite said: “With ‘Open fever’ beginning to take a hold, we wanted to honour the global golfing heroes who collectively have played a key role in bringing The th Open to Northern Ireland and, through their talent, have made Northern Ireland a growing international golf destination. It is just one of many activities we have planned to celebrate the enormous pride that the people of Northern Ireland have in the achievements of our golfing greats. “While Northern Ireland might one day boast its own ‘Mount Rushmore’ for golf, we can reassure everyone that this stunt is digital theatre and something we hope will raise a smile ahead of July.” Robin Daly, son of the late Fred Daly, said: “Our family are extremely honoured that my father is being remembered in this way. We are really looking forward to theof The Open to our shores for the first time in nearly  years and this sculpture is a wonderful tribute to the talents of these local sportspeople who have earned their place in the history book of golf.” McIlroy and McDowell will tee up at Royal Portrush alongside fellow local and former Open Champion, Darren Clarke, in front of a passionate home crowd when one of the world’s greatest sporting spectacles - The Open - s to the famous Dunluce links for the first time in nearly  years. The th Open at Royal Portrush will be beamed to over  million viewers across the world and is set to attract , spectators, with a team of , staff and  volunteers warmly welcoming visitors. Unprecedented demand from fans has led to record-breaking ticket sales and the event will be a sell-out on Championship Days for the first time.

I never thought I would have the opportunity to play in a major championship at home and I’m really looking forward to it.” Fans can still book their place at Royal Portrush on Practice Days with a limited number of new official hospitality packages also remaining on sale.

Police advice is to:• Leave the house and seek fresh air.• Treat itchy or painful skin with water.• Remove outer clothing – but not by pulling it over the head.• Remove any substance that may contact clothing or skin by using a dry absorbent material or brushing it off.Advice is also included on what signs may signal the presence of hazardous substances in the home.The leaflet also advises politicians not to engage with iniduals who may be “stalking harassing” them, either online or offline. It urges them to seek further advice on personal safety and building security from their local police force and to conduct a review of what personal information about them is available online.The leaflet explains that the advice is being forwarded for politicians to consultthey are subjected post-Brexit to “unacceptable levels of harassment and intimidation”. It continues: “In some cases, these behaviours and actions have reached the criminal threshold. The worst examples have led to violence and injury.”The most serious example of Brexit-inspired violence was the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in June  in West Yorkshire by a gun- and kne-wieldingman holding extreme pro-Britain views. Mr Ó Muilleor said: “It seems preposterous to me that the PSNI is promoting Brexit security advice compiled at the behest of a UK government which for three years has shown itself so thoroughly inept in its handling of the issue. There’s little in this that isn’t already known to most people and no reason why it couldn’t have been emailed to me rather than dispatching a police patrol. There are Catholic families in my South Belfast constituency living under the jackboot of the UVF and the flegger bully-boys. The PSNI would be better advised to protect those folk rather than wasting their time and my time with this Brexit bollox.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"squeeze on school places gets worse","story":"ALLIANCE South Belfast MLA Paula Bradshaw says a fundamental reform in the allocation of school places is needed, after figures showed a soaring demand for places in South Belfast,with well over a quarter of applicants now not getting their first choice.Ms Bradshaw revealed statistics released to her by the Education Authority outlining the number over the past five years of school admissions.In ,  pupils living in South Belfast applied for a post-primary place –  pupils were offered a place at first preference whilst  were refused.In , out of a total of  applications,  pupils were offered a place at first preference, with  refused.“The number of pupils seeking places in South Belfast post-primary schools has risen from  to  in the past five years, yet Area Planning seems to have managed to miss this completely,” explained Ms Bradshaw.“This defeats the whole purpose of Area Planning. How can it not already have been known that approximately  more pupils would be requiring places over this period  If Area Planning was unable to monitor this correctly, it is entirely unsuited for purpose. It is a complete failure of the system. “The outcome of this failure is drastic. As a consequence, we now have, for the first time, seven pupils in South Belfast not receiving any offer at all for September . Additionally, the number not receiving their first choice rising dramatically from  per cent to  per cent and this will only rise further.“With more than a fth more pupils seeking places in South Belfast than was the case just three years ago, we should have been taking action to address the shortfall in provision we knew was pending.“The increased intake at Lagan and Aquinas, of  places each, can cover only a sixth of that increase and is nothing like sufficient. So, what we are seeing is a comprehensive failure of the whole transfer system in South Belfast.“With ever more new housing in and around South Belfast, this is only going to get worse in years to come. Where is the monitoring of this  What will the requirement be five years from now  What is being done to address it  “The Alliance Party has called, and will continue to call, for a fundamental, independently-led review of education provision with a view to far-reaching transformation recommend-ations being proposed.“A high priority within this process would be a focus on improving Area Planning, so that pupils and their families are not left in the appalling situation where they are left without a school, with the ultimate solution being more educational provision either within existing schools or a new build,” added Ms Bradshaw."},{"url":null,"title":"9000 in northern ireland apply to secure status after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

UK’s withdrawal from the EU.If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market.Leo VaradkarThe Taoiseach made the remarks at the end of an EU summit in Brussels as European Council president Donald Tusk said Brexit would become “more exciting” than before with a change of British prime minister but that the EU’s position had not changed.Mr Varadkar said: “We can’t accept that alternative arrangements are an alternative to a backstop unless we can see what these alternative arrangements are, know how they would work and see them demonstrated.“That hasn’t been done yet and I don’t see that being done this side of October  which is why we certainly can’t accept the deletion of the backstop.”He added: “For us, a deal without a backstop is effectively no deal because it means that there is no legal guarantee we won’t have a hard border, there is no operable mechanism by which we can avoid a hard border, it would just be a case of trying to pull it off, which I don’t think really is much of a solution.”Mr Varadkar said EU leaders had reaffirmed that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation and they agreed that negotiations would only take place between the UK and the EU.But he said the Irish government would have an “obligation” to protect the single market in the event of a no-deal outcome.“If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market, it’s our single market, our economy and our jobs are dependent on it,” he said.“We will have to make sure that Ireland doesn’t become the back door to the European single market.”He added that the only way he could see of being sure of avoiding a hard border was through regulatory alignment.Asked about the Tory leadership race, Mr Varadkar highlighted that both of the candidates, who remain in the running to become prime minister, had voted for the Withdrawal Agreement.He said he looked forward to holding a meeting with the new prime minister and discussing potential changes to the Political Declaration.But he reiterated that there would be “no implementation period for the UKthere is no Withdrawal Agreement and there will be no Withdrawal Agreementthere’s no backstop”."},{"url":null,"title":"brexits impact on many crossborder initiatives

No formal or transparent selection process was used in her selection for appointment nor was she given a written contract of employment, statement of main terms and conditions or job description.During , following several years of signicant growth, the firm decided to consider promotions from associate solicitor grade to salaried partner. Mrs Mercer and two other colleagues were promoted to salaried partner later that year.However, the following year, when she applied for promotion to the role of an equity partner, she was told she did not meet the eligibility criteria. Mrs Mercer did not find out about the promotions of her comparators at the time they took effect on June , , because they had not been announced internally. Instead she learned about them around  through what she described as the \"office rumour mill\". When she enquired about applying for promotion to the next stage, she was informed that there would be no more movement in the firm for the foreseeable future.Mrs Mercer flagged ious issues about her pay during  and  and the fact that promotions were taking place without any formal or transparent selection process.In June  she informed one of firms partners that she wanted to be paid the same salary as her male comparators and to have her bonus calculated on the same terms as theirs. Mrs Mercer was later told that the firm had decided to defer the issue of her salary and bonus until the end of the financial year as part of a wider review of business and salaries. Following this she lodged an internal grievance, seeking equal pay with her comparators on the ground that she was performing like work with them. Her grievance was rejected as the firm was of the view that her work as a salaried partner was \"not as demanding as that of a salaried partner benefiting from a profit share arrangement\". The legal practice accepted that Mrs Mercer was receiving less remuneration than her male colleagues but did not accept that she was undertaking like work with them.

It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so,” he said.The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Damian Collins said Sir Nick was wrong to say there was no evidence that Russia used Facebook to interfere in the referendum.“He is technically wrong on that point which he should know,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“We asked Facebook whether there was any evidence of Russians buying ads during the referendum. There was – which they shared with us – on a very small scale, but nevertheless it was there.”He added: “There has been no proper audit done during the referendum.

Durkan said that many of the  staff at Foyle House, on the Duncreggan Road, will be made redundant as it will be \"impossible\" for them to relocate to Belfast.In  HMRC announced that the Derry tax office would close in  .It came as part of a move to reconfgure its offices into thirteen regional centres serving every nation and region in the UK, with one of these centres being located in Belfast.In July  HMRC declared that its Belfast Regional Centre would be based at Erskine House, Chichester Street, Belfast, and expected to open in late . It is on schedule to open later this year.This week, Sir Jonathan Thompson, Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary of HMRC, sent a letter to Mark H. Durkan asserting that based on current plans Foyle House will close in September , with staff moving, where possible, to the Belfast Regional Centre.There are currently around  staff in Foyle House and Mr Thompson accepted that the majority live outside reasonable daily travel to Belfast.Mark H Durkan had asked that consideration be given to the integration of HMRC workers in Derry into the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, he said: “The intention of HMRC to close their offices here in September  is something I have been appealing against since it was announced in November .“I had written to Head of Civil Service, David Sterling to consider the integration of Derry staff to available DAERA positions in Ballykelly. Why this obvious solution has not been given due consideration is beyond me.“And while HMRC have acknowledged a duty of care to ex-employees, the current plan to relocate  staff members to their Belfast offices is a highly impractical approachnot virtually impossible for those with families and caring responsibilities. For many the only option they have been left with is redundancy.“It is a ludicrous and tin-eared approach to remove employment opportunities, chronically lacking in the North West, and in effect to move more of our skilled workers to Belfast.“These experienced and highly competent staff would be an asset to any organisation. The inability to provide these people some peace of mind as well as affording them opportunities to apply their skills in similar roles closer to home, has been completely overlooked.”However, in his letter Mr Thompson said, “regrettably, there are no priority arrangements for redeployment of our staff into Northern Ireland Civil Servicedepartments.“The NICS is entirely separate from the Home Civil Service and, as such, HMRC staff can only apply for roles in the NICS which may be advertised externally, including those at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in nearby Ballykelly.”Mr Thompson added that it has always been made clear that HMRC wants as many people as possible to transfer to their new location and continue their careers in Belfast.“That is why we have committed to hold one-to-one meetings between staff and managers around a year in advance of any move, to discuss inidual circumstances.“The meetings will establish who can and cannot move and what level of support will be needed to keep people working for HMRC. The one-to-ones for this office will commence in September ,” he concluded.The letter went on to say that those who decide to travel to Belfast will be given financial support in terms of travel costs and in some cases with home moves.The option of working in other government departments would also be explored.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"creggan men mixing mayweather dream las vegas boxing encounter","story":"A boxing coach and personal trainer from Creggan has spoken about an ‘amazing’ trip to Las Vegas spent in the company of many of the fight game’s legendary characters never mind his best friend who just happens to be international footballer James McClean.James McClean recently decided to celebrate turning  by inviting a few of his close friends and their partners to go on a trip to Las Vegas. So, Conor McBride and the rest of the group jumped at the chance and found themselves there last week in advance of the Tyson Fury v Tom Schwarz heavyweight bout.Conor told the Derry News: “While we were in Las Vegas, I had the idea to visit the Mayweather gym as James and myself are both big boxing fans. Mayweather’s boxing club is one of the most famous in the world. We both knew it would be a once in a letime experience so we grabbed it with both hands.”The young Creggan man continued: “I used to box in my younger years so that’s where my love of the sport began.”In fact, sport and general fitness is a huge part of his everyday le.  Conor is a personal trainer by profession working at Puregym on the Strand Road and a fully qualied British Boxing Board of Control coach who holds a BScin Sport’s and Exercise Physiology from the University of Central Lancashire.The Derry News asked him what it was like to rub shoulders with some of the biggest names in boxing at its most glamorous location in Las Vegas googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHe said: “The experience was amazing-listening and watching Floyd Mayweather Snr at work was incredible.“He talked about the ‘shoulder roll’ which his son Floyd Mayweather Jr, arguably one of the best boxers of all time, is famous for.“We also met Jacob ‘Stitch’ Duran, one of the world’s leading ‘cutmen’ and had a good chat with him as well.“On top of that we went to the Tyson Fury and Tom Schwarz fight which was an amazing experience and met some of the other boxers on the bill.

So, my coach and GB coaches suggested I give it a go this year. My shoot was what won the event.ldquoI was neck and neck with the previous British champion most of the way round.

Suzie has an extremely busy summer ahead of her and is so looking forward to the challenges ahead.ldquoMy focus now is Traithle Europeans in June in Madeira, then Worlds in Florida in October.

They have also branded claims the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the Fresnel lens.Described as a ldquoworkshop, the January meeting lasted over one hour with the official council record of the debate that ensued only amounting to a paltry two and a half lines.The Lecale Lightkeepers vehemently argued that they had a case for briefing councillors on the impact the loss of the beam would have but, surprisingly, the request was initially rejected.Instead, council officials insisted that officers from the the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority said this was to ensure that information could be shared and that local stakeholders and communities were fully consulted on any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future, before any plans are finalised.Council officials also insisted that wide ranging public consultation on the future of the lighthouse would take place.Campaigners mdash who were at a complete loss to understand why they were initially refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors over five months ago mdash have now been told they will get a chance to brief them and outline their case for the retention of the beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers have described the plan to remove the beam as ldquototally inadequate and unacceptable and are looking forward to outlining their case for its retention.They are also pleased that having heard from the Commissioners, politicians can now have face-to-face dialogue with campaigners.Campaigners have held several discussions with the Commissioners and frequently engage with the organisation as part of the bid to retain what they have described as a key facet of Lecalersquos heritage.ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to meet with councillors to demonstrate just how passionate people are about the retention of the beam, the spokeswoman declared. It is a symbol of unity in Lecale and has brought together all sides of our erse community. It must be retained.ldquoMeeting with councillors is particularly important for us. We have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue and will outline our concerns about the future of the beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The spokeswoman said that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the beam issue, it was important that they meet with local politicians.ldquoCouncillors have had the opportunity to hear from the Commissioners and it is important that they hear what we have to say as the group representing those opposed to this controversial proposal, she continued.ldquoThe beam must be retained for future generations given that it is an intrinsic part of the maritime history and heritage of the area and is a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape.The spokeswoman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is backing the campaign to retain the sweeping beam and it is it important that councillors hear directly from campaigners. The beam must be retained we simply cannot afford to lose it from this area and see it consigned to the pages of history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Curran steps down from government association position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK councillor Dermot Curran is stepping down from his role as president of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association this Friday.The group is the representative body for the provincersquos  councils and Cllr Curran will leave his position at the grouprsquos annual conference which is taking place at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel.The Ardglass man is Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving district councillor, having been elected to the former Down Council in , following the reorganisation of local government.He has served as NILGA president twice describing the accolade as both a ldquoprivilege and a challenge.While stepping down as the organisationrsquos president, Cllr Curran will remain a key member of the NILGA Executive.Cllr Curran mdash who was last month re-elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash has been a councillor for  years and while already Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving politician, some of his council colleagues believe that he is the longest serving in the British Isles.Dedicated to public service, Cllr Curran said he has ldquothoroughly enjoyed his second term at NILGArsquos helm and looks forward to continuing his work with the organisation.He also believes that local councils will continue to play increasingly important roles in their respective areas and that an opportunity exists to unlock the potential of local government as the hub of public services.Cllr Curran said that over recent years councils had changed dramatically, as had the political, financial and legal environment in which councillors operate.He said while local authorities had more responsibilities and power than before, they were also increasingly stretched in terms of finances and resources, an issue which has been compounded since the suspension of the Assembly.ldquoThe  councils are a key element of investment and public service delivery, but they control just % of the public purse.

However, I doubt many think that it is the cradle of horse racing, but it is.We do of course have a famous racecourse, which has just hosted a festival of racing as part of the DownTime Summerfest.Some of you, dear readers, may even know that there is an earlier racecourse in Downpatrick mdash at Old Course Road. So racing has been going on for centuries in our beautul corner of the world. And we have also played a vital role in the foundation of the Sport of Kings.The breed of horse associated with modern horse racing is the thoroughbred. A mere glance is enough to tell even the casual observer that the thoroughbred does not look like other horses.When compared to a pony or carthorse, the thoroughbred is leaner, taller and sleeker. In fact, these horses are perfectly designed for racing. They have big lungs, a big heart and long, slender legs that can move swtly.They also need special care when compared with native breeds. They have thin hair coats and so need to wear rugs or live in stables in bad weather. They need special food to give them energy to race. So these features tell you that the ancestor of the modern thoroughbred came from somewhere hot mdash from the desert, in fact. The ancestor of our racehorses is from Arabia.Back in the th century, horses were bred for work and war, not pleasure. Officers prized horses that were fast to get them in and out of battle and keep them alive. By this time, the medieval charger of knights mdash the destrier mdash was out of fashion. They were too slow and cumbersome, and soldiers no longer wore heavy suits of armour.So the horse evolved through selective breeding to become fleet of foot. There were no horses faster than the Arabian, which was specially bred to become bigger and faster than its wild cousin. The armies of the Ottoman Sultan developed special studs to create this new war machine.In , one of these fine stallions, known as the Byerley Turk, found himself outside the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman Sultan wanted to capture the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, an objective he failed to achieve when the Polish King John III Sobieski led the greatest cavalry charge in history to defeat the Ottoman forces.The Byerley Turk was captured and eventually brought to England, finding himself in the ownership of one Captain Byerley.His adventures were not over though. Recognising a fine animal, Captain Byerley adopted the Turk as his war horse. In  hewas called to Ireland to fight for King William and in  he fought at the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed, Captain Byerley later attributed his surviving that battle to the swtness of his favourite war horse.After the battle, the Turk was entered in a horse race mdash in Downpatrick. Of course, he went on to win that race and go on to be one of the most famous horses in history. The Flying Horse housing development to the east of Downpatrick is named after this famous race.The remarkable career of the Turk continued mdash and now we come to his ultimate destiny. He was put out to stud in Yorkshire. His pedigree was highly prize and he became the first of only three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred breed.Genetic testing has revealed it is his DNA that is the most common in all modern racehorses. His progeny are successful right to this day including names such as Dr Devious, Ahonoora and Indian Ridge.And it all started with a fateful race in Downpatrick over  years ago. Needless to say,Downe Vets had been around then and caring for his veterinary needs, we feel he could have achieved more..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Hurlers seeking big upset at Croke Park  ","story":"DOWN senior hurlers go into Saturdayrsquos Christy Ring Cup final at Croke Park against Meath as rank outsiders.Few pundits outside the Down camp expect anything other than a comfortable win for Meath, but say that quietly in and around Ronan Sheehanrsquos new kids on the block.The Newry man, who has close connections to several Cork hurling legends, has engendered a new-found enthusiasm and confidence in his charges.His young hurlers are a real surprise packet this season and getting to the Christy Ring Cup final is a major achievement for his fledgeling side.Sheehan has invested heavily in youth and has two schoolboys in his starting .Downpatrickrsquos Tim Prenter, who plays his club hurling for Ballygalget and Ballycranrsquos Phelilm Savage are both in their final year at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and De La Salle, Downpatrick, respectively.Both lads were in the Down Schoolsrsquo side that lted the Mageean Cup earlier in the season and both hail from famous sporting families.Prenter, who also won a MacLarnon Cup medal with the Red High a few months back, is the son of former Antrim senior football defender Kieran Prenter and his grandfather Seamus Burns was a well known member of the all-conquering Belfast Celtics basketball team that swept all before them in the s and s.Savage, whose brother Liam is also in the team, is the son of former Ballycran and Ulster midfielder Gary lsquoGazarsquo Savage, who was also a noted centre half with Ballycam Celtic in the Newcastle League.There are also several other young players in the  with Portaferryrsquos Matthew Conlon, Ronan Blair, Darragh Mallon, Tom Murray, Caolan Taggart and Eoghan and Daithi Sands all in their early s.Throw in Liatroimrsquos Oisin McManus, P J Davidson and Ruairi McCrickard and Ballycranrsquos Stephen Keith, Gerard Hughes, Huw Flynn and Liam and Phelim Savage and you have the nucleus of squad that could dominate Ulster hurling for years.In addition to Prenter, Ballygalget provide the squad with, John McManus, Danny Toner, Marc Fisher and Cathal Coulter with Newry Shamrocks providing Paul Sheehan and Jordan Murphy.Helping Ronan Sheehan from the sidelines is Cork legend Diarmuid OrsquoSullivan and the Down manager believes his support has been critical in moving the side forward.ldquoDiarmuid has been doing a bit of defensive coaching for us and he has been there for all of the Christy Ring Cup games, he said.ldquoHe would know a lot of the boys from the development squads because he wouldrsquove come and done coaching sessions down through the years. The first set of minors he was involved with were probably the likes of Conor Woods, so, itrsquos going back a bit.ldquoHaving him there with what people would probably say is a relatively inexperienced management team as well as a relatively inexperienced team on the field of play has become very important, he added.ldquoWe see this as a bit of a journey over the next two to three years and Diarmuid being there to help build along the way will make a massive dference. Sheehan also believes that OrsquoSullivan has made a big impact on the players and he canrsquot praise him highly enough.ldquoIn terms of his knowledge of the game and the wee bits of coaching he does around how to tackle, there have been huge strides, Sheehan said.ldquoTackling was definitely something we felt we needed to work on, we were giving away too many frees in the past. You can see the dference even in the way the likes of Tom Murray, only  and Darragh Mallon at , are playing like demons, he beamed.ldquoThe other thing be brings is a great calmness on match days.The lads respond well to that, when he has a quiet word with them beforehand.This will be Downrsquos fourth appearance in the Christy Ring final, but they have only lted the cup once and that was back in ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New working group to run local mountain bike trails  ","story":"A NEW working group is to be established to assist with the management of the hugely popular mountain bike trails in Castlewellan Forest Park.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is keen to meet with those who use the trails and organise local events, alongside representatives from Cycling Ireland, to discuss what have been described as a number of challenges in managing the facility and sister trails in Rostrevorrsquos Kilbroney Forest Park.Over pound.m has been invested in developing trails in both parks and together they attract over one million users each year, with pound, invested annually in their management.The success of both authorised and unauthorised trails within both parks presents challenges for Newry, Mourne and Down Council, members of its Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee were told on Monday.The local authority manages the bike trails under licence from the Forest Service and is also responsible for their maintenance.Politicians were told that in addition to the authorised trail network, an unofficial or lsquonaturalrsquo network also exists and has been in place for many years.

As anticipation builds for next month’s Open at Royal Portrush, the veteran radio and TV presenter visited the host course as well as clubs like Royal Belfast, Royal County Down and the town of St Andrews in Scotland – recognised internationally as the home of golf. Gery Kelly and Bill MontgomeryGerry starts his journey at his home club in Ardglass tracing the beginnings of golf in Ireland and reveals a few surprises as he discovers the relatively unknown Ulster-Scots golfing pioneers who helped establish the sport here.He visits stately homes including Mount Stewart on the shores of Strangford Lough and Grey Abbey House – chatting with Lady Rose Lauritzen and William Montgomery – and travels to St Andrews to explore how the Scots claim to have invented the sport and what part they played in bringing the game across the Irish Sea. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p He also sets out to finally answer the age-old dispute about which club is actually the oldest in Ireland. Gerry, who has been playing golf for over five decades at Ardglass Golf Club, said: “Before I began filming for the programme, despite playing the game for most of my le, I actually knew very little about its history, and that’s a shame because there are few sports with as long and as rich a history. Gery Kelly at St Andrews“The thing that amazed me the most was the fact that golf was played in Scotland in the s and it took over  years before it came here. With all the movement of people between the two countries, that Ulster-Scots connection, why did it take so long for the game to be finally organised here ”Gerry, who has been playing golf since he was a teenager, said: “Golf is a sport you can get easily hooked on. It’s a game for le. I know people still playing in their nineties.“For me it’s not so much now about that standard of golf now. I used to play off single figures, now I’m a teenager , it’s about the craic with your fourball. “We would get out once or twice a weekend and play for a fiver. It’s the most important three or four hours of the week to win that fiver.”Links To The Past: Pioneers Of Ulster Golf is on BBC Two Northern Ireland tomorrow night at pm.The one-hour film has been produced by NPE Media for BBC Northern Ireland, with support from the Ulster-Scots Broadcast Fund.l Morning View, page JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":"....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]]]]]]]Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Business Education Health Opinion People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Business Education Health Opinion People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Politics      lsquoSoldier Frsquo banner row takes new twist as council calls for removalThe row over a proleration of banners in support of #Soldier F# has intensied with one local council attempting to have them removed.

A spokesperson for the department said on Monday: “Given the steps already being taken by the DVA, the department is not considering the use of exemptions at this time.”The steps taken by the DVA include running an additional , vehicle inspections across Sunday, June  and Sunday, June  with plans for even more Sunday openings in the coming weeks, the recruitment of extra staff, and issuing reminder letters earlier.But DUP MLAs Gary Middleton and Carla Lockhart have urged a rethink of the decision to rule out exemptions for the forseeable future.Mr Middleton said: “I know there were a number of measures put in place – which has to be welcomed – but I don’t know how much impact that has had.“I still believe they need to, and have the power to look at exemptions because this is no fault of the drivers.”He added: “People are being left without their cars. I think the DVA need to look again because it’s been a few weeks now and the problem is still there.”Ms Lockhart said she would put that point to the DVA.She recently received a letter from the DVA’s director of operations Pat Delaney, which said: “I do not consider an exemption necessary at this time as I am hopeful that the measures outlined above will help reduce waiting times.”DUP man John Finlay: ‘I warmly welcome the banner in Ballymoney in support of Soldier F’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The Upper Bann MLA said: “I find that response very disappointing. I believe the DVA should consider some form of exemption so responsible motorists are not being unfairly penalised by a problem with the system.“I will be making further representations to the DVA on that basis.”SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan, a former Stormont minister with responsibility for MOT tests, has said the current backlog is being made worse by drivers missing appointments. “While I am disappointed that DfI have chosen not to consider a ‘period of grace’ for motorists, the current situation has been somewhat exacerbated by the hundreds of people failing to show up for appointments,” he said.try catch  TrendingExclusive: Joey Dunlops family issues plea forof highly sentimental items belonging to five-time world championN.I. railway line reopens after tragic incidentWillie Frazer critically ill family lsquodevastatedrsquo by VSSTwo people found dead in N.I. house -

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

service was set up in a way that prevents it acting like a commercial landlord ndash meaning it cannot takelegal action, issue penalty charges, stop services or evict NHS bodies.Furthermore, action against non-NHS tenants, including GPs, must be approved by the Department of Health and Social Careon a case-by-case basis.NHS Property Services is owned by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, and consists of , properties worth % of the entire NHS estate in terms of floor space.More than % of properties owned by the group are health centres, clinics and surgeries.Some % of tenants are NHS trusts and NHS foundation trusts, while % are GPs.NAO investigators found that since  , the percentage of tenants without rental agreements in place has increased from nearly two-thirds to %.Many NHS organisations and GPs also seem to regard paying for their premises as optional, with almost pound million either written off or still unpaid, the report said.In  , the service only recovered .p for every pound it billed ndash andoutstanding debt increased from pound million in March  to pound million in March .Although GPs only occupy % of the properties, they owe % of the current outstanding debt, the study found.Overall, between   and  , the service wrote off pound million in debt.The NAO has now recommended that the DHSC works with the service to ensure its tenants agree rent payments and contracts by the end of March .Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: ldquoThe service has slowly improved the way it manages its NHS properties.ldquoHowever, more than eight years after being created, it still lacks the powers it needs to run its affairs effectively, and the accuracy of bills is still disputed.Labour MP Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Commons public accounts committee, said the report made forldquouncomfortable reading.She added: ldquoNHS Property Services Limited was undermined from the start as it did not have the powers it needs to work effectively.ldquoAs a result it has written off or not collected almost pound million since .ldquoBut Property Services is not blameless, almost pound million of its bills have been disputed by its tenants.ldquoThe Department must take urgent action to fix this broken charging framework for NHS property.Dr Richard Vautrey, chairman of the British Medical Associationrsquos GP committee, said GPs leasing buildings from NHS Property Services ldquohave seen their service and maintenance fees rise astronomically with no agreement and no proper explanation.He said it was right that GPs do not pay fees that ldquocould risk the very future of their practices and the ability to provide care for patients.He added: ldquoIndeed, this timely report, which helpfully highlights that there is no legal right or power to collect these payments, comes as we announce that we have written to NHS Property Services asking it to urgently address the service fee issue or we will consider legal action.ldquoIt is simply not the case, however ndash as this report claims ndash that GPs see paying for premises as lsquooptionalrsquo.ldquoPractices want to pay a fair and appropriate rent, but this needs to be reimbursed by clinical commissioning groups.ldquoA lack of funding in recent years means commissioners cannot keep up with sky-rocketing commercial rents demanded by NHS Property Services, and theyrsquove simply passed the problem and the cost to family doctors.A Department of Health and Social care spokesman said: ldquoNHS Property Services has helped the NHS raised overpound

Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you are interested in adopting a dog please get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymenaAbandoned - SallyBikers invited to memorial for

Then I’m like a cyclone raging around the house making sure two teenage boysare showered and dressed as we all have to be out of the house by am. amI force myself to get to the gym and twice a week, I train with my personal trainer Curtis. I prefer to get my sessions out of the way at the start of the day as I just couldn’t face the gym in the evening..amI normally start my day at our offices in Holywood with a quick meeting with our head of finance and head of production. Communication is crucial in television as schedules, filming and edits change constantly. Getting updates from my team helps me get into trouble-shooting mode.amI’m on the road a lot with work so it’s normally a flight to London or a drive to Dublin to meet broadcasters or talent. I can be down to Dublin twice a week for meetings.

I try to be healthy at lunch time but often I don’t have much time so I do keep a supply of protein bars in ious bags and drawers in my desk.pmWe have three or sometimes four edit suites running concurrently and as managing director of the company I like to review all our programmes before they are sent to commissioning editors.

I am truly terrible at yoga but I find it helps to just focus on myself for that hour. pmBack home it is checking home works and begging my elder son to revise for his A-levels.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.

North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
