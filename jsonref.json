The brash young American boxer told reporters it would take only five rounds to finish off Britain’s Henry Cooper in their first contest in 1963 – as displayed in this memorable image by Gerry Cranham, shot at a training hall in Shepherd’s Bush. However, the fight didn’t exactly go to plan. In the final seconds of the fourth round, it was Clay who hit the deck, dizzied by a left hook from his bloodied opponent. He was so badly shaken, in fact, that myth has it his trainer, Angelo Dundee, surreptitiously worsened a tear in his gloves, forcing an inspection between the rounds that bought his fighter valuable extra seconds in which to recover.

By spring, a pandemic suffuses the globe. In America, businesses shut down, airports empty, misinformation abounds. The president, a isive figure with a tanning bed in the White House, offers baseless reassurances, and appoints the dubiously pious vice-president to lead the pandemic response. This would be a decent summary of the past two months, if it wasn’t the plot to The End of October, a new novel by Lawrence Wright, which flies thrillingly, eerily close to reality – a global outbreak of a deadly pathogen with no known cure in the kinetic, flammable information torrent of the late 2010s.“It’s unnerving” Wright, a New Yorker staff writer and Pulitzer-winning journalist, told the  on the surreal fortune of releasing a global pandemic novel during a global pandemic. “It was meant to be a warning cry, when we weren’t buffeted by all this dire news. Whenever I open the paper it feels like I’m reading my own book. It’s weird.” The End of October, which Lawrence began writing in 2017 (his final draft was submitted in summer 2019), is a deeply researched scenario-play of a novel – the world faced with a 1918 Spanish flu-type pathogen – told in brisk, unsparing prose. Competence and expertise serve as its compass Wright’s American protagonist, Dr Henry Parsons, is a cunning, emotionally clamped virologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), outrunning a shady past at a secret lab in Maryland’s Fort Detrick.Alarmed by a mass die-off in an Indonesian political concentration camp for young gay men, Henry travels to Jakarta, where he discovers “Kongoli virus”, named after the camp, a gruesome new form of hemorrhagic influenza. Wright’s writing is clinical and unblinking – you stare into chest cavities, at lungs subsumed in fluid, at bodies turned blue by cyanosis, or lack of oxygen. The Kongoli camp is quarantined and swarmed by various health agencies that are, like Henry, veterans of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa. But when an inadvertently exposed taxi driver makes the hajj – the Islamic holy pilgrimage to Mecca – along with 3 million other people, all bets for containing the spread are off. Within days, people die en masse around the world.The idea for a modern pandemic story originated in 2010, when film-maker Ridley Scott approached Wright to write a screenplay about the end of civilization. “In my mind, the more likely way civilization would be threatened like that would be a pandemic,” said Wright, who long admired the “really creative, intelligent” epidemiologists, microbiologists and virologists he encountered as a journalist. Though they never made the movie, “I was always interested and I thought it was a really good story,” he said. “I decided that if I was going to do it, I would have to do the research I had failed to do when I was working on it as a script.”Wright, known for incredibly thorough research in his non-fiction work, took a journalistic approach to researching the novel – reading as much as possible, contacting experts (the acknowledgments cite leading experts from the NIH, Columbia and Pfizer, among others). His sources were “the same guys who are developing a vaccine – they’re the best minds around” and helped Wright contort his way out of a medical puzzle he’d written into the novel’s second half, when pandemic-stranded Henry is trying to get home to his family in Atlanta. They also color the novel with rich and accessible scientific detail on viruses, bioweapons and past pandemics.Wright primarily based the Kongoli virus on the 1918 Spanish flu, which also arrived in the US in the spring, lulled in the summer, and returned with a deadlier second wave in the fall. The title The End of October pays tribute to arguably the most mortal month in American history, in which 195,000 people died. “The question I was asking my experts was: what would happen if something like the 1918 flu appeared in our civilization?” Wright said. “Would we be any better prepared than our ancestors? It’s not clear what the answer is.”In writing Kongoli’s geopolitical fallout – Russia escalates cyberwarfare and tensions boil over in the Gulf – Wright worked in expertise honed in his previous non-fiction books on conflict in the Middle East (Thirteen Days in September), religious fanaticism (Going Clear, an exposé on Scientology turned into a 2015 HBO documentary) and the War on Terror (The Looming Tower, on al-Qaida’s road to 911, which earned him a Pulitzer prize in 2007). “I looked at the antagonisms, the rivalries, and I just imagined if you add stress – a pandemic – then what would happen?” he said. “It’s pretty dismaying to watch the blame game going on right now and seeing that governments are behaving pretty much as expected.”Though (as of now) much more apocalyptic than the present, Wright’s book anticipates several elements of the Covid pandemic: hate crimes against the minority group blamed for the virus (in the novel’s case, Muslims). Ventilator shortages. Empty, flailing attempts at reassurance from the administration. But he, like many public health experts, did not anticipate a breakdown in testing. “I was horrified,” said Wright of the testing debacle. “And saddened, because the CDC in my experience had always been one of the glittering prizes of American government, something you could always rely upon – their expertise, their competence, their authority. And to see them stumble so badly, it’s heartbreaking.”He also didn’t anticipate one hopeful development of this pandemic: “the solidarity of inidual citizens to isolate themselves at enormous personal costs, social costs, spiritual costs, financial costs”.There’s a compulsive thrill to reading a book which grazes, and then runs off with, our increasingly ungraspable reality, but Wright is careful not to tout his writing as prescient. “I made some lucky guesses, but for the most part, what people are reading as prophecy is just what experts told me would happen,” he said. Expertise, briefing books, scenario exercises – “all of that stuff was on the table. It was there for anybody who was interested, and I was interested.”As for how he imagines a new normal, “I think we’re at a crossroads,” he said. “War or depression or pandemic gives you a kind of X-ray vision about the society you live in, and you see it for what it is – its shortcomings, its strengths. And I think the shortcomings are plainly apparent: the partisanship, the needless international antagonisms, the lack of preparation, the disrespect for science, all of those things are creating havoc that we shouldn’t have to deal with.”And while Wright understands people might have pandemic reading fatigue – “There are going to be a lot of people who aren’t emotionally ready to read this book,” he conceded – he hopes people leave the End of October with a “clearer understanding of disease and contagion and the dangers of pandemics, and also be impressed, as I am, by the courage and ingenuity of the people who are fighting disease. That’s why the book is dedicated to them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb9a327fbb78f38a74f6340ce8f7fa2fb3f45aeb/0_233_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c945e0b6ad31e95173a3f160ef542a29","title":"ocado sales rise covid 19 online shopping surge","story":"Ocado’s remuneration committee said it did not believe there was a basis to change the scheme as it reflected “the outstanding returns received by shareholders” which had arisen because of the “extraordinary underlying growth and performance of the business”.Andrew Harrison, the chair of the committee, said that substantial increases in fixed pay were justified because directors’ roles had “materially changed” because of its growing roster of international clients who have bought Ocado’s technology.Duncan Tatton-Brown, the chief financial officer, said there was uncertainty over whether shoppers would remain keen on home deliveries once the lockdown was eased.Tatton-Brown said the executives were being rewarded for “exceptional performance” under the bonus scheme, which was approved in 2014.Since its launch shareholders have seen the value of the company increase by £7.5bn to nearly £12bn. “It is what it is. And I don’t think there is more to say,” he said.Ocado was not banking a windfall from the surge in online grocery sales, he said, and had not benefited from government assistance such as business rates relief or the delay of VAT payments. The company has not furloughed staff under the government job protection scheme.“We’ve really done our bit and tried to scale up. If we could have scaled faster we would have done. We will keep trying to do more,” Tatton-Brown said.He claimed Ocado was “outperforming” other supermarkets in offering help to shoppers shielding at home with deliveries to 150,000 vulnerable families, he said.Tatton-Brown said Ocado had hired engineering contractors to speed up work on its warehouses to help meet demand, including two new sites and the rebuilding of one in Andover, which burned down last year. “We are seeing a lot of extra costs,” he said.Despite delays caused by the need for safeguarding for construction workers during the pandemic, he said the facilities would be completed on time next year. Ocado expected to begin delivering groceries for its new partner, Marks \u0026amp Spencer, in the autumn as planned, he added.He said customers were putting more in their online baskets on each visit. While the amount spent has fallen from the peak in mid-March when families were preparing for lockdown, shoppers are still spending more than usual because they are not dining out and buying sandwiches for lunch.He said the mix of goods ordered had changed, with the emphasis on pasta, tins and toilet roll in the early days of the pandemic having switched to include more chocolate, wine and other discretionary products."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ccccfc692e0ede07383935bbaa2ef0ee7c4c4b9/0_286_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=a3add213fe0a4675eaec3a3b5d2824c5","title":"the guardian view on labour and coronavirus lay claim to the future","story":"Keir Starmer must prepare now for the moment when voters begin to wonder what he stands for besides constructive opposition to the ToriesLeader of the opposition has always been one of the toughest jobs in politics and Keir Starmer has come to it in exceptionally tricky circumstances. His party has been out of government for a decade. Labour is united in wanting to set factional differences aside but without agreement on how to do it.Meanwhile, Boris Johnson is enjoying a prolonged honeymoon in opinion polls. Partly that reflects natural gravitation of support to incumbents in a national crisis. Mr Johnson’s critics might complain that his credentials as a reliable leader are unearned, but the complaint itself is unlikely to change voters’ minds.Sir Keir’s challenge is to assert the truth about government failings without appearing to undermine its pandemic response with excessive partisanship. That is the balance he struck in his first interrogation of Mr Johnson in parliament on Wednesday. The questions were well calibrated to dismantle Downing Street’s claim that the UK’s handling of the coronavirus has been a success. It has not, as the grim death toll – the highest in Europe – seems to indicate. Sir Keir’s background as a barrister equips him well to build a case and present it in a way that discomforts the other side. Mr Johnson’s typically blustering responses sounded doubly vacuous in a Commons hushed by the requirements of physical distancing.It is not surprising that the prime minister prefers to make announcements by televised address, and the Labour leader is right to demand that future policy changes be presented to parliament first. Mr Johnson is in the habit of evading such scrutiny and is unlikely to relish routine questioning from a rigorous adversary. But competence across the despatch box is only a small part of the project to persuade voters that the leader of the opposition is a potential prime minister. Most of that task is behind closed doors. It is the strategic mission to develop a clear argument about what is wrong with the country and a distinctive prescription for making it better.The vital ingredient is optimism. Oppositions win elections when people gamble on change. It is not sufficient to convince voters that the incumbent has flaws. By extension, sitting governments cannot expect public gratitude for their achievements when oppositions have a more compelling account of what should come next. The Tory party is haunted by its defeat in 1945, when national rejoicing at victory in the second world war failed to translate into votes for Winston Churchill.Military analogies are overused in the current crisis, but that postwar poll is not an unrealistic model for Labour. The job of reconstruction required after the pandemic will be as vast. That task should have a clear ethical blueprint, incorporating longer-standing social and economic challenges, just as the establishment of the NHS in the 1940s spoke to legacy demands of the pre-war years. Labour has an opportunity to develop the equivalent vision for the 2020s, for example, by combining changes demanded by the climate emergency with reforms to achieve a more equitable distribution of wealth and opportunity.That is a heavy intellectual burden when the party also has an electoral mountain to climb, but the summit will not be reached with smaller-scale ambition. A trap for Sir Keir is to think he can advance by tactical increments, probing weaknesses in Mr Johnson’s position, chipping away at the Tories’ lead. Politics affords few second chances and the Labour leader’s audition with the electorate has begun already. There are many more questions than answers about his priorities, and his vision. It is still very early in the electoral cycle. No one expects to see a fully-formed government-in-waiting yet. But there will come a time when voters demand to know what the opposition stands for, besides criticising the Tories. If Labour is to build something worth showing at that moment, the foundations need laying now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91ccb6f0e2a9827c88a88efb754f37b9dbf7863a/0_89_878_527/master/878.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97ce2d67695e493e18baff188665213f","title":"why normal people has the makings of a fashion classic","story":"If Sally Rooney is the first great millennial novelist, then Marianne Sheridan is the first great millennial TV style iconWould it make a person really shallow if their favourite thing about the TV adaptation of Normal People was Marianne’s wardrobe? Asking for a friend.Rumbled. I am obsessed with everything Daisy Edgar-Jones wears on screen for the whole, blissful 12 episodes. The spaghetti strap sundress she wears for an afternoon bike ride and an ice-cream in an Italian piazza is surely the most delicious ballerina-length black dress since the bare-shouldered satin cocktail dress with the bateau-neckline and the bow-tied shoulders Hubert de Givenchy made for Audrey Hepburn in the film Sabrina in 1954. (A dress so iconic that it is known as the “Sabrina dress”. )Then there is the short A-line tunic in sun-faded gingham Marianne wears by the pool in another scene from that Trieste holiday. With her lush fringe and coltish beauty, the vibe is pure Jane Birkin circa 1969. And the yellow sleeveless blouse in which she bolts in late to the school exam hall, when everyone else is in uniform. And don’t get my started on the cream V-neck blouse with the black silk scarf and the dangling shell earrings.Normal People is not about clothes. Indeed, lots of the very best bits of Normal People are the scenes where Marianne and Connell have no clothes on at all. But I think we all know by now that Marianne’s sweaty sex hair and Connell’s chain are iconic, so I will spare you more thigh-rubbing.Maybe it is a marker of how good Normal People is that it not about clothes and yet the clothes are still brilliant. Or maybe it’s because Normal People is not about clothes that the clothes are brilliant. When television makes noise in fashion it is usually for cutting-edge, scene-stealing looks by of-the-moment designers: Villanelle wearing The Vampire’s Wife in the new season of Killing Eve, say. But this show’s Emmy-nominated costume designer, Lorna Marie Mugan, whose previous credits include the stylish and very influential Peaky Blinders, dressed Marianne in a mix of high street and vintage, with a few pieces from Mugan’s own wardrobe.The clue to the magic of Normal People is in the name not the normal part, the people part. Sally Rooney’s fine-grained characterisation of Marianne is all there on the small screen. It’s in her summer-holiday plimsolls and her washed-out underwear, the protective jumpers she wears to the library and her flimsy, over-exposing party dresses.If Rooney is the first great millennial novelist, Marianne is the first great millennial TV style icon. The show captures the way young women look now. The one-piece swimming costume instead of the bikini, the bedroom loungewear that s essay-writing and sleeping. The high-waisted jeans, and the short party dresses. Even Marianne’s slenderness – often mentioned in the book – is accentuated in the modern way, in the looseness of a pair of jeans or the leotard fit of a vest, rather than the old-fashioned methods of darted tailoring, or waist-cinching belts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13578cc4bf36203a48fa3a397ef975a3c402c43d/626_0_2859_1716/master/2859.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e8f48ba487d5a528425e3e291fd8239","title":"the wretched review horror movie","story":"An ancient witch preys on the women of a seaside resort in a laborious tale that pinches from Spielberg and Stephen KingThe title has been applied blankly and pretty arbitrarily to a by-the-numbers, unscary movie from US indie film-makers, the Pierce brothers, Drew and Brett. It was originally called Hag, which would have been better.Ben (Jean-Paul Howard) is a troubled teenager who one summer goes to stay with his orced dad, Liam (Jamison Jones), at a coastal resort he’s been fixed up with a job at the marina that Liam manages. Ben starts to have feelings for smart, pretty Mallory (Piper Curda), who works there, but he also becomes obsessed with the weird family who live next door to his dad, especially the mom, Abbie (Zarah Mahler), who is behaving very strangely. The laborious “35 years previously” flashback that begins the movie hints darkly at horrible events that once took place in this house. (Some odd period-signalling shows an Etch-a-Sketch and Rubik’s cube left out in the rain.) Could it be that an ancient witch, who lives under a tree in the nearby woodland, is making predatory and parasitic attacks on local women? This film has pinched ideas from Hitchcock, Spielberg, Stephen King and a number of others, but these borrowings don’t feel like film-brat homages, just generic mannerisms that the directors have absorbed from the industry atmosphere. There is a bit of Blair Witch here, and a dash of J-horror, and the film particularly displays the now baffling belief that to be really scary you have to look like a hideous demon who turns around to face the camera in a series of shuddering creaks. The narrative focus is frustratingly split between Ben’s family and Abbie’s, and the result is a non-frightening muddle.• The Wretched is available on digital platforms from 8 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61ae7c2bfc22122bde3f0cb7a3f42b8b0fad989f/721_965_8091_4855/master/8091.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=704facfad54c893dbbbcf290c2ce8d71","title":"how to cook borscht recipe felicity cloake masterclass","story":"The east European favourite is a great soup to have in your repertoireDespite being best known by its Russian name, borscht, this richly flavoured beetroot soup is beloved throughout eastern Europe, where it has as many variations as names some beefy, some vegetarian (especially for the Lenten fast), some thick with bread or soured cream. One thing they all have in common, however, is a glorious pink colour just the thing to cheer you up in these uncertain times.300g beetroot (see step 1)1 small onion1 small carrot1 stick celery1 small leek50g butter2 whole allspice berries½ bay leaf1.5 litres gelatinous beef stock (see step 4), or chicken or vegetable stock2 medium potatoes, preferably waxy (eg, charlotte or maris peer)½ small cabbage, shredded4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 tbsp cider vinegar1 tsp sugar½ tsp ground black pepperSalt|Soured cream and fresh dill, to serve (preferably Polish soured cream, which has a richer flavour)Borscht is best made with raw beetroot, but if you have only the ready-cooked sort, you can use that instead, though it doesn’t give the finished soup such a vibrant hue or intense flavour. Whichever you use, you’ll need either gloves, or a stout nailbrush, and an apron, because beetroot stains everything it touches.Peel the onion and carrot, and wash the celery and leek thoroughly. Thinly slice the onion. If using raw beetroot, peel it and cut roughly three-quarters of it into small dice, setting the remainder aside for now if using cooked, dice and set aside for now. Cut the carrot and celery into smallish dice and thinly slice the leek.Melt the butter in a large pan over a medium-low heat, then fry the onion until fairly soft and translucent. Add the carrot, leek, celery, raw diced beetroot (if using), allspice berries and bay leaf, and stir to coat in the melted butter. Cook for 10 minutes, adding a little stock if the vegetables begin to look dry.On the subject of stock, borscht is most commonly made with beef stock, preferably the good, gelatinous sort, which will give the soup real richness and body. However, if you don’t eat beef, chicken or vegetable stocks will also be delicious if using the latter, I’d recommend soaking some dried mushrooms in it first to give it more flavour.Meanwhile, wash and peel the potatoes and cut them into small dice. Add them and all the stock to the pan, bring the whole lot to a merry simmer, then turn the heat down to medium low and leave the soup to bubble away gently for 15 minutes while you prepare the other ingredients.Wash and finely shred the cabbage (you can use any sort you like, or indeed kale or similar I like to use a white cabbage for its satisfyingly robust texture), peel and crush the garlic, and coarsely grate the remaining raw beetroot, if using. Stir all these vegetables into the pan and cook until everything is tender, particularly the potatoes, which should take about another 10 minutes.Once the vegetables are done, add the diced cooked beetroot, if you’ve gone down that route, just to warm through, then taste and season with the vinegar (cider is preferable, but just about anything will do, or you could use lemon juice if you prefer), sugar, pepper and a good pinch of salt, and taste again: if you think it needs any more of the above, add them gradually until you’re happy with the flavour. And if you prefer a smoother soup, blend it at this stage, too.Divide the soup between bowls and serve with a dollop of soured cream and a sprig of dill, with some dark bread on the side for dunking. Note that, if the weather permits, you can also serve borscht cold it’s nicer well chilled than just left to cool. Sometimes the soured cream (or thick yoghurt) is stirred in rather than served on top.To make this into a more substantial meal, you can add more substantial garnishes such as chopped hard-boiled eggs, spring onions, radishes, cucumber, all of which work particularly well with cold borscht for hot versions, go for hunks of sausage, cured pork or shredded meat such as chicken or slow-cooked beef. Vegetarians may be interested to know that cooked white or broad beans are fairly common additions, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4c17a32a46691206373d4f04ad94b1327d64b5b/11_267_3861_2318/master/3861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e396b49e2b6a4988796bb00ecfdb5586","title":"one box eggs 17 delicious ways to use them french toast huevos rancheros","story":"If you’re tired of boiling or frying, there are plenty of other brilliant ways to use one of the world’s most versatile, affordable, tasty ingredientsIt is a time of scarcity, but also of glut a time when you might buy 18 eggs at the supermarket, just because the last time you tried, they didn’t have any. This could present an opportunity for creativity, but 18 eggs is enough to induce a failure of imagination in anyone: you boil them, fry them, poach them – then what?Here are 17 delicious and slightly further-afield recipes to use up your eggs, most of them employing simple ingredients you may already have.I get way too much credit for making my own mayonnaise – it just isn’t very hard. Everyone should make their own mayonnaise. All that’s required is some egg yolks, oil, salt, mustard, vinegar or lemon juice and about 10 minutes of your time. If you’ve never done it before, Felicity Cloake’s perfect mayo is the place to start.Use a heavy bowl placed on a tea towel – when you’re whisking with one hand while pouring oil with the other, you don’t want the bowl skidding around the worktop. The trick is to start slowly – add only a few drops of oil at time and gradually increase. I find mayo pretty forgiving – an accidental slosh of oil at the start can usually be accommodated – although I must admit that one out of every 20 times I do it, things go completely wrong for reasons I can’t fathom. I still think that’s an acceptable failure rate for almost anything except routine surgery.Call it what you want, but as an American, I find it hard to say the words “eggy bread” without pulling a face. Having said that, the recipe is more or less the same. Beat some eggs with milk, dip in slices of slightly stale bread (almost any kind will do, from crappy supermarket white to brioche), fry on both sides in butter until light browned and … voilà is possibly not the right word to use here. Everything appealing about french toast lies in the presentation. Americans heap on sweet things – maple syrup, fresh fruit, jam, icing sugar – so the result is halfway between breakfast and dessert. Liam Charles opts for an additional coconut coating. Thomasina Miers offers a version with salted caramel pumpkin puree (and tequila).This is more an artefact than a meal, a forgotten fossil of the American diner experience. The monte cristo is basically a ham and cheese sandwich (the cheese is usually swiss – emmental, say) that has been dipped, in its entirety, in some beaten egg and then fried as a solid mass. The result is, shall we say, pretty dense – french toast gone insane. Perversely, a monte cristo is also sometimes dusted with icing sugar. It’s the sort of no-nonsense, down-home cooking that killed Elvis. A recipe is probably unnecessary, but I include one here just so you know I’m not making this up.Eggs feature in lots of different soups, but few are as pleasingly rudimentary as Chinese egg drop soup. Most versions, like this one from the Omnivores cookbook, promise an overall preparation time of under 15 minutes. It’s just chicken stock, thickened with a little cornstarch and flavoured with ginger, sesame oil and spring onions, into which beaten eggs are dropped so they form ribbons. Honestly, I’m making it sound harder than it is. Rachel Roddy’s recipe for the Italian equivalent, stracciatella alla romana is just as basic, employing semolina, parsley and lemon zest instead.This Spanish breakfast – a sort of ratatouille with eggs – is one of a number of regional variations on a simple premise: Yotam Ottolenghi’s North African shakshuka uses a mix of red and yellow peppers Turkish menemen is much the same Diane Kochilas’s Greek version contains fennel and feta and Barrafina’s take uses duck eggs, if perchance you’re hoarding those.I tend to make this when using up odds and ends, so I work with what I’ve got (a wrinkly pepper, an aubergine and half a bag of spinach, say). Sweat some onions in a frying pan or casserole with cumin, a bit of garlic, chilli and paprika. Add the other veg and when everything is softened, chuck in a tin of tomatoes. Simmer until a dent pressed into the mush with a ladle holds its shape long enough for you to crack an egg into it, then do that three more times. Cover and cook until the eggs are how you like them. Serve with good bread.As James Hart, from the restaurant chain El Pastor, says, this really is just three ingredients: salsa, tortillas and fried eggs. It’s perfect for those mornings when a beer with breakfast seems advisable, although Hart’s salsa of peppers, onions and chipotle might require either a clear head or a certain amount of foresight. Seb Emina’s version is simpler and bears a passing resemblance to the pisto to which it is no doubt distantly related.This is a bit of a restaurant breakfast – when you type it into Google, the first thing that comes up is not “eggs benedict recipe” but “eggs benedict near me”. It was invented, allegedly, at the Waldorf in New York, in response to the demands of the hungover socialite for whom it is named.What generally stops people making eggs benedict at home is the hollandaise sauce, which is fiddly and prone to splitting and curdling. But without it, we’re just talking about poached eggs on toasted muffins. If you’ve got an excess of eggs and the time to practice, now might be your moment to conquer hollandaise. Felicity Cloake’s optimised recipe will give you a decent chance of getting right it first time, and once you’ve mastered it you can deploy it as a luxurious accompaniment to asparagus, which is very big right now.They have a certain symmetry: the separated eggs come back together when the meringue is folded in, so you don’t have to figure out what to do with a big bowl of leftover egg whites. Rowley Leigh’s gruyere and parmesan soufflés are made from simple ingredients – flour, butter, double cream, cloves, lemon juice, nutmeg, salt and pepper – and he even allows cheddar as a stand-in if you haven’t got both cheeses. If you’re after something sweeter, you might try a chocolate version.When this lemon tart appeared in the first River Cafe cookbook, it fascinated the amateur: it looked easy, if highly improbable. There is still something highly daunting about a recipe requiring six whole eggs and nine additional yolks. And you don’t roll the sweet pastry you grate it directly into the tart tin, press it down and blind bake it. For the filling, you whisk the eggs with the juice and zest of seven lemons and 350g of sugar over a very low heat, adding 300g of unsalted butter in two instalments – half at the start, half as the mixture thickens. After that, the assembled tart needs 5-8 minutes in a hot oven to colour the top. You can watch a very old video of Ruth Rogers of the River Cafe demonstrating the recipe for Martha Stewart here. Rogers might look as if she’s trying to signal that she’s being held hostage, but it’s still a handy guide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0f20b6bc0ba3928d75e71ba7ae7f36aec425f63/0_203_4221_2533/master/4221.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b30c5614ef4dbf7dc982cf9ee5704b1","title":"the hurdles premier league football must clear to restart","story":"Many questions need answers, not least where games will be played and a not-insignificant 100 concerns of club doctors Without government endorsement of a return to play, nothing can happen. Since the beginning of March, when games were still being played in front of paying crowds, the Premier League has said it would follow government advice on the best way to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.Now everyone in the game is waiting to hear what proposals Boris Johnson will make in a televised address on Sunday regarding lifting lockdown restrictions, and – so goes the hope – the work done by government to underpin them.The Premier League has been lobbying government to be allowed to return. The government wants football back “as soon as possible”, according to the culture secretary, so that, in the words of the foreign secretary, it can “lift the spirits of the nation”.There remains, however, significant uncertainty as to the details of any government measures and the time frame in which they will be implemented. There must be some concern that the Premier League finds itself in a halfway house this weekend not prevented from restarting but not guided as to how it should go about it.If the government gives football the thumbs-up, attention turns to the key parts of any attempts to complete the season: two protocols, one for a safe return to training, the other to enable matches.Under current ambitions there is hope for a return to training on 18 May and matches roughly three weeks later on 8 June, before a seven-week blitz that would allow the season to be completed by the end of July.A lot of work has been done on both protocols, but neither is complete. Government advice is partly the cause but there are other unresolved issues. The protocols must be approved by 14 of the league’s 20 clubs in a vote if they are to be taken up. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200504-59256-gnl.fw.200504.jf.France33Germanyb.mp3 As part of the work of developing the protocols, club doctors were asked to analyse proposed measures and come back with questions. On Monday the Premier League Doctors Group presented league officials with 100 of them.This huge response is believed to have come from a small number of doctors, maybe as few as four. Some of the questions relate to associated issues such as liability in the event of an insurance claim or particular characteristics of the Covid-19 virus. But the sheer number sends out a signal: there is significant work to be done.One of the phrases being used in Premier League circles is that a return to training will be “safer than a trip to a supermarket”. But that may not be setting the bar sufficiently high. A number of the doctors’ concerns related to the effects of physical contact, an entirely necessary part not only of matches but also training. You can’t have football with physical distancing, but can you keep the virus at bay without it?Central to the success of a return is Covid-19 testing for players, staff and anyone required to help the staging of games. Estimates of the number of tests required start at 40,000 but could go much higher. The Premier League has acquired testing facilities and is confident of being able to privately secure the tests required (with a cost of upwards of £4m). This can be done without impact on NHS and public health needs, it insists. Whether that perception will get through to the public, and not be seen as inappropriate even if it does, remains to be seen.On the protocol that will determine a return to play, the use of neutral grounds has become the key sticking point. Games cannot be played in front of crowds but league officials are believed to have presented the use of neutral grounds too as a fait accompli during a shareholders’ meeting last week. They are necessary, they argue, to gain the support of the police – who expressed concerns about crowds gathering outside venues – and also to guarantee safety, with some stadiums deemed impractical to achieve physical distancing.While much of the debate around Project Restart has been done in private, some club executives have spoken out on the issue of neutral grounds. Brighton’s chief executive, Paul Barber, said they had “the potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition” and on Wednesday his Aston Villa counterpart, Christian Purslow, expressed similar views. Both clubs are threatened with relegation and some feel neutral venues are being used as an excuse to call for the season to be curtailed. But there is no doubt that the absence of crowds and home advantage will materially change the competition.If the government says yes and the protocols are completed and the clubs vote for them, then all that’s left is to persuade the people who will actually complete the season: the players. Eighty stand to be out of contract at the end of June, setting up another potential pinch point (again, still to be resolved). But more importantly, there is the issue of persuading men who often have young families to take a leap of faith that they will be able to compete safely. Not many have chosen to air their feelings on the subject but those who have have been afraid. With things as they stand, who can blame them?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41066c5b5024b1e56b14313a8076782f29ff0665/69_182_5233_3140/master/5233.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a391dc66dbee03d96640038dc1841b28","title":"bundesliga football puts its reputation on the line with return in late may","story":"The league plans to return this month, but Hertha’s Salomon Kalou and 10 positive Covid tests have weakened its caseIt was expected, and now it’s here. The Bundesliga will be the first of Europe’s major leagues to restart in the second half of May, with the federal government sign-off on Wednesday giving the league freedom to decide on the timetable itself. It had been signposted by the health minister, Jens Spahn, giving verbal approval to the DFL’s detailed safety and hygiene plan this week.The devil, however, is in the detail. Spahn ended by saying that designing a plan and living it out were two different things, and that is exactly what the Bundesliga and its clubs are finding out. On Monday the DFL reported there had been 10 positive tests among 1,724 carried out, which gave credence to its claim that the screening purpose was working, “providing additional security and thus protecting the players”.The Facebook Live video published on Monday by the Hertha forward Salomon Kalou was a case in point, flying in like a huge splodge of mud and landing flush on the front of the Bundesliga’s freshly laundered suit. It began innocuously enough, with the Ivorian striker filming his stroll into the club’s Schenkendorffplatz training facility, before he entered the dressing room. There, he shook hands with the striker Vedad Ibisevic and fitness trainer Henrik Kuchno, before wandering into what appeared to be a Covid-19 test being conducted on the defender Jordan Torunarigha.It’s hardly a first for Hertha, a club “which has already gained plenty of experience in PR disasters this season”, as 11 Freunde’s Max Dinkelaker put it. Yet as a club they have largely got away unscathed from this, throwing Kalou under the bus by suspending him indefinitely and letting him take the rap alone. He is ageing, highly paid and on his way out of the club, with weeks left on his contract. Having played only 146 Bundesliga minutes this season, he is highly unlikely to be retained.Despite fading from the first-team picture Kalou has always been considered – by club and media – a model pro, so this is a shock on more than one level. Clearly Hertha as an institution have every right to expect better of one of their senior players, who has seen and done enough at 34 to have little excuse, as the general manager, Michael Preetz, pointed out in his statement admonishing him. Preetz was keen to emphasise that everyone at the club has been reminded of the protocols but painting Kalou as the only protagonist here is flawed.The only person to challenge Kalou in the video is the physio David de Mel, testing Torunarigha, who tells him to “please erase that”. Not “stop doing that”, but “stop potentially showing others that it’s being done”. Kalou’s fellow elder statesman, the 35-year-old Ibisevic, hardly came out of the video in a blaze of glory either.“Are they fucking with us?” the captain asks in English – and that much of the dressing-room chat is in English has given the video exactly the sort of wider audience which Hertha and the Bundesliga could have done without – as he and Kalou compare pay slips. Hertha have clarified that the players’ complaints were over an “accounting error” rather than any objection to hiatus-related pay cuts, but it’s not a good look.Kalou has apologised to his teammates, though a projected role as a Hertha ambassador in Africa looks to be on shaky ground. That he should not carry the can alone seems to be the view of the authorities in Berlin, with the senator Martin Pallgen telling Kicker that Hertha can expect unannounced inspections to make sure the club and its employees are complying with regulations.With the general public – and certainly fans – ided on whether football in Germany should be pressing ahead, the implications of the scene at Hertha will linger for a greater time than the actions. If this is how one dressing room behaves, what about the other 17, or 35 if we’re counting the top two tiers? The first positive tests that came to light at the weekend, at Köln, had already created doubt in some minds, though the local health authority – which has jurisdiction in these cases, as in Berlin – had decided it was all right to carry on after the three identified with the virus were placed in quarantine.The midfielder Birger Verstraete had told VTM back home in Belgium that he thought it was “bizarre” that the whole squad hadn’t been quarantined, although he backed down after the club challenged his view and insisted protocol had been followed. Verstraete’s worry was stoked by concern for his girlfriend, who has a heart condition and has now returned to Belgium for the time being. That players have lives, concerns and responsibilities beyond their careers is not easy to allow for in even the most comprehensive plan.It’s not just on the pitch and in largely empty stadiums that hygiene needs to be considered. There has been a growing push for the Konferenz – the German practice of broadcasting simultaneous Saturday-afternoon fixtures in one programme that flits between the grounds – to be made free-to-air for the rest of the campaign. Some in the game clearly feel that the public broadcasters ZDF and ARD shouldn’t be potentially “freeloading”, as the former Bayern president Uli Hoeness charmingly put it in a recent interview with Kicker, even if the basic principle is widely agreed as sound.The idea is that multiple viewers won’t crowd into front rooms of friends who are Sky customers, and though the main rights holder said in mid-March that its plan was just to present potential clients with “competitive” new offers, the Bavarian authorities (Sky is based in the Unterföhring area of Munich) are hopeful of greater accommodations to the public.It would be a very small step towards placating those still angry with what they think of as football rushing ahead, putting financial imperatives ahead of the greater good. The Bundestag vice-president, Thomas Oppermann, wrote a guest column for Kicker this week in which he called for this tricky balance to continue to be worked on. “Football is the most beautiful thing in the world,” Opperman wrote. “We have to do a lot to keep it that way.” The reputation of the Bundesliga, with significant international reach and by going first, depends on it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d40cdf5a7beb5b32d89276f3bdcb0651b9dfc1e3/0_48_1290_774/master/1290.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ce926a259239c9096c2893b4d9286865","title":"florian schneider the enigma whose codes broke open pop music","story":"The Kraftwerk co-founder remained a mystery even after death, but there is no doubting the impact he made with his group’s sublime, visionary musicFlorian Schneider’s death came shrouded in a degree of secrecy. Gossip among fans about his health was first provoked at the end of April, when his fellow former Kraftwerk member Wolfgang Flür posted a sweet photo on social media of him and Schneider together in a bar, without explanation.It had apparently been taken in 2016 – a decade and a half after Schneider and fellow founder member Ralf Hütter had served Flür with a lawsuit provoked by his autobiography I Was a Robot – and was subsequently deleted from Flür’s Facebook page. Then, a week later, another electronic musician based in Germany, the Manchester-born Mark Reeder, posted a brief eulogy one commenter claimed that Schneider had died “several days ago”.It was hard to know what was going on: Schneider had kept such a low profile after leaving Kraftwerk that rumours of his death had circulated before, only to be revealed as erroneous when he unexpectedly appeared at a Paris charity event in late 2015, wearing a jaunty jacket and matching hat apparently made from a recycled laundry bag, and premiered a song called Stop Plastic Pollution. Then finally, his death, apparently from cancer, was confirmed by the German branch of Sony Records according to one source, Schneider died a week ago and had been buried in a private ceremony.In a sense, this was the perfect departure for Florian Schneider. Few people could have claimed to have exerted as much musical influence while remaining so enigmatic. Given Kraftwerk’s pivotal impact on everything from synthpop to hip-hop to house and techno, it’s very difficult indeed to imagine what modern music would sound like had they, and specifically the five albums they released between 1974 and 1981, not existed. But what interviews Kraftwerk gave were vague on details, given to rewriting the past – they did their best to excise the first three albums they made from history, declining to re-release them despite a burgeoning market in bootlegs, and weren’t above changing their record sleeves to remove the faces of former members – and offered almost no personal information at all: Ralf Hütter was voluble on his love of cycling, and Schneider had a daughter, but whatever else they got up to when they weren’t being Kraftwerk remained a mystery.And Schneider was the most enigmatic of the lot. There is hilarious footage of a persistent Brazilian journalist attempting to coax some quotes out of him and getting nowhere (“What songs are you going to play tonight?” “All”), while on another occasion, he consented to give an interview while wearing a fake moustache, claiming he had invented “humanoid sequencers” in 1947 and purporting to not remember who Kraftwerk were. Schneider received co-writing and co-production credits on virtually every track they produced during the imperial phase that stretched from Autobahn to Computer World, but it wasn’t entirely clear what he did in the band. Initially a flute and violin player, his keyboard skills were apparently limited when pressed on Schneider’s role, Hütter talked vaguely of him as a “sound fetishist” with an interest in speech synthesis (Schneider patented a “system for synthesised singing in real time” called the Robovox in 1990), who ensured the sonic quality of their music was “up to a certain standard” and implied that his perfectionism was one reason why Kraftwerk released so few records after 1981.In fact, without Schneider, there seems every chance that Kraftwerk would never have existed in the first place. Ralf Hütter gradually emerged as the band’s spokesman and, eventually, became their solitary original member, but according to David Buckley’s exhaustively-researched book Kraftwerk: Publikation, it was Schneider who started the band in the first place – after a brief period performing with an experimental combo with the remarkable name of Pissoff – and Schneider who ensured the band continued when Hütter briefly left to finish his university studies. The wealth of his father, a celebrated architect, meant Schneider could afford the latest musical technology, which – following a debut album under the name Organisation and two Kraftwerk albums in the avant-garde style that defined early 70s German progressive rock – increasingly came to shape the band’s sound, setting them apart from their krautrock peers. Most of the classic Kraftwerk elements were in place on 1973’s Ralf und Florian: electronic rhythms that dispensed with the need for a traditional drummer, pulsing synthesisers that presage dance music, and a gradual shift away from krautrock’s penchant for improvisation towards simple, compact melodies. It also demonstrated Schneider’s importance in defining Kraftwerk’s image. On the cover, Hütter is still long-haired and vaguely hippyish Schneider’s hair is short, neatly parted in a style that recalled the 1930s, and he wears a suit and tie.By the time of Autobahn, all of Kraftwerk looked like that. Moreover, the title track honed the musical advances of its predecessor into a 22-minute piece of music that sounded utterly unlike anything in British or American rock and pop, despite its wry lyrical nod to the Beach Boys’ Fun Fun Fun (Kraftwerk would later begin 1977’s Showroom Dummies with a clipped “eins, zwei, drei, vier” in homage to the Ramones). It was so futuristic the band made their British TV debut not on Top of the Pops, but on Tomorrow’s World, the most memorable moment of their appearance coming when Schneider unexpectedly broke ranks with their wilfully stiff, automaton-like performance and stared directly at the camera with an oleaginous smile that looked both ridiculous and faintly chilling. An extremely dry sense of humour was to prove another Kraftwerk trademark.Plenty of British synth musicians have suggested Kraftwerk’s arrival on British TV represented a life-changing eureka moment, but not everyone was enamoured with music so uncoupled from prevalent trends. Their 1975 UK tour was sparsely attended and attracted hostile reviews (“spineless, emotionless … keep the robots out of music,” blustered Melody Maker) the accompanying album, the gorgeously atmospheric Radio-Activity, flopped almost everywhere but France.1977’s Trans-Europe Express, however, proved another breakthrough: for all Kraftwerk’s rejection of standard Anglo-American rock and pop tropes, there was something weirdly danceable about the machine rhythm that underpinned the title track. If you want evidence of how ahead of their time they were, it took another five years for Trans-Europe Express to be repurposed as the Soul Sonic Force’s groundbreaking hip-hop single Planet Rock. A year after that, Detroit techno pioneer Juan Atkins used a sample of The Hall of Mirrors as the basis for Cybotron’s Clear. In 2014, with the full extent of Kraftwerk’s influence apparent, the LA Times called it “the most important pop album of the last 40 years”.Kraftwerk made two more astonishing albums. 1978’s The Man-Machine was home to both The Model – a UK No 1 four years later, by which time British pop had begun to catch up with Kraftwerk’s innovations – and The Robots, which became the band’s unofficial theme tune. 1981’s Computer World might be their creative pinnacle, an incredible collection of songs underpinned by rhythms that demonstrated that the least funky-looking band on the planet had an innate, if idiosyncratic, understanding of the dancefloor. Remarkably, for an album made at the cutting-edge of technology, it hasn’t dated at all nearly 40 years on, evidence of the fact that rock and pop now exists in a world that Kraftwerk did a huge amount to invent, where music is made by computer as a matter of course and where no one believes that the use of synthesisers denotes a lack of emotion or impact. Hanging over everything from Coldplay to dubstep, Daft Punk to Jay-Z, they may well be the single most influential band since the Beatles.Kraftwerk’s actual production of music slowed to a crawl as the 80s progressed – 1986’s disappointing Electric Café, a remix collection in 1990, Tour de France Soundtracks in 2003, nothing new since – although in recent years they’ve toured relentlessly, the world’s most futuristic heritage act, playing the classics with 3D visuals at festivals and in art galleries. At some point, Schneider left, although, characteristically, when or why isn’t clear. It was announced in 2009, but in an interview later that year, Ralf Hütter claimed he was “not really involved in Kraftwerk for many, many years”. As with almost everything else about Florian Schneider, it remains a mystery virtually the only thing you can say for certain is that the music he helped create changed pop forever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37af840e0fa81a65968f179bcca46b37c9d12087/0_198_3617_2170/master/3617.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d53045741927331b766c38c2654d3cff","title":"valley opera subbuteo stadiums and 6666 cartwheels","story":"A tenor who can be heard for miles miniature advertising and a tumbling fundraiserAs the coronavirus lockdown rolls into its seventh week, some people are still finding ways to keep their spirits up.An opera singer’s weekly performance to cheer up his village is so loud it can be heard three miles away.Tenor John Hudson lives in Piddle Valley, in Dorset, and its natural acoustics help carry his booming voice across the countryside.Hudson, 58, who would be on a tour of Sweden now but for the lockdown, has taken to singing on his doorstep every Thursday at 6pm before the “clap for carers”.“We thought it would be great if I went out in the front yard as we have this fantastic acoustic over the valley. It’s like an echoing, you can hear things for miles away,” he said.“We went out for a walk a couple of days ago and a guy who lives three miles away asked me: ‘Are you the singer?’ He said he sits in his garden and listens to me.”Hudson has sung for the English, Welsh and Scottish national operas.Neighbour Vicky Steven said: “John has got one of the most joyous voices I have ever heard in my life.

Carrie Symonds had merely looked confused. In desperation, Boris had next tried to ring Dominic Raab, but the phone went straight to voicemail. The foreign secretary wasn’t that stupid: there was no way he was going to risk a hat-trick of humiliations. Dominic Cummings had then gently taken the prime minister by the arm and led him to the Downing Street front door. It was time. The point of no return.So it was a decidedly reluctant and somewhat sheepish Boris that appeared for his first prime minister’s questions up against Keir Starmer in the Commons. He had the air of a naughty schoolboy about to appear in front of the headteacher for repeatedly failing to hand in his homework and expecting a prolonged detention as punishment. If only Boris had managed to get off that lightly. By the end he had only made the situation worse by making countless promises he had no idea he would be able to keep and which would be certain to be added to later charge sheets.For all his life Boris has managed to blag his way out of any tricky situation. Half Flashman, half Billy Bunter, lies and half-truths have been his stock in trade. But in Starmer it is as if he has instinctively realised he has met his match. A power greater than himself. There was little of the prime minister’s familiar smirks, bluster and banter. Weirdly, he didn’t even really make much effort to put up a fight. Just a series of mumbled excuses that he didn’t expect to be believed.Not that it’s any great shock Starmer has turned out to be so good at PMQs. First off, he’s an inherently serious man and these are serious times. He’s also had years of practice in cross-examination as a QC, so he’s learned how to fine tune his approach. He asks the right questions in the right manner. Never raising his voice, the stiletto in his hand is his courtesy. A death by a thousand kindnesses. What was more surprising was just how easy it all was for him. Keir will have had a harder morning’s work defending a shoplifter at Snaresbrook crown court.It turns out that the simplest way to compromise Boris is merely by using his own words against him as evidence. Starmer started with a gentle warm-up. Two weeks ago, the prime minister had boasted of our apparent success in dealing with the coronavirus. What part of a death rate of more than 30,000 – the highest in Europe – did he consider a success? Johnson barely even attempted an answer, muttering that he hoped one day the international data might produce the conclusions he wanted. Besides, now was not the time for any kind of public inquiry. Or ever, if possible.From there on it all went steadily downhill for Boris as Starmer observed it was the government’s own data that highlighted the UK’s unwanted top spot in European coronavirus deaths. Wasn’t it the fact that we had been too slow to lock down, to test, to trace and to provide personal protective equipment? Why had it taken 12 weeks to recognise the danger in care homes? When were we going to see a proper strategy as opposed to a few barely literate slogans?Boris visibly wilted under the most gentle of onslaughts. Maybe he’s still not fully recovered from his illness. Maybe his time in intensive care has provided him with a conscience that had hitherto been absent. Or maybe he somehow realises the game is up. That he was essentially a prime minister for the Good Times, someone to lift spirits with delusional appeals to jingoism. All of which could take place in a moral vacuum of no consequences for him. Now, though, he knows he’s been found out. That his failures have left him with blood on his hands that no amount of washing for 20 seconds while singing Happy Birthday can get clean. He has become Lady Macbeth.Whatever the truth, Boris could not prevent himself from sleepwalking into further incriminating himself. It was an outrage, he said, that NHS staff did not have adequate PPE. As if the situation was in no way his responsibility. Bluster had given way to dissociation. In his head he is both the prime minister and not the prime minister. Schrödinger’s PM.Thereafter, his logic collapsed in on itself. Having promised 250,000 tests back in March, he now promised to double the health secretary’s still largely fictitious figure of 100,000 to 200,000 by the end of the month. Matt Hancock shook his head in disbelief at this. This was clearly the first he had heard of this. Here was yet another ad hoc commitment on which he would be hung out to dry.Boris concluded by saying he was sorry not to be able to announce what measures he may or may not be introducing to ease the lockdown to parliament this week. Mainly because he still hadn’t a clue what they might be. Kill the economy or kill the nation? Maybe he would have more data by the time he spoke to the nation on Sunday. Or maybe he wouldn’t.But he did promise someone from the government would make a statement to parliament some time next week. Though it probably wouldn’t be him as he had things to do, such as choosing a new colour scheme for the nursery, and he didn’t know if he could stand another punishment caress from Starmer so soon. Hancock again looked ashen faced. For the second time in as many minutes, he was being lined up as the patsy.

To do so beforehand would risk a deadly second wave of coronavirus – one that could overwhelm the NHS.On Thursday the government is expected to formally extend the powers needed to continue the lockdown, but on Sunday the prime minister is likely to set out how the country might lift the strict measures that have paralysed the economy.What the government does and when will depend on safety considerations. Here we consider whether the government’s five tests have been met.It is increasingly clear that the much-feared surge that had threatened to overwhelm the health service has been overcome.As far back as mid-April, NHS Providers was confident enough to say hospitals should be able to cope with a peak. Now cancelled operations are being restarted, as less than a third of critical care beds are occupied by people with Covid-19.In London, one of the first Nightingale hospitals set up to help meet demand is to be placed on standby and will no longer admit patients.Coronavirus deaths in hospitals have been falling and a peak has now been passed. However, as the government’s deputy chief scientific adviser, Angela McLean, acknowledged on Tuesday, the UK is yet to “get to grips” with the number of deaths in care homes.The UK now has Europe’s worst coronavirus death toll, having reached 29,427 on Tuesday, exceeding Italy’s 29,029, which does not include suspected cases.McLean said the daily number of deaths had been falling steadily since the middle of April, though those in care homes were still rising in the week to 24 April.An indicator that will be closely watched in the coming days, the UK’s infection rate stopped rising on 21 April. However, England’s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said on Monday that new cases of Covid-19 across the UK needed to come down further. Figures released on Wednesday showed 6,111 cases had been recorded since Tuesday, up 1,700 on the day before. Yvonne Doyle, the director of health protection for Public Health England, said the figures “may be a matter of concern”.Doyle’s suggestion that testing could account for some of the increase in cases was greeted with scepticism, given testing appears to have gone down. The success of the contact-tracing app developed by the NHS, which is being trialled on the Isle of Wight from this week, will be a crucial element in meeting the test.The chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told MPs on Tuesday that the infection rate (R number) needed to be below one before lockdown measures could begin to be lifted. He said the current estimate of the value of R was between 0.6 and 0.9.There are ongoing worries about increased transport usage, supported by government data.Verdict: not met.An area where the government continues to face sustained criticism from the opposition and representative bodies for health and social care workers. On PPE, the pressure has lifted somewhat since 17 April, when hospitals came within hours of running out of supplies, but Boris Johnson conceded in parliament on Wednesday that there were continuing challenges.Operators of care homes complain that they are still struggling to source sufficient equipment and that staff are having trouble accessing testing.Testing remains an issue more broadly. While a programme for key workers has been ramped up, there are complaints that some testing centres are too far away from where they are needed and accessible only by car, while problems have arisen around delivery of home testing kits.As highlighted by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, the UK has fallen back below the 100,000 daily tests target reached at the end of last week, with only 69,463 carried out on Tuesday. The government also faces awkward questions about why it abandoned community testing early in March.In the absence of a vaccine, which is not expected to be available until next year, this is potentially the most difficult test to overcome. At a basic level, the transformation of the NHS and creation of Nightingale hospitals at least give some degree of confidence that there are the beds and resources to avoid the health service being overwhelmed.But among other factors, meeting this test relies on the widespread and effective creation of a contact-tracing system. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has described this as a “huge national undertaking of unprecedented scale and complexity”, involving the rollout of the new NHS app and the recruitment of an army of contact tracers.He previously said 18,000 tracers might be needed, but on Monday he indicated that this figure would be adjusted if a survey showed the virus was more prevalent than previously thought.A raft of questions persist, not least about whether the public will use the app in sufficient numbers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b78225d23a6fd63183669aadeb7598fdde709e17/0_86_3660_2195/master/3660.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19f4a47b90e4070edcb086c6976ca273","title":"home office accused of pressuring judiciary over immigration decisions","story":"Home Office criticised for requesting written reasons from judges when bail is granted to detaineesThe Home Office has been accused of interfering with the independence of the judiciary after it emerged that judges were asked to provide written explanations for a rise in the number of detainees released from immigration centres during the Covid-19 pandemic.In a letter to the president of the Tribunal, Immigration and Asylum Chamber dated 29 April 2020, the Home Office’s head of appeals, James Stevens, wrote: “The numbers of those in detention have reduced very significantly since the start of this emergency.” He went on to say: “The Home Office is somewhat surprised at the level of grants of bail in recent weeks.”Official figures record 1,225 people in detention centres on 1 January and 368 at the latest count – a reduction of almost three-quarters.Stevens outlined the ways in which the Home Office had responded to the risks coronavirus posed to detainees, before adding: “Where bail is granted I would ask you to consider whether immigration judges could provide written reasons for this.” Judges are not required by law to do this.Stevens wrote: “While I realise this is not a requirement under the procedure rules, it would assist the Home Office to fully understand the reasons why bail has been granted.”The Home Office is supposed to detain only those it can deport imminently, and its ability to do this has been drastically reduced due to flights being grounded. There have been three confirmed cases of Covid-19 among immigration detainees, and the risk of catching the virus remains high among those who are locked up for extended periods.﻿In a response dated 1 May, Michael Clements, the chamber’s president, issued a robust rejection of the Home Office’s request. “As independent judiciary we decide bail applications in accordance with the law, which includes the guidance which has been issued. There has been no change in either the law or the guidance,” he wrote.“The primary function of detention is accordingly to facilitate removal, and unless there are very powerful reasons to the contrary bail should be granted if there is no removal of the bail applicant within the reasonably foreseeable future.”He said that during the pandemic he had instituted a “minded to grant” bail process, giving the Home Office an early indication before a bail hearing took place that a judge was likely to grant bail unless the Home Office could provide specific reasons why this should not happen.“Unfortunately, the feedback that I am receiving is not only that the Home Office rarely consent to the grant of bail having seen the ‘minded to grant’ but that bail is still opposed at the hearing without any meaningful additional representations being given.”Adrian Berry, the chair of the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, said: “It is not appropriate for government to use its position outside of the courtroom to seek to influence decisions. The separation of powers between the government and judiciary is a core constitutional principle.”Bella Sankey, the director of Detention Action, which launched a legal challenge calling for the mass release of detainees during the pandemic, said: “This letter is a constitutional disgrace, entirely in keeping with a government that thinks it is above the law and not answerable to our sovereign parliament.“That the Home Office has sought to pressure the immigration tribunal over its bail decisions during a global pandemic shows alarming disrespect for the right to liberty, the rule of law and the separation of powers.”Toufique Hossain, of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who brought the Detention Action case, said: “Separation of powers is a basic principle of any democratic society to safeguard liberties and guard against tyranny.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebe5ffffc23ac470cf42753a8df9832a10801c91/0_109_3263_1958/master/3263.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c9aaf05665368511906dc0ace19590e","title":"parts of uk economy on life support since lockdown","story":"Chancellor needs to decide how to restart economy while supporting furloughed workersMore than a month into coronavirus lockdown measures large parts of the British economy are now on life support. Nearly one in four UK workers have been furloughed in the past fortnight, with their wages subsidised by the state in an attempt to stop the unfolding economic crisis – already expected to be the deepest recession since 1709 – from getting even worse.So far the government’s coronavirus job retention scheme (CJRS) has protected 6.3m jobs at some 800,000 firms, with a price tag for the exchequer amounting to more than £8bn by 3 May. According to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, as many as 4m redundancies have been avoided, but the workforce specialists have warned its “all or nothing” format must be reviewed to help furloughed staff back into work.As the cost of running the furlough scheme spirals with much of the jobs market now being propped up by the state, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is weighing up his options over how best to wean Britain off emergency financial aid as lockdown controls are lifted.Providing firms with information before the end of next week about whether the scheme will carry on is crucial. This deadline exists because if there is no further support coming then firms may plan redundnancies and, if they are going to cut more than 100 jobs they must first run a 45-day consultation. As the scheme will close at the end of June without action, the deadline for that consultation to be launched is 18 May.Sunak’s goal at the outset was to use the scheme to keep as many people as possible in their existing jobs. The theory was that there might be a V-shaped downturn and bounce back and the jobs subsidy would ensure workers would still be in place when the economy reopened.However, the costs have risen beyond the Treasury’s initial expectations as the number of workers on the scheme has mushroomed. The bounce back is no longer expected to be swift, especially in businesses such as hospitality, leading a senior government source to warn the Times that Britain had grown “addicted” to the furlough scheme.In danger of costing the taxpayer as much as the NHS to run, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates the CJRS could now cost £42bn over three months if 8.3 million people are furloughed. If continually run at these levels, the Resolution Foundation predicts it would cost an additional £12bn per month.Many within the Treasury regard the cost of inaction as far greater, with the priority to protect millions of jobs. In addition to harming personal lives and finances, stopping the scheme too soon could lead to a growing benefit bill, a weaker economy and greatly reduced tax revenue in future.Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said ministers needed to urgently adapt the scheme to align it with a phased restart of the economy.“Support must remain in place for firms that are not able to operate for an extended period and for those who face reduced capacity or demand for their services as a result of ongoing restrictions,” he added.The options the chancellor has included:Business leaders warn the planned sudden end of the scheme in June could be a “cliff edge” that would trigger a huge number of redundancies without action. Sunak has promised to remove such a risk.Ben Willmott, head of public policy at the CIPD, said: “Even if the government extended for another month it would give them more breathing time to develop a scheme that is more flexible and provides employers with a timeline for weaning themselves off furlough and bringing people back to work.”The problem is the cost: about £4bn a week.The government could take a gradual approach to restarting the economy by allowing some businesses to reopen before others. Those where there are higher risks of spreading infection, such as pubs and restaurants, could reopen last, and therefore need continuing taxpayer-funded wage support longest.There could however be challenges, as some activities do not fit neatly into a particular sector. In one example, some retailers have been able to stay open, while others have been forced to close.Cutting the subsidyKate Bell, head of rights at the TUC, said subsidies would still be required for people who cannot go to work once lockdown has been lifted, such as people who still need to shield themselves for health reasons, or who would struggle to get their children to school.She said another option would be to ask businesses to set out jobs and wages plans on how theyare using the scheme to prevent redundancies, should they wish to continue receiving support.“Companies need to make a profit, but they need their workers to do that. Most people want a return to work, but you could see that some conditionality makes the scheme easier to operate,” she added.Flexible working on furloughThe government could allow some part-time working under the furlough scheme, topping up workers’ salary payments. This could be used to ease businesses back to normal.Such a system could, however, be open to abuse. Some firms have forced staff to keep working while claiming public money to furlough them. The current breadth of the scheme, with limited flexibility on working time, was designed to reduce this risk, meaning tweaks and alterations could pave the way for further abuse.Back to the 1970sWhen Sunak first announced the scheme in March, he said it was for the “first time in our history” that the government was stepping in to help pay workers’ wages. He was wrong.During the turbulent economic troubles of the late 1970s, a temporary employment subsidy was available to support employers. Where at least 10 redundancies were threatened, the TES programme offered a subsidy of £20 a week for up to 12 months for each job saved. Started in the late 1970s as the country grappled with recession and 1.5 million unemployed, it was gradually made less generous until it was removed in 1984, the same year unemployment hit a postwar peak. A new TES could replace the job retention scheme.What are other countries doing?In the US one-off payments to iniduals worth $1,200 from the government have been used to soften the blow from soaring unemployment. Some 30 million Americans have signed on as unemployed in six weeks.Wage subsidy schemes have been used to protect jobs across Europe, and other countries are facing problems too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd1eda7b1523d96d9adc637a8dcccc3b3642e3d9/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbfa72d26b89c47a8661ad576f7dd8c6","title":"picnics and sunbathing on cards as pm expected to allow more time outside","story":"Boris Johnson said during PMQs that lockdown measures would be eased from Monday Picnics, sunbathing and unlimited rambles will be among the first activities to be allowed when the lockdown loosens, it emerged on Wednesday, after Boris Johnson announced that restrictions would begin to ease from Monday.With the stringent restrictions due to be reviewed on Thursday – and details to be announced on Sunday – the prime minister is expected to change the rules so that people would be able to leave the house repeatedly in a single day, so long as they keep a safe distance from anyone from outside their household.But government sources cautioned against expecting an imminent reopening of the economy, with one saying: “We just aren’t in a space of significant changes at all.”The changes – which are likely to leave the public hanging on weather forecasts in the hope of conditions that will make more time out of the house possible – were mooted after Johnson said at prime minister’s questions that the government wanted to “get going with some of these measures on Monday”.Government Twitter accounts meanwhile began broadcasting a new, more nuanced message – “Stay Safe, Save Lives” – on Wednesday, in a hint that the stark “Stay Home, Save Lives” slogan is set to be ditched.But the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said that there could still be localised lockdowns even as restrictions lift nationally, setting out “interventions in smaller, micro-communities where you’re seeing the virus take hold again”.When the lockdown came into force, some experts were concerned that “fatigue” would set in if restrictions on the public’s daily lives were imposed too soon. But compliance was much higher than the government had anticipated.Now the Conservative election supremo, Isaac Levido, has been helping to draw up the communications plan for “phase two” of the crisis, as Johnson has called it.The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said that allowing people to spend more time outdoors in “small, defined groups” was one of the five “initial options” Scotland is likely to pursue when the scientific evidence justifies lifting some constraints.Scientific evidence suggesting transmission of the virus is less likely in open spaces has led ministers to focus on allowing more outdoor activities. However, pub beer gardens and coffee shops with outdoor seating are likely to remain closed, as are most shops, amid fears that it would be difficult for them to enforce social distancing.Meanwhile the continued high number of new Covid-19 cases – 6,111 on Tuesday – is likely to deter ministers from more radical steps.Since the lockdown began six weeks ago, the public have been urged only to leave their homes to buy essentials such as food or medicine to exercise once a day or to go to work if they cannot do so from home.The restriction on exercise has seen police officers accused of overreach, for moving on lone sunbathers or scolding members of the public for taking a rest on a park bench.The government has been urging local authorities to keep parks open where possible, and confirmed that businesses such as DIY stores and garden centres can operate click-and-collect services, where goods can be picked up while observing social distancing.Significant changes in schools are also expected, with teachers and unions expecting that Johnson will on Sunday confirm the 1 June start date for schools to reopen, beginning with children aged 10 and 11 in year six.Other primary year groups are expected to follow shortly after, and then for years 10 and 12 – the first years for GCSE and A-level courses respectively – to also return to secondary schools.The decision means that pupils in England could return months before those in Scotland, after Nicola Sturgeon warned that Scottish schools may be shut until the end of the summer holidays. Scotland’s school year ends on 24 June, three weeks before England.Questions remain about how schools in England will be expected to source personal protective equipment, especially for staff in reception classes where children as young as four require close attention.In a joint letter to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, the National Education Union and Parentkind – formerly the Parent-Teachers’ Association UK – warned “there is a risk of chaos and a greater spread of the virus” unless parents and staff were reassured about the safety of reopening.Other measures still under consideration include the creation of social “bubbles”, allowing households to mix with a limited number of others. Downing Street has not ruled out this option – though some ministers are sceptical about how it could be enforced in practice.One Whitehall source warned that if people failed to stick to the rules carefully, it could lead to “a catastrophic epidemiological demonstration of the rule of six degrees of separation”.Ministers are also keen to get more people back to work where it is impractical for them to work from home, though draft guidelines for safe working have prompted a furious backlash from unions this week.None of the changes announced on Sunday are likely to affect those with underlying health conditions, who have been asked to “shield” themselves from the virus by continuing to remain permanently at home.The relatively modest shift is likely to infuriate Conservative MPs who have criticised the impingement on the public’s liberties and the economic costs of the lockdown.Chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee, Graham Brady, has called for the lifting of “arbitrary rules and limitations on freedom as quickly as possible” and suggested the public had been “a little too willing to stay at home”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a863d32516cac7100892c0a2a50957e3a483a165/0_0_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f18f805d4267b08ec1ca4a0b2dbc7d2","title":"black hole found 1000 light years from earth","story":"Object found in HR 6819 system is the closest to Earth yet known – and is unusually darkAstronomers say they have discovered a black hole on our doorstep, just 1,000 light years from Earth.It was found in a system called HR 6819, in the constellation Telescopium.The system appears through a telescope as a single bright star, but telltale signs in the light emitted have previously revealed there to be two stars present.Now experts say they have further analysed the data to discover there is another body within the system: a black hole with a mass over four times that of our sun, and the closest to Earth found so far.“We realised that one could not describe what we saw with just two stars,” said Dietrich Baade, an emeritus astronomer at European Southern Observatory (ESO) and a co-author of the study.In other words, a black hole – an object typically formed from the gravitational collapse of a massive star.The upshot, said Baade, is a so-called “hierarchical triple system”, which he explained by reference to a child’s mobile.“On the one branch of the mobile you have two stars hanging, one of which is not visible, which is black – that is the black hole. And these two objects are orbiting each other,” he said. “And the other branch of the mobile you have one star which is much farther away from the other two.”The black hole is unusual. “The hallmark of this black hole is that it is truly black,” he said. “Almost all the other black holes that we know are in the Milky Way – and there are only two dozen of them – shine very brightly in X-rays.”Baade said the other black holes each had a companion star that feeds them with gas. However, this does not appear to be the case for the newly discovered black hole and its nearby star.“This star is not so massive that it loses a lot of gas and therefore the black hole is starving and that makes it so dark.”Baade added that HR 6819 – or rather, its stars – can be seen by the naked eye. “If you want to see it really overhead, you need to be at the southern tip of South America,” he said. The new work, which is published in the journal Astronomy \u0026amp Astrophysics, is based on data collected using telescopes at ESO’s La Silla Observatory in Chile.“Theoretical models suggest that in the Milky Way there are between 100m and 1bn black holes,” said Baade. “We are finding a tip of an iceberg.”The discovery could shed light on an unusual system in the constellation Gemini called LB-1. This system has previously been suggested to be composed of a star and a tremendously massive black hole – a finding that has foxed experts. Baade noted LB-1 appears to be very similar to HR 6819.He said that suggests LB-1 could be a triple system, meaning its “dark object” would be a black hole of a more normal mass, or possibly a neutron star.Dr Ziri Younsi, an expert on black holes at University College London, who was not involved with the research, said: “It’s remarkable that a black hole has been found so close to Earth,” noting for context that the centre of our galaxy is about 25,000 light years from Earth.“This new study hints at the exciting prospect of a whole population of stellar-mass black holes lurking in our Galaxy,” Younsi said. “It also offers a potential new means to detect many more systems comprising such quiescent black holes in our galactic neighbourhood in the near future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36f49a349300cde3b6871ba86c5575f63ea435f2/0_38_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=465e2c45d64ad9b5b65bfc2cf1f4b28e","title":"epsom face crucial meeting on plans for derby in july with exclusion zone horse racing","story":"The Jockey Club’s commitment to staging this year’s Derby and Oaks at their traditional home of Epsom Downs was confirmed on Wednesday. Plans have been published proposing to use several miles of fencing to seal off the track and its surroundings if Epsom \u0026amp Ewell council approves a proposal to run both Classics behind closed doors on a Saturday in July or August, with 4 July the early favourite.Epsom’s scheme to create an exclusion zone around its famous 12-furlong circuit will be considered next Tuesday by a special meeting of the Epsom and Walton Downs Conservators.Epsom is situated on downland which is normally open to the public and, in addition to around 40,000 paying spectators in the stands, up to 100,000 traditionally crowd into the middle of the course and its surroundings to watch the Classic for free. This year’s Derby has already been postponed from its original date in early June because of the coronavirus pandemic, with early July seen as the best slot for a rearranged race under the British Horseracing Authority’s “best-case” scenario for a resumption of racing.Newmarket staged the Derby several times during the first and second world wars, but the unique challenge of Epsom is integral to the race’s challenge and appeal. As a result, the Jockey Club is keen to stage both the Derby and Oaks on the same, one-day card this year, despite the logistical challenges this poses.David Gulland, a Liberal Democrat councillor for Epsom \u0026amp Ewell, told BBC Radio Surrey on Wednesday that the proposals would need to be considered in detail before being approved.“Normally, you’d get 100,000 people coming down but a closed event will not quite be the same thing,” Gulland said. “I’m really pleased that the Jockey Club is trying to find an innovative way of doing it, but we need to think about the wider issues and obviously the health aspects.“What we don’t want is the appearance of it just happening to suit a small sector of the community, and also we don’t want to have a way people are encouraged to gather together in groups when it’s not yet healthy to do so.“No one knows what the health situation will be in July and August, and even if it’s fenced off, there’s a danger that people will be attracted up there. It’s a huge open area and you don’t want to encourage behaviour which might not be appropriate, even in July or August.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdb549a2f1bf1bf31e89b740b5572b3595894d4e/0_16_2769_1662/master/2769.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=627a4d845700cc6e4819de79c6d4fda0","title":"airbnb to make quarter of its global workforce redundant","story":"Staff losing jobs receive email within hours of co-founder outlining plans in blogpostAirbnb has set out plans to make 1,900 staff redundant, about a quarter of its global workforce, as it forecast revenues in 2020 would be half the $4.8bn (£3.9bn) generated in 2019.Brian Chesky, its chief executive and co-founder, described coronavirus as “the most harrowing crisis of our lifetime”. He told staff: “We don’t know exactly when travel will return. When travel does return, it will look different.”Airbnb has employees in 24 countries. Its headquarters are in San Francisco and its European head office is in Dublin, where it employs about 500 people. Some of the deepest job cuts are likely to be in newer areas of the business such as Airbnb  “Luxe”, which offers what it describes as upmarket homes and dedicated trip designers.“People will want options that are closer to home, safer, and more affordable,” said Chesky.Airbnb said there were signs of of a mild recovery in some locations, adding that was growing evidence of travellers in Europeans booking properties in their own countries this summer rather than abroad.Airbnb joins airlines and travel operators cutting staff numbers during the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, British Airways announced 12,000 staff would be made redundant, and on Tuesday Virgin Atlantic said it would cut 3,000 jobs and mothball its Gatwick operations.The collapse in Airbnb’s revenue has thwarted its plans to float on the stock market this year. The projected $40bn-plus flotation would also have earned many of its staff large payouts, as early entrants into the company were partly remunerated in stock options.This year, Airbnb shored up its finances with $2bn in new loans and funding, which according to reports suggested a valuation of about $18bn, much below earlier expectations.Airbnb started life as AirBed \u0026amp Breakfast in 2008 after Chesky and another co-founder, Joe Gebbia, let out their apartment in San Francisco. The platform has about 150 million users and 7m property listings across the world.In a blogpost detailing the job cuts, Chesky told staff: “I have a deep feeling of love for all of you.” Within hours, those being made redundant received an email invitation for a departure meeting, with US and Canadian tstaff told they would leave by next Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c61ed83b233cdf16fc67c990ee53acb16ceef34/252_145_1361_817/master/1361.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=070714f6c17cbbfe8f7415acc20e90f6","title":"microsoft launches faster surface book 3 and surface go 2","story":"Windows-maker updates top and cheapest PCs, and launches new headphones Microsoft is launching a revamped line of its most powerful and cheapest Windows 10 PCs, the Surface Book 3 and Surface Go 2, as it adjusts to continue operations during the pandemic.The new products, announced by blogpost rather than an event, are Microsoft’s premium computers competing directly with the likes of Apple and Dell, but with more novel designs.Alongside Nvidia GeForce consumer graphics processors, Microsoft has also added the option for Nvidia’s Quadro graphics chips for the first time, which are commonly used in workstations in academia and commercial settings.Surface Book 3 starts at $1,599 in the US and will be available from 21 May.

How can you prepare effectively to make the most of the remote interview process? This handy seven-point guide will help you keep in mind the questions you should be asking any potential new members of your staffroom. The teachers on your candidate shortlist might know their ABCs from their hypotenuses – but what do you need to do to get the best out of them in a remote interview?1. Prepare your questions – and answersAn online interview is like any other – make sure you’ve set your interview agenda. If you’re interviewing with another member of staff make sure you’ve decided who will ask what questions – and also, who will answer any questions from your candidates. Key questions you should be prepared to answer would include: What makes the school unique? What does the school need to improve? Does the school provide personalised, professional development? How would pupils, parents and other teachers describe your school? And be prepared to include a range of pupils and teachers in the recruitment process. Those who do this now should find themselves ahead of the recruitment process.2. Find a quiet space When you’re conducting the interview make sure you’re in a quiet space, with a background that is tidy and clear. It’s also worth considering how you position your microphone and camera lens so that you can present yourself from the waist upwards. Simple stuff I know, but you’d be surprised how many do not consider camera angle and lighting positioning. It could make the difference in a successful appointment!3. Ensure your technology is up to date It’s worth making sure your browser is running the latest updates and that you’ve got a reliable broadband connection. Check both camera and microphone are working with your fellow teachers before you are on an interview video call. It’s worth giving candidates details of the technology you use in advance of your interview, so they have time to familiarise themselves with the differences between Zoom, Skype, Google Hangouts or Microsoft Teams.4. Prepare to multitaskLearn how to speak to the camera lens, make notes as well as use the video technology to navigate between your camera, the screen and the microphone. When you are not speaking, for example, you may wish to mute your microphone so that the interviewee does not hear any distracting background noises. If you take time to rehearse, this will also help schools make better appointments today rather than after discovering where and how the technology lets you down.5. Offer to let candidates speak to colleagues Once you have set the interview agenda it can be helpful to arrange for an informal meeting with colleagues already working at the school. Select a range of teachers who best represent your school, to show your potential as a good employer. For example, a member of the support staff, the school receptionist, a member of staff who has just joined the school and a member of staff who is leaving the school. You’re looking to give an indication of the school’s culture. This may be difficult to achieve remotely, but it’s not impossible. Plan to have this in place, now.6. Offer a pupil interview if possibleTechnology may also be able to offer the capacity for a pupil interview experience, or perhaps even an online lesson for the candidates to teach with the panel observing as part of the application process. If you are able to provide the opportunity for candidates to teach a lesson online, it’s critical to offer as much information about the lesson and the children for it to be an effective exercise. Of course, during a pandemic, going about teaching online will be immensely different from teaching face-to-face: watch to see how teachers engage the pupils in a virtual classroom. How do candidates communicate effectively through a camera lens? Can they question, hold to account, and provide feedback to pupils online?7. Can you offer a virtual tour?One of the key opportunities at interview is a tour of the school. Doing this remotely presents a significant challenge, but again, those innovative school leaders will already be working ahead of the bell curve. Beyond the school website, most schools will have a range of images of events taking place on site, with photo galleries and online videos. It’s worth making sure your school’s social media strategy shares positive news stories with the general public, as well as pupils and parents, and prospective teachers. With most schools open during Covid-19 in a limited capacity, there will be an option for school leadership teams who are currently on-site to provide applicants with a virtual tour of the school facilities, classrooms and office spaces. This will allow potential candidates to ask questions or gain a perception of potential employment opportunities.Appointing teachers during a pandemic is difficult, but it’s not impossible. To ensure your school isn’t missing key appointments when all schools resume full service, it is critical that your school considers remote recruitment ideas now.If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b64c0f636f3690d5155b3d549d130742b4b3be93/0_118_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d50164f93cb2f968cf2f8c49cea81a27","title":"looking to teach at a new school heres how to find the one thats right for you","story":"How do you get a feel for what a school is really like when you can’t walk through the playground or see what’s on the whiteboards? For teachers in the remote recruiting market, here’s how to make the most of the virtual experienceWhether it’s your first job after teacher training or you’re an experienced hand, evaluating a potential school is a crucial part of the interview process. But how do you do that remotely? Here are top tips for teachers applying to work at a new school under lockdown.Prepare for remote interviewsAlthough the coronavirus pandemic presents us with many challenges, it’s worth remembering that schools and supply agencies have been recruiting teachers online for almost 20 years. Independent and English language international schools are increasingly recruiting teachers via video to work with them overseas. The current lockdown has forced all schools across the UK to reconsider how they recruit teachers.Be tech-readyOn both sides of the camera it is critical to check the video technology, the microphone and your background environment when conducting an interview via video. What apps will they be using? Have you used them before? If not, rehearse with a friend.Think the process throughIt is crucial to find a school which best meets your needs. Find as many schools as possible before you begin any application process. This will give you motivation, as well as building up a network for future job opportunities.Visit the school – virtuallyIn order to determine which type of environment you feel most comfortable with, one important planning aspect to consider is your journey to and from the school, should you be successfully appointed. Under normal circumstances it’s worth considering a trial journey during peak commuter hours to see if the journey is manageable. Under the current conditions, it’s worth trying to arrange for a virtual tour of the school site – just as you would for a position that involves relocating to the other side of the country, or an international job. A conscientious school leader should be more than happy to take candidates on a video tour. This is even more critical during lockdown when all schools are struggling with recruitment.Prepare your applicationLook at the key facts listed on the job advert, and evaluate how they match up with the person specification – not the job description. Think carefully about what you can offer the school. Initial research on examination performance, pupil demographics and inspection reports will help you identify key priorities in the application. It would also be wise to consider why you want to work at the school. For more on this, see the five-minute interview plan. Regarding referees and references, it is always worth asking permission and giving those key people a “heads-up”. References are frequently requested with limited time for the referee to respond, putting them under pressure. You don’t want to put your job application in jeopardy!Submitting your application Spellcheck, spellcheck, spellcheck! Whatever you do, do not copy and paste bog-standard educational cliches and fire off application after application without due diligence. I’ve seen thousands of applications thrown in the bin because they accidentally mention another school’s name, have grammatical errors or include inappropriate information (no one needs to know your astrological birth sign!). Ask a friend to proofread your application. Show the reader that you have conducted some research, posing questions and thoughts, as well as some solutions with evidence of things that you have contributed towards in your current role. Remember, you can discuss finer details during the interview, so keep the facts concise.Plan your questions The easiest way to discover if a school leadership team is on track is to ask direct questions at the interview. For example: “How many teachers left your school last year?” “How much of the overall budget does the school protect for professional development?’’ “Why should I work at your school?” “Is the school budget in deficit, if so by how much?” If these questions are avoided, it’s a good indication that this might not be the school for you.Nail that interview!Be prepared, rehearse potential questions and answers, pick out what you will wear on the day – even for an online interview. Show interest and be conscientious by keeping your questions and answers concise. Whatever you do, do not be late: in an online interview, there really are no traffic excuses.Have your answers readyBe prepared to answer a range of challenging questions, and rehearse a variety of scenarios where you can provide concise answers. What would colleagues say about you? What area of the teaching standards do you most need to work on? What has been the greatest challenge in your career to date? Where do you want to be in three years’ time? Why do you want to work in this school? When it comes to “awkward” questions, they can often be a test of how professional and measured you will be in your response, rather than the answer itself.Final questionsFinally, asking questions at the end of an interview, always have two or three questions prepared. Whatever you do, make sure you ask them. It shows the interview panel that you are prepared, interested and it is your one opportunity to put them on the spot and turn the tables in the process.If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55f1622a0eb54040ce4ec2c7da77870f2d120e7d/0_276_5121_3073/master/5121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=703fa1814e91baa9df95c9651da83d53","title":"the new rules of remote recruiting how to prepare for an online interview","story":"The Covid-19 lockdown has completely reshaped the way companies operate – even once restrictions are eased, many expect remote working to stay. So how can you impress a potential new boss from home?Candidates in their dressing gowns, dogs and children running about, partners in the background watching TV, or piles of dirty washing up on the kitchen counter – with 25 years in the recruitment sector, David Stone has heard it all when it comes to disastrous video interviews. “When people are working at home, because it’s your personal space, a lot of candidates completely overlook the fact that it’s still a formal first meeting,” Stone, the founder of MRL Consulting Group, says. “It’s amazing what you see going on in the background.”Holding interviews remotely – whether by phone or video – isn’t a new concept, particularly for companies that have built remote, international teams. Nor is the use of technology in the recruitment process, with an influx of artificial-intelligence tools that source and screen candidates hitting the market in recent years. There are algorithms that can analyse candidates’ tone of voice, facial expressions, and speech patterns during video pre-assessments, scoring them against an ideal profile for that role. Graduates have reportedly spent thousands of pounds learning how to beat these systems.But for many companies, still recruiting during the global Covid-19 lockdown, moving the process online can be a daunting prospect. Stone recommends all involved – recruiter and candidate – treat a remote interview like a traditional, face-to-face meeting as much as possible. “Get up, get showered, put a suit on,” he says. “Pay consideration to what can be seen on that camera behind you. Make sure you’ve got an hour’s worth of peace and quiet.” Some candidates may be more nervous appearing on video than they would be in person, he adds. “You’ve got to try and get past that. Build rapport, put them at their ease, get them talking about subjects they’re comfortable talking about so they relax.”Ellie Wilson, the co-founder and operations director of Virtalent, has run hundreds of remote interviews since launching her virtual assistant service six years ago. She’s found the recruitment process much more efficient when it’s all online. “We can go from someone submitting an assessment to having the final interview and running background checks almost within 48 hours,” she says. “I certainly don’t think you lose anything just because you can’t shake that person’s hand. I ask the same questions to a candidate that I would if they were sitting right in front of me. For me, nothing changes – I try to extract the information that I need to be assured that this is the right person for the job: can I see this person working with us, working with our clients? Do they give me confidence?”While recruiters may prefer to do the first round of remote interviews over the phone, Wilson says it is important to see the person you’re speaking to at some stage in the process. That doesn’t have to be via a bespoke HR platform – video conference tools such as Zoom, Skype, and Microsoft Teams work just as well. “If they’re going to be working remotely, you also need to be reassured they have the right set-up at home,” she adds. “I check that they have a dedicated desk area, they have an appropriate seat, and it looks free from distraction.”Candidates and interviewers alike should switch on all equipment 15 minutes beforehand, think about getting the lighting and camera angle right, test microphones, and put phones and any push notifications on silent, says flexible working consultant and executive coach Marilyn Devonish. “When speaking, look directly into the camera so the other person feels like you’re looking at them,” she adds, rather than getting distracted by your own image on the screen (Zoom has a “hide myself” option, which can help). She recommends interviewees also do a practice run-through with friends or family: “Think about making sure your personality comes out. So if you’re going for a job that needs a motivated self-starter, that’s what you’ve got to be when you’re on camera.” Candidates interviewed by video also have the luxury of being able to use printouts of the job description and any other reference notes without the interviewer’s knowledge.Recruiters should be mindful of including more visual and linguistic cues than they might use in person to show they’re following what the candidate is saying. “Things like saying ‘right’, ‘OK’, ‘great’,” Devonish adds. “If the sound drops, this is not the time to be scared or too polite – say: ‘I’m sorry, I missed that.’ Both sides need to make sure they can hear each other clearly.” A clear explanation for how the process will work should also be provided in good time, including the necessary passwords and access links. And always have a plan B. “Let them have a telephone number so that if the technology fails, they can call you. And if something does go wrong, watch how the candidate reacts – if they completely lose their head, that actually tells you a little bit about how they operate under pressure.”Stone believes the Covid-19 lockdown could mark a seismic shift in the way companies operate going forward. “This episode has proven that you don’t have to stop in your entirety when something like this does occur,” he says. “We’ve got some clients who are interviewing remotely and then onboarding new recruits by video too, just having a laptop delivered to their house. They’re hiring highly skilled people having never met them in their lives.”If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09d8cfd16ed0910528c43363c029e4020e11fbf6/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=96754cc0cce5e3a0e5a71426aa0a9f2a","title":"coronavirus latesta glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The eurozone faces an existential threat if the economic recoveries of its 19 member states are insufficiently even, the EU’s economic commissioner warns.Some countries are expected to suffer significantly more than others during what is expected to be the deepest recession since the Great Depression. “Such ergence poses a threat to the single market and the euro area – yet it can be mitigated through decisive, joint European action,” Paolo Gentiloni says.The director general of the World Health Organization warns of the risks of returning to lockdown if countries emerging from pandemic restrictions do not manage transitions “extremely carefully and in a phased approach”.Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus lists a series of steps needed before countries should lift restrictions, such as surveillance controls and health system preparedness.The country’s top football league, the Bundesliga, is set to resume this month – one of various restrictions to be lifted as Germans are once again allowed to meet a limited number of friends and family and some shops are allowed to reopen.The country still has a long way to go, its chancellor, Angela Merkel, says, and its 16 states will each be able to operate an “emergency break” if faced with a surge in new infections.The British government will set out details of its plan to ease lockdown on Sunday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, says, adding his hope that some measures could come into force the following day.Speaking in parliament for the first time since being hospitalised with Covid-19, Johnson says “every death is a tragedy”, calling the statistics “appalling”.The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, warns that abruptly ending nearly eight weeks of lockdown would be “unforgivable” as he seeks parliamentary approval to further extend the state of emergency.His efforts to renew his mandate for a lockdown that has imposed strict confinement on nearly 47 million Spaniards are being rejected by his rightwing opponents.China will not invite international experts in to investigate the source of Covid-19 while the pandemic is still raging, its UN ambassador says. And, continuing the diplomatic back-and-forth between Beijing and Washington, China’s foreign ministry says the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is wrong to claim he has evidence suggesting the virus originated in a Chinese lab.“We are starting to near 3,000 deceased, a horrifyingly large number,” Sweden’s state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, says. The country’s public health agency reports that a total of 23,918 cases have been confirmed and 2,941 deaths recorded an increase of 87 deaths from the day before.Rather than enforcing a lockdown, Sweden has allowed many businesses to remain open, while asking citizens to keep their distance.Iran records 1,680 new infections, the highest daily figure since 11 April, taking its overall caseload beyond the 100,000 mark. The country’s apparent success in controlling the epidemic has gone into reverse, with a sharp rise in the number of new daily infections over the past four days.At least 90,000 healthcare workers globally are believed to have been infected, the International Council of Nurses (ICN) says, noting that the the true figure could be as much as twice that.It says more than 260 nurses have died amid reports of continuing shortages of protective equipment, as it urges authorities to keep more accurate records."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c7bb44d315099ee727a15b330e96b164c71250c/0_1586_3712_2227/master/3712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e6007678a74e87dee1708e9107e5acc","title":"cycling could increase five fold in london after lockdown","story":"Mayor and agency planning fast-track new cycle routes and wider pavementsCycling in London could increase tenfold and pavements could be widened to allow for physical distancing and queueing outside shops, under plans to overhaul the capital’s streets post-lockdown.As part of the London Streetscape plans, new walking and cycling routes along major corridors would be fast-tracked , including temporary cycle lanes along routes such as the busy thoroughfare of Euston Road.City Hall is under pressure to increase tube services but unions have expressed concern about doing so without agreement on protecting the health of passengers and staff.The UK government has said that these five tests have to be met before they will consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:Boris Johnson said at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday that a crucial part of efforts to get transport to run safely involved “a bigger and more expansive tube service” so that people could observe physical distancing,But the office of the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said millions of journeys a day would need to be made by other means, with London’s public transport capacity potentially running at a fifth of pre-crisis levels.If people were to switch even a small fraction of those journeys to cars, Khan said, London risked grinding to a halt, air quality would worsen and road danger would increase.The mayor and Transport for London (TfL) said they would work with boroughs to focus on three areas:TfL said its modelling suggested there could be a tenfold increase in distances cycled, and up to five times the amount of walking compared with pre-coronavirus levels, if travel demand returned.Pavements have already been doubled in size at locations such as Camden High Street and Stoke Newington High Street, and widened at six other locations – two in Southwark and one each in Hackney, Lambeth, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Croydon.Calling on anyone who can work from home to continue to do so, Khan said: “I urge the government and boroughs to work with us to enable Londoners to switch to cleaner, more sustainable forms of transport and reduce the pressure on other parts of our transport network once the lockdown is eased.”The plans were welcomed by organisations such as Living Streets, a walking charity, which said the pandemic had highlighted the importance that walking plays in people’s lives.“Where London’s pavements aren’t suitable for safe social distancing, it is vital widening happens to ensure people aren’t forced into the paths of oncoming traffic,” said its director, Stephen Edwards.However, there was criticism from the Green party, which said the mayor was now “tackling a handful of high streets” to make up for “snail’s pace progress” in recent years.“Key workers have led the way by taking up cycling to make safe, socially distanced trips to work, and the mayor is trailing behind playing catch-up when we’ve already suffered weeks of drivers speeding and making our roads much more dangerous,” said Caroline Russell, a London assembly member."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c995d24d6e5bfffb18e70ae3a1882ea49a3183f8/0_418_3060_1837/master/3060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5b124ba50f2c0419aaf18d8abf66e18","title":"rashes headaches tingling who lists less common coronavirus symptoms covid 19","story":"Studies have examined some of the more unusual signs of Covid-19The World Health Organization lists the most common symptoms of Covid-19 as fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Others include a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion, pain, diarrhoea and the loss of sense of taste andor smell. But there are also other more unusual symptoms that patients have presented.Patients in several countries have reported rashes on their toes, resembling chilblains, in many cases unaccompanied by any of the usual symptoms of the virus. The condition has been dubbed “Covid toe”. The rashes can take the form of red or purple lesions and, despite the name, can be found on the side or sole of the foot, or even on hands and fingers. The European Journal of Pedeatric Dermatology reported an “epidemic” of cases among children and adolescents in Italy. It said that unlike other rashes associated with coronavirus, it had not been previously observed.Conjunctivitis has been a rare symptom in cases of Covid-19, with viral particles being found in tears. In the UK, the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and College of Optometrists says: “It is recognised that any upper respiratory tract infection may result in viral conjunctivitis as a secondary complication, and this is also the case with Covid-19. However, it is unlikely that a person would present with viral conjunctivitis secondary to Covid-19 without other symptoms of fever or a continuous cough as conjunctivitis seems to be a late feature where is has occurred.”Some patients have complained about a tingling, fizzing or even burning sensation. Dr Waleed Javaid, the director of infection prevention and control at Mount Sinai hospital in New York, told Today it was likely the patient’s immune response to Covid-19 – rather than the virus itself – was causing such sensations. He said: “There’s a widespread immune response that is happening. Our immune cells get activated so a lot of chemicals get released throughout our body and that can present or feel like there’s some fizzing. When our immune response is acting up, people can feel different sensations … I have heard of similar experiences in the past with other illnesses.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e50b99eab1f2a6cefc8ca93a5e1f49240b529a07/55_57_2782_1669/master/2782.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=440d657bc7fa64479fb1396882569ee5","title":"short film discovery may be first spanish talkie made by woman maria forteza","story":"Mallorca, an eight-minute documentary, could be Spain’s first talking picture directed by a womanAlmost a century after it was shot, a brief but beautifully made documentary that could be the first talking picture directed by a woman in Spain has been discovered after the forgotten and miscatalogued footage was re-examined during the coronavirus lockdown.The man’s brother, a film producer, thought there might be something of interest to the archive and several cans of film were handed over to the Filmoteca Española.For 38 years, Mallorca languished in the collection, wrongly identified as a silent 1926 film made by a male director. But as the lockdown began, Filmoteca workers took another look at the documentary, which dwells, sometimes hypnotically, on fishermen on their boats, children playing in the streets, and a monk drawing water from a well.Besides the soundtrack, they were struck by the director’s name: María Forteza. “We were looking at what we had on hard disk and when we sat down to watch the film we went, ‘Hang on! This doesn’t fit together properly,’” said Josetxo Cerdán, the head of the national archive. “The most surprising thing was seeing that a woman’s name came up as director.”The team set about investigating the director as best they could, but Forteza proved elusive. There were no traces of her in film archives, although the film’s camera operator, Ramón Úbeda, was known for working in the Balearic Islands.The taxi that appears towards the beginning of the documentary – and the fact that Úbeda patented a specific sound system in 1935 that is not mentioned in the credits – has allowed researchers to date the film to somewhere between 1932 and 1934.If their informed guess is correct, then Mallorca could be the first talking picture directed by a woman in Spain. Until now, Rosario Pi’s 1935 film El gato montés (The Mountain Cat) was thought to be the first such picture.But for all their efforts and determination, Cerdán and his team could not get any closer to the mysterious Forteza. The breakthrough was made earlier this week by Laura Jurado, a journalist for the film website Industrias del Cine.After some intensive Googling, Jurado discovered  Forteza was a singer and variety artist – and the wife of Ramón Úbeda. She also tracked down some of the couple’s surviving relatives.Cerdán, who is taking nothing for granted until the film is definitively dated, says it is well shot and structured, and far better than most of the “aesthetic documentaries” of the time that were intended to show off the beauties of the countryside and of historical monuments.“They tend to be painfully dull: you get a monument, then another monument, then a mountain,” he said. “But this isn’t like that. You have the explanatory prologue and the little narrative of the boat arriving on the island and then the tour. The camera is also very well positioned in every shot.”Headlines about Mallorca being the first soundtracked picture directed by a woman in Spain are all very well, added Cerdán. “But I think the important thing we need to ask ourselves is why, in 2020, are there still women’s names we aren’t familiar with when it comes to film directing? What’s happened for it to be this way? Six weeks ago, we thought the history had all been written and that this would have been impossible.”The film, which can be watched online until 8 May as part of the Filmoteca’s lockdown season, is also evidence of the need for archives. “They can deliver a lot of surprises and a lot of stories we don’t know about. It helps us to understand the history of cinema, but also the history of this country,” said Cerdán.Marta Selva, a retired professor of cinema and former co-director of the Barcelona international women’s film festival, also admires the film and is pleased to see it finally emerge into the light. For her, too, it is proof of the need for archives – and of the value of always going back for a second look.“For me the important thing is that they’ve taken the time to have another look at something that was thought to be by a male director,” said Selva. “They haven’t downplayed it and said, ‘Oh well, it’s only seven minutes and it’s a bit touristy.’ The film is important in its own right, but also because of its place in the history of Spanish documentary making.”• Watch the short film Mallorca here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81574a33d843c3746842b9568b8857b64fd9e5ad/925_312_4545_2727/master/4545.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b008d3ace4a438a1d28ca982c38cbc7e","title":"better world coronavirus young europeans democracy universal basic income","story":"Most Europeans support a universal basic income, yet young people doubt democracy’s capacity to deliver changeThose two contrasting but equally striking survey results show how high the stakes will be as we emerge from the immediate medical emergency, and face the subsequent economic pandemic and its political fallout. What kind of historical moment will this turn out to be, for Europe and the world? It could lead us to the best of times. It could lead us to the worst of times.The proposal for a universal basic income was until recently often dismissed as far-out and utopian. But during the anti-pandemic lockdowns, many developed countries have introduced something close to it. Spain’s economy minister has said that its “minimum vital income” could become a permanent instrument in the country’s system. Hardly a day passes now when I do not read another article suggesting that universal basic income, or some variant of it, is an idea whose time has come.This would be one ingredient of a possible future in which we managed to turn one of the greatest crises of the postwar world into one of its greatest opportunities. We can address the soaring inequality, both economic and cultural, which has been eroding the foundations even of established liberal democracies like Britain and the US. Having learned to work in different ways, more from home and with less unnecessary travel, we turn this into a new life-work model. After turning out on our balconies and rooftops, all across Europe, to applaud the doctors, nurses, social care and other essential workers, we do not forget them once the medical danger has passed. Not only do they get a better deal socially and economically – the postwar slogan “homes fit for heroes” comes to mind – but there is also what Polish populists slyly call a “redistribution of respect”. And in making that necessary redistribution, we also deprive the nationalist populists of their electoral appeal.At the same time, we recognise that a planet stalked by genuinely global threats, such as this virus and climate change, requires more international cooperation, not less. And the EU, which earlier this week convened an international meeting to raise funds for fighting Covid-19, becomes a prime mover of global collective action.That’s the dream. But then there’s the nightmare. This may be a postwar moment, but what if it turns out to be more like the years after the first world war than the post-1945 liberal and social democratic reconstruction. The nationalist impulses we see in Donald Trump and Xi Jinping become even more pronounced. With beggar-my-neighbour policies, the post-coronavirus recession descends into a great depression. Inequality soars, rather than being diminished, both within our societies and between different countries.Meanwhile, in the eastern half of the continent, Hungary remains a dictatorship, with Viktor Orbán’s temporary emergency powers mysteriously becoming permanent. Poland, where the governing party is currently, grotesquely, insisting on carrying out a presidential election entirely by postal ballot that cannot possibly be free and fair, follows down the Hungarian path. The EU, no longer a community of democracies, and torn along both its north-south and east-west axes, gradually weakens and disintegrates. Left to their own devices, its member states fail to provide adequate job prospects, social security and an ecologically sustainable future for their younger citizens. And so, as already shockingly foreshadowed in our poll, they turn to authoritarian solutions. Europe looks ever less to the US, ever more to China.Come 2030 we probably won’t have either this hell or that heaven, just some version of our usual human purgatory. But which variant we come closer to is entirely up to us: to Americans and Chinese, Russians, Indians and Brazilians, of course, but in Europe, it’s mainly up to us Europeans – including the post-Brexit British of course, who are still Europeans, whether they like it or not.That’s why, on the website that presents our survey results, we’ve also set up a self-interview facility for anyone with 10 minutes to spare to tell us your best and worst European moments, and your hopes for Europe in 2030. Thus far, the fall of the Berlin Wall has been the most widely mentioned formative moment and Brexit the top-scoring worst moment. But maybe this coronavirus moment will overtake them both.

This is not a political issue.”She said the union was particularly concerned about the mental health and anxiety issues brought to its attention by students in “overwhelming” numbers.The lack of a reference to the Leaving Cert exams in the Government’s roadmap for reopening society published on Friday prompted fresh uncertainty at the weekend over whether they would go ahead.A department spokesman said this roadmap was a general guide rather than a detailed plan and no significance should be read into the fact that the exams were not referenced.In all, the union received more than 28,000 responses, including those from teachers, parents and students in other school years After these were removed and all results analysed, almost 23,694 were deemed valid.Meanwhile, a planning

and discussed them in side-meetings with the Department of Education.Earlier on Wednesday, Minister for Education Joe McHugh thanked represenstatives of groups for teachers, schools and parents who took part in a confidential advisory group meeting.“Discussions here today will assist in making decisions regarding arrangements for the Leaving Certificate that have students’ best interests at

Testing is no longer confined to those in at-risk groups and will now include those who have a cough, fever or shortness of breath.The decision to broaden the criteria was made by the National Public Health Emergency Team, who announced the deaths of another 23 patients at its briefing on Tuesday. There have now been 1,339 Covid-19 related deaths in the Republic. The total number of cases stands at 21,983.The Irish College of General Practitioners said it welcomed the widening of the testing criteria.“This is a necessary step as restrictions are easing, “ said Dr Mary Favier, president of the ICGP. “We are increasingly confident the systems the HSE have put in place will be able to accommodate and manage the ramping up in the number of tests performed each week.“As we increase the number of tests, it is critically important that contact tracing is timely and appropriately organised in order to deal with the anticipated rise. If a test result is positive, Public Health must ensure they quickly trace that person’s contacts so that we are then managing the ongoing spread of the disease.”Timeline of testing criteriaFrom mid-March, just one symptom was necessary to become eligible for a test. Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan said around 20,000 people a day had been seeking a test at the time and acknowledged that the net may have been cast too widely “in good faith’’. Changes to the testing criteria were made in late March and those with symptoms of the disease also had to belong to one of several priority groups, such as healthcare workers, close contacts of a confirmed case, pregnant women or those suffering from some chronic conditions in order to qualify for testing.Since late April, the testing criteria were slightly relaxed, with one symptom plus membership of a priority group making someone eligible for testing.

But Fianna Fáil spokesman Marc MacSharry said a task force was needed for the sector “with a direct line to Cabinet” and should include publicans, hoteliers and restaurateurs. Social Democrats TD Catherine Murphy said it must also represent employees.Mr MacSharry criticised Government measures to support businesses as “one-size-fits-all” and “not worth the paper they were written on” and he called for hotels to be allowed to open in June rather than July as planned. The Dáil was debating the impact of the pandemic on the tourism and hospitality sector.Sinn Féin’s David Cullinane asked if the Government was taking seriously comments by Minister for Health Simon Harris about the possibility of a new bank holiday towards the end of the year.Mr Cullinane said bank holiday weekends were valuable to the tourism sector.Mr Griffin said that an additional bank holiday “at the tail end of the year” would have economic benefits.He also backed calls by businesses and TDs for a zero Vat rate to be applied to the tourism and hospitality sector even though he does not have the power to implement the provision.He acknowledged that “while it is a matter for the Department of Finance primarily certainly my view in the current context the zero percent Vat rate would be the appropriate rate for the industry”. He said it would be much needed for the sector to recover.Mr Griffin said tourism accounted for 11 per cent of employment in the State, supporting 260,000 jobs and international tourists last year spent more than €5 billion in Ireland compared to €2.4 billion by Irish residents.Green Party TD Malcolm Noonan said it was time to reverse the disproportionate spend of €5 billion on foreign holidays compared to €2 billion on domestic holidays.The Minister said Covid-19 had affected travel and tourism like no other event in history.”He added that many tourism businesses have now written off 2020 completely and some may not reopen until 2021. “Others may go out of business and never reopen. It is likely to take years to recover business to anything like 2019 levels.”Independent TD Mattie McGrath highlighted education tourism and said schools providing English language teaching to international students were in limbo.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4246775.1588790632!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brussels becomes increasingly jaded with uk s brexit drama","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe  EU’s request for an  office in Northern Ireland is a technical issue unnecessarily politicised by Britain. Photograph: John ThysThere’s one word no one wants to hear in Brussels: Brexit. Profound weariness has set in in the European Union capital towards Britain’s project, even as talks stall to try to find an agreement to avoid a damaging lurch to default trade terms at the end of the year.There’s a sense of deja vu to the rows and speculation in the British press. Lately, the talk has returned to the idea of a “Canada-style deal”, with gossip that British negotiators could demand a copy of the bespoke arrangement tailored to the specifics of the transatlantic trade relationship that took seven years to negotiate.“I’ve heard talk about a Canadian-style deal for a long time. In fact I think it generated a lot of internal debate in the British government around 2017,” trade commissioner Phil Hogan wearily told The  when asked about the idea. “It continues to be an issue.”Part of the jadedness is because the EU is busy dealing with the biggest economic shock in its history and the worst pandemic in a century. These are challenges nobody wanted. Brexit, on the other hand, was voluntary.Britain chose disruption, and much of the angst and delay associated with this is due to the fact that the government rushed into it without working out the details of what the point of it was in advance.London’s negotiators seem to have adjusted little to the post-Covid reality. Even as talks were delayed and moved to videoconference due to the pandemic, officials refused to countenance even the idea of extending the current transition period to allow more time for talks.Blast from past“It’s exceptional. Never in the history for such important negotiations with any third country, have we been under such time pressure,” an exasperated chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said after the last round concluded without progress in the most contentious areas.Tuesday’s headline in the Financial Times – “Northern Ireland tensions threaten to derail Brexit long-term EU-UK deal” – was greeted as a blast from the past.This new rehearsal of the old theme relates to the EU’s request to set up an office in the North to work with local officials as they implement the complex new arrangements agreed in the withdrawal deal last year to avoid a hard border on the island.London recently started briefing that such an office would be isive, and dropping dark warnings about the Belfast Agreement, despite its diplomatic service having agreed to the idea last year.Until the talk of sovereignty from Westminster, it was a non-issue in the North itself. This is a carbon copy of events that led to the ditching of the so-called backstop, which only became a topic of contention after Conservative Party politicians began talking about it as “annexation”, giving unionists little choice but to oppose it.“I’m not aware that anyone in Northern Ireland of any persuasion was getting exercised about the EU office,” SDLP Assembly member Matthew O’Toole told The . “It was not a battleground in NI before the UK government started publicly suggesting it was unacceptable.”‘Territory question’It’s common for international organisations to have global offices, whether the United Nations or the OECD. The EU has over 129 – including, until Brexit became a reality at the end of January, one in Belfast. Even Northern Ireland itself has “Invest NI” offices in Brussels, Dusseldorf, Dubai, Manchester and Dubai. The North has long had bespoke diplomatic arrangements: it has its own office in the United States, the Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington DC, which works there to promote “political, economic, educational, and cultural” links.\u0026nbsp“It’s not a territory question, because not even embassies count as territory, even though they are sometimes wrongly portrayed that way in the movies,” said Joris Larik, an expert in EU external relations at Leiden University. “Imagine it was the other way around,” Larik mused. “Imagine the UK wanted a technical office in Rotterdam or Hamburg or in an important EU member state that they do a lot of trade with, to help out with all the paperwork that is coming their way. I don’t think that would make the headlines, I just can’t imagine anybody would be interested in that. It’s an uninteresting piece of news.”For the EU, this is another example of a technical issue becoming unnecessarily politicised by Britain, and it’s increasingly a problem when it comes to something that agreement hinges on: trust.“There are increasing worries on the EU side that the British government isn’t really 100 per cent serious a1bout implementing this . . . and then if you can’t even have an office . . .” Larik trailed off. “The Achilles’ heel of the Northern Ireland protocol is that it relies on the UK to implement it.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph:   Michael SohnPOOLAFP via Getty Images Chancellor Angela Merkel has presented a second wave of measures to loosen Germany’s Covid-19 lockdown, including an emergency brake to reimpose restrictions if new outbreaks occur.After a heated video conference, Dr Merkel and 16 federal leaders agreed to open all shops and schools as well as most of the hospitality sector, depending on adherence to hygiene rules for disinfection and distancing. People from two separate households will be allowed meet, while one contact person can visit care home residents. “We have the very first phase of the pandemic behind us.” said Dr Merkel at a press conference following a video conference. But she warned that “huge challenges” \u0026nbsplie ahead, as Germans learn to live with the virus while reopening sections of the economy.“We were led by the thought that it’s better to move ahead and give a perspective,” she added “than not to move forward at all.”Germany began to roll back lockdown measures on April 20th, a process that has been as unco-ordinated as the imposition of restrictions. Federal states, largely responsible for public health, face different levels of infection. They are also facing pressure from different, dominant industries – from automotive to tourism – to restart an economy already facing its deepest ever recession.The balancing act between economic interests and public health saw Dr Merkel among the more cautious voices in Wednesday’s talks. Two weeks ago she warned federal states were proceeding “too hastily” with loosening measures. On Wednesday she insisted on an emergency instrument to reimpose restrictions on any county or city that registers more than 50 new, serious Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people in seven consecutive days.“For me it was decisive . . . to have the means, if something happens and infections rise, to have an emergency measure so we don’t have to close an entire federal state,” said Dr Merkel.On Tuesday the southern state of Bavaria, badly hit by the outbreak, said it had Covid-19 “under control” – irritating virologists and politicians in other federal states.Pressed on this, Dr Merkel said the outbreak was “more or less” under control, allowing a more “courageous” strategy with emergency measures. Everything now depended “more than ever”, she added, on people behaving sensibly. Bavarian state premier Markus Söder said the new rules were a “balancing act . . . between allowing freedom while offering security”.So far Germany has about 166,000 registered Covid-19 cases and about 7,000 deaths, an average of 199 cases per 100,000. Average daily new infections have dropped from 6,000 in April to 900 now.On Tuesday Prof Lothar Wieler, head of the Robert Koch Institute for disease control, said he assumed “there will be a second and third wave of infection”.Despite considerable progress, he said the number of deaths was “still high” and Germany was working to increase further testing capacities. Germany is running 142,000 tests daily in 132 laboratories. Of 2.4 million tests in Germany to date, 7.2 per cent have been positive. \u0026nbsp Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"britain criticised around world dither delay coronavirus response","story":"It began as background mutterings, but it has now become a chorus. As the number of fatalities has grown, other countries have looked on in stunned disbelief at what they judge to be delays, missteps and complacency in the UK\u0027s response to the growing threat posed by coronavirus.And with the British death toll reaching almost 30,000 – the highest in Europe – that criticism is now being voiced by newspapers and commentators around the world.One of the most damning assessments came in The Sydney Morning Herald at the weekend, when Australia\u0027s oldest newspaper published a long read headlined \u0027Biggest failure in a generation\u0027: Where did Britain go wrong?’It highlighted the case of 53-year-old consultant urologist Abdul Chowdhury who, three weeks before his death from Covid-19, had urged Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, to make sure every health worker in Britain was given personal protective equipment (PPE), and whose son Intisar subsequently went on air to ask Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, for an apology.For the Herald, Intisar Chowdhury spoke on behalf of many who think Britain\u0027s response to the crisis has suffered from a series of deadly mistakes and miscalculations.In common with several other international critics, the paper focused on four main failings by the UK: the lack of PPE for healthcare workers, the repeated delays in implementing a lockdown, a bungled test and tracing regime, and the failure to protect vulnerable care home residents from the ravages of the virus.Dr Richard Horton, editor in chief of The Lancet medical journal, told the Herald in a phrase the paper would use for its headline: The handling of the Covid-19 crisis in the UK is the most serious science policy failure in a generation.The Herald contrasted border closures in Australia and New Zealand with Britain\u0027s open-door policy, with restrictions on people flying in from Wuhan imposed only briefly and those passengers still arriving under no obligation to self-isolate.Mike Rann, a former Australian high commissioner to Britain, told the newspaper that the UK made crucial mistakes at a time when they had the most damaging impact. The earliest stages were handled negligently. A shambles of mixed messaging, poor organisation and a complacent attitude that what was happening in Italy wouldn\u0027t happen here, he said.The decision taken on March 12 to abandon mass testing has also been questioned, with the Herald and others suggesting this meant the Government could only guess who was infected with the virus and how it was behaving, meaning the extent of its spread would not become obvious until hospitals began to fill with seriously ill patients.Across the Atlantic, similar questions are being asked.CNN this week broadcast a three-minute package asking what went wrong with the UK\u0027s initial handling of the virus, showing footage of packed Tube trains from the period before a lockdown was implemented, along with flashbacks to early Government briefings when the concept of Britain acquiring herd immunity guided its thinking.The New Yorker Magazine was even more forthright in its criticism – just as it has been of the Trump administration\u0027s response:In the above article published on Tuesday, it characterised Britain\u0027s handling of the pandemic as a curious mixture of superiority and fatalism... which has been slow and calamitous.The magazine pointed out that Britain has an internationally respected public health apparatus and that, in October 2016, the UK Government\u0027s Exercise Cygnus had shown how a global influenza pandemic would overwhelm the nation\u0027s health system and ravage the economy.Despite this, it says British officials dithered in the face of reports of a new coronavirus coming out of China and continued to hesitate as the virus tore through northern Italy, just at the point lessons needed to be learnt – and quickly.The British Government\u0027s short-lived adherence to the herd immunity theory was also criticised in Turkey, where the state-run Anadolu news agency published an op-ed by a researcher in international politics at Istanbul University suggesting that this distracted and prevented the UK Government from taking necessary steps at the time when they could have had significant impact on stemming the spread of the virus.Separately, the Reuters news agency focused, in a special report published on Tuesday, on Britain\u0027s failure to protect the elderly and their carers.Highlighting, among others, the case of 26-year-old care home worker Sonya Kaygan, one of over 100 UK front line health workers killed by coronavirus, it pointed out that care homes struggled to get access to tests and PPE.It also suggested the elderly were put at potentially greater risk by measures to admit only the sickest for hospital treatment and to clear out as many non-acute patients as possible from wards in order to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed.Worse was to come, said the report, with the measures needed to protect the elderly in care homes,  such as testing and supplies of PPE, simply not available.In Spain, El País last week ran a stinging editorial, describing the UK Government\u0027s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic as incomprehensible, with the article singling out Mr Johnson for criticism after he turned a deaf ear to the severity of the crisis for several weeks, to the point that he declined to attend five emergency committee meetings and instead enjoyed 12 joyful days of vacation.The initial plan of promoting herd immunity was condemned in the editorial as an uncompassionate approach and a Darwinian calculation, and it noted how the UK continued to allow planes from countries with large epidemics to land long after the risks of doing so were obvious.The editorial said Mr Johnson\u0027s Government was reckless in opting out of the joint procurement scheme for medical equipment alongside the 27 EU member states, and suggested Brexit chickens are coming home to roost as the NHS suffers personnel problems due to the Government\u0027s lack of interest in retaining European health workers.Everything points to Johnson choosing to disguise the economic and social costs of his hard Brexit with the even harder blows from the multiple crisis the pandemic is already causing, the article concluded.More from NewsMore from

hole earth 1000 light years away astronomers find","story":"The closest black hole to Earth is only 1,000 light years away, astronomers have discovered, as they reveal its stars are visible to the naked eye on a clear night sky.Located in a system called HR 6819, in the constellation Telescopium, the hole is so close to our planet that its stars can be seen from the southern hemisphere without binoculars.Although the black hole itself is invisible, it has two bright accompanying stars, making the “triple system” appear as a single bright star through a telescope.Experts previously believed that only two stars were present in the system because of the way it emitted light.However, astronomers at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) have found evidence of the invisible object by tracking its two companion stars using a 2.2 metre telescope.Analysis of their observations showed that one of the two visible stars orbits an unseen object every 40 days, while the second star keeps a significant distance.The research team were able to detect the previously unknown hole and calculate its mass by studying the orbit of the star in the inner pair within the system.The discovery of the hole in HR 6819 makes it one of the first stellar-mass black holes that does not interact violently with its environment, meaning it appears truly black.Black holes are objects which are usually formed from the gravitational collapse of a massive star.Experts believe the triple system could lead to more similar objects being found in the future, with only a couple dozen black holes observed within our galaxy to date.Dr Thomas Rivinius, the study leader and scientist at the ESO, a European astronomy organisation based in Germany, said: “This system contains the nearest black hole to Earth that we know of. An invisible object with a mass at least four times that of the sun can only be a black hole.”“There must be hundreds of millions of black holes out there, but we know about only very few. Knowing what to look for should put us in a better position to find them.”The new work, published in the journal Astronomy \u0026amp Astrophysics, is based on data collected using telescopes at ESO\u0027s La Silla Observatory in Chile.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scientists discover oldest known example squid like creature","story":"Scientists believe they have discovered the oldest known example of a squid-like creature attacking its prey, found in a fossil dating back almost 200 million years.The fossil was found on the Jurassic coast in Dorset in the 19th century and is currently kept within the collections of the British Geological Survey in Nottingham.New analysis suggests it shows a creature, identified by researchers as a Clarkeiteuthis montefiorei, with a herring-like fish called Dorsetichthys bechei in its jaws.Researchers say the position of the creature\u0027s arms, alongside the body of the fish, point to it not being a quirk of fossilisation but instead the recording of an event.They believe it dates from the Sinemurian period - between 190 and 199 million years ago - meaning it predates any previously recorded similar sample by more than 10 million years.Professor Malcolm Hart, emeritus professor at the University of Plymouth, said: Since the 19th century, the Blue Lias and Charmouth Mudstone formations of the Dorset coast have provided large numbers of important body fossils that inform our knowledge of coleoid palaeontology.In many of these mudstones, specimens of palaeobiological significance have been found, especially those with the arms and hooks with which the living animals caught their prey.This, however, is a most unusual if not extraordinary fossil as predation events are only very occasionally found in the geological record.It points to a particularly violent attack which ultimately appears to have caused the death, and subsequent preservation, of both animals.The research was led by the University of Plymouth and involved the University of Kansas, as well as Dorset-based company The Forge Fossils.In the analysis, the authors say the fossilised remains indicate a brutal incident in which the head bones of the fish were crushed by its attacker.They believe the fish may have been too large for the squid-like creature, or became stuck in its jaws - leaving the deceased pair settling to the seafloor where they were preserved.Or, the Clarkeiteuthis may have taken its prey to the seafloor to avoid the possibility of being attacked by another predator - suffocating as it entered waters low in oxygen.The paper has been accepted for publication in Proceedings of the Geologists\u0027 Association.It will also be presented as part of Sharing Geoscience Online, a virtual alternative to the tradition general assembly held each year by the European Geosciences Union.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"swedens health agency pressure two day self isolation guidance","story":"Sweden\u0027s public health agency is under pressure to change its controversial recommendation that people can leave self-isolation after just two days if they are not symptoms, with top researchers in the country calling for it to move closer to World Health Organisation guidelines.Sweden has not imposed the kind of extraordinary lockdowns seen elsewhere in Europe, instead opting for an approach based on the principle of responsibility.It has allowed schools for under-16s, cafes, bars, restaurants and businesses to stay open while urging people and businesses to respect social distancing guidelines.If you feel unwell with cold symptoms, cough or fever, you should try to avoid contact with other people, the guidelines from the Public Health Agency of Sweden read. Do not return to work or school for at least two days after you have recovered.The two-day self-isolation period is built on the agency\u0027s longstanding position that asymptomatic transmission is not a significant factor in the spread of coronavirus, and falls far short of that recommended by the World Health Organisation, which says people should self-isolate for 14 days.I agree more with the WHO\u0027s recommendations, Lennart Svensson, a professor in molecular virology at Sweden\u0027s Karolinska Institutet medical university, told the Dagens Nyheter newspaper on Wednesday.We know that you can secrete the virus more than 48 hours after you have last had symptoms. I think it is better to be over-cautious than to be on the edge, because then you risk outbreaks of the elderly care homes, for instance.Johan Carlson, the agency\u0027s director general, admitted to the newspaper that the agency had been considering changing the recommendation.We are carrying on a discussion about this all the time, but we have yet to make our move, he said, adding that the decision was quite complicated as many of those self-isolating probably did not have the virus.Karin Tegmark Wisell, Head of the Public Health Authority\u0027s unit for infection prevention diagnostics, told the newspaper that the recommendation might be changed as the country steps up the level of coronavirus testing.If we start testing more now, there may be reasons to tweak this, she said.Swedish officials on Wednesday said the country was nearing 3,000 deaths from Covid-19.We are starting to near 3,000 deceased, a horrifyingly large number, state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell told a press conference.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"taiwanese official reveals china suspected human human transmission","story":"One of the first foreign infectious disease experts to gain access to the Chinese city of Wuhan – the original epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak – was told by a Beijing official on January 13 that “limited human to human transmission cannot be excluded.”The statement made to Chuang Yin-ching, a senior official working for Taiwan’s Centres for Disease Control, is thought to be the earliest acknowledgement that the pandemic which has now wreaked havoc across the world was already underway. In an exclusive interview with The , Mr Chuang’s provides a fascinating window into the confusion on the ground and tensions between health officials that may have allowed the disease to spread out of control in the early stages of the crisis.  He and a colleague had been permitted to visit Wuhan from January 13-15 to discuss the emerging novel coronavirus with Chinese health officers and doctors. The city of 11 million was calm, with no sense of impending disaster, and their hosts tried to invite them to dinner and to go sightseeing, but Mr Chuang said he remained in his hotel, wary of “how dangerous it was outside.”At a visit to the Jin Yin Tan hospital, he was not obliged to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) but he was also not allowed to observe patients in the so-called “dirty zone.”The seasoned professor of medicine described an extraordinary scene in a closed meeting between Chinese officials and visiting experts from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau when a senior Beijing health official stepped in to contradict his local colleague’s denial of human to human transmission of the virus. “Initially…the chairperson of the meeting, tried to deny human to human transmission but finally the person from the central government health authority said ‘why do you give an old conclusion? Now the conclusion is that limited human to human transmission cannot be excluded’,” said Mr Chuang. “For me that was very important information.”The clash between the unnamed Beijing expert and the conclusions of Wuhan health officials was grounded in a case study of an unexplained but important family cluster of a husband and wife.The Chinese health authorities told their guests there were 41 cases, 28 of them associated with the Huanan seafood market that they had closed down on January 1. “The husband worked in the Huanan seafood market but unfortunately his wife is somewhat disabled, so the possibility of her getting infected directly from this market was quite low,” explained Mr Chuang.“That meant there were only two possibilities – she got the disease from her husband or... she got the disease from something her husband brought back to the home.”In Mr Chuang’s mind, there was no doubt by this point that humans were infecting humans. He also doubted the accuracy of just 41 cases and received no response to his questions about why 13 infections could not be traced to the seafood market. His testimony corroborates an Associated Press story in April, based on internal documents, that top Chinese officials had determined they were facing a pandemic from a new coronavirus six days before warning the public. Some 3,000 people are believed to have been infected during the week of silence. Public confirmation of human to human transmission of a mysterious SARS-like virus did not emerge from the Chinese health ministry until January 19, just as the country was entering its busiest annual travel period of the year, when millions board trains and planes for the Lunar New Year holidays. The World Health Organisation, which sent a delegation to Wuhan on January 20-21, issued a statement on January 22 saying human to human transmission is taking place in Wuhan.”It added: “More analysis of the epidemiological data is needed to understand the full extent of human-to-human transmission.”The WHO has hit back at charges from Donald Trump, the US president, that it “minimised the threat very strongly,” pointing to technical guidance notes sent to health leaders on January 10 and 11 urging them be alert to any evidence of sustained human to human transmission and to take stringent precautions. On January 14, Maria Van Kerkove, the acting head of the WHO emerging diseases unit, told a Geneva press conference that the health body was preparing for the possibility of a wider outbreak as information indicated “it is possible that there is limited human-to-human transmission, potentially among families.”However, the global health body appeared to walk back the assertion in a tweet on the same day, where it said: “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China.”Mr Chuang showed no such ambivalence when he returned to his superiors in Taipei that week, confirming their fears that the highly infectious disease was already spreading between people. Taiwan’s CDC announced their findings at a press conference on January 16 and activated a Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC) to oversee a strict, stage-by-stage, epidemic response plan. To date, Taiwan has only seen 439 cases and six deaths. Mr Chuang still has lingering doubts about how much his Chinese counterparts knew or were willing to tell him. As they parted, “they said a phrase in Chinese…’when the spring comes and the flower is open’ after this outbreak we can have a meeting in Wuhan or Taipei about this epidemic,” he said.  “So obviously they hoped they could control the outbreak, but I don’t know if it is true or not.”   Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityMore from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/03/TELEMMGLPICT000000614099_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqA7OJWNt54phcP-0lBJzIYez7fhUBtWYECswaymtAuw4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"ve day vital opportunity engage next generation remembrance","story":"\u0026#39The unique sense of appreciation for the past can come from something as simple as unearthing old photographs, or recognising a familiar name on a memorial\u0026#39For those of us who are of an age to recall it, VE Day was a momentous occasion which still stands out vividly in our memories. As we mark its 75th anniversary, we reflect on the courage and sacrifice of those who served in the Second World War, and the enormous human cost of the peace and liberty we have enjoyed since the victory in 1945. We offer these men and women from across the Commonwealth our eternal gratitude. Throughout my 50 years as president of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), I have seen at first-hand the dedication and passion that has been channelled into ensuring the legacy of the fallen is not lost. Whether through the preservation of memorials or the diligent gathering of records of those who fought, we are ensuring people have the chance to reflect, learn and understand the scale of the conflicts. The anniversary of VE Day, along with that of the Normandy landings last year, and the centenary of the Great War in 2018, has rightly shone a spotlight on the bravery of service personnel, and provoked an outpouring of public admiration. These milestones provide an invaluable opportunity to put human faces to the names and numbers in our history books, and to reaffirm our commitment to remembrance. Most crucially, they allow us to educate our young people on the importance of the continuing remembrance of the war dead, so that we can ensure such atrocities never happen again. The unique sense of appreciation for the past can come from something as simple as unearthing old photographs, or recognising a familiar name on a memorial or, indeed, within the extensive, digital database of war records – how far we have come since the original, paper archives! And who could fail to be inspired by the spirit and sense of duty of those soldiers who are still with us today? By Mr Harry Billinge, the Normandy veteran campaigning to commemorate his fallen comrades? Or by Captain Tom Moore – now an honorary Colonel – who has raised a staggering amount for the NHS, in the days before his 100th birthday? But with each passing year, the ranks of those with a personal connection to the war are shrinking. That is why it is vital that we pass that baton of remembrance on to the next generation, and do all we can to ensure the voices and experiences of those who fought are not lost, or forgotten. Through my work with the CWGC, it has been my privilege to visit war cemeteries all over the world, to pay my respects. These memorials are, in many cases, the last physical reminders of the world wars, and it is a testament to the CWGC team that so many remain, with sites in 23,000 locations in 153 countries. It is thanks to their efforts that people will have the chance to visit them for centuries to come. But the task of engaging the next generation goes much further than the physical headstones and cenotaphs. With work due to begin – although postponed, given the current situation – on the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme in France, the CWGC will be creating new ways to explore the site while it undergoes much needed maintenance. Through an interactive exhibition utilising mobile devices and a walking trail, keen historians of all ages will be able to learn about the memorial and the battle, while engaging with the stories of those who fought.As the act of remembrance of the world wars enters the digital age, it is crucial that the spirit of reconciliation is not forgotten. As British and German soldiers exchanged fire, each did their duty, and so it is our duty to uphold the friendship that seemed impossible within living memory, and to come together as allies in remembrance of our shared past and our shared losses.As well as VE Day and VJ Day, 2020 marks 75 years since the bombing of Dresden. As patron of the Dresden Trust, which has worked to heal the relationship between Britain and Saxony, and as the son of an RAF officer who lost his life during the Second World War, I joined hands on February 13 this year with the president of Germany in a symbolic human chain. We stood together in the light of the Frauenkirche – badly damaged in 1945, and today topped by a golden orb and cross a gift from the British, to the people of Dresden. On the anniversary of VE Day, we celebrate peace and we pay tribute to the men and women who died for it. But let us also reflect on the lessons learned and the relationships built, in order to ensure a lasting legacy of the dead for the next 100 years, and beyond.The Duke of Kent is president of the Commonwealth War Graves CommissionProfessor Neil Ferguson\u0026#39s defence for breaking lockdown rules raises questions over his adviceThreats to publish intimate pictures could become a criminal offence as early as this summerGovernment urged to clarify coronavirus immunity advice after Neil Ferguson claimOnline victims of fraud and abuse are turned away by police despite compelling evidence, study findsComment: Sunak\u0026#39s mission is to save us fromPriti Patel seeks French backing for plan to return Channel migrants to France to end people traffickingCoronavirus latest news: Official UK death toll rises to 30,076 as \u0026#39stay at home\u0026#39 message to end this weekend\u0026#39They wanted to take us sight seeing.

The irightsndustry is worth $1.5 trillion (£1.2 trillion) a year – about half the size of the UK’s entire annual economic output. Most of those clothes are made in poor countries and bought in rich ones. Low prices have been key.Some retailers have sought to share the unprecedented economic pain of Covid-19 with their suppliers. Sweden’s H\u0026ampM took the early lead, saying it would honour all existing contracts for goods ordered. Zara owner, Spanish giant Inditex, followed suit with a similar pledge.What was the Rana Plaza disaster and why did it happen?Others, such as\u0026nbspPrimark, took a hard-line approach, cancelling hundreds of millions of pounds of orders before partially backtracking in the face of a surge of bad publicity. UK retailer Next agreed this week to honour some of its orders.Asda, owned by US retail giant Walmart, is enjoying a bumper period of trade, but decided to pay its suppliers half for finished garments and 30 per cent for unfinished ones. It’s since softened some of its demands.Then there are the worst offenders who are still refusing to budge.Philip Green’s Arcadia Group, which owns brands including Dorothy Perkins, Topshop, and Miss Selfridge, has been among them. Uddin’s company, Denim Expert, received terse letters in March and April, stating bluntly that orders for hundreds of thousands of pieces of clothing had been cancelled with immediate effect.Items already shipped would be subject to a 30 per cent discount, Arcadia said, in a few lines of text that more than wiped out Uddin’s mark-up of between 5 and 10 per cent.“You can make better margins,” he says. “But not if you pay workers properly and do things sustainably, as we do.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is owned by retail billionaire Philip Day and operates more than 1,000 stores across the UK.In March, EWM cancelled orders with Uddin’s company for tens of thousands of items and demanded 70 per cent discounts on millions of pounds worth of goods that had already been made, handing a huge loss to suppliers.These orders were not for seasonal summer items that Peacocks could not sell, but for standard lines of jeans that EWM did not want to have to pay money to store in warehouses. Even in the current circumstances, such huge reductions were unheard of.With no buyer for his jeans and little room for storage,\u0026nbspUddin\u0026nbspfears a significant proportion of the fruits of his workers’ labour will end up in landfill. “It’s a huge environmental problem,” he says\u0026nbspwhen\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspspoke to him on International Workers’ Day.Garment industry workers, already among the most precarious in the world, face destitution with no social security safety net.Uddin\u0026nbspprides himself on treating workers ethically and with respect. So far, he has continued to pay his 2,000 mostly young, female employees so that they in turn can continue to feed the thousands more mouths who depend on their modest incomes. Others have not been able to, or have chosen not to, do so. And time is fast running out.The apparel business runs on small margins and lots of credit. As orders are cancelled and banks begin to call in their loans a humanitarian disaster that is hitting Bangladesh at a particularly poignant time.It’s Ramadan, the holy month in which Muslims – including\u0026nbspUddin’s\u0026nbsp2,000 staff – devote themselves to prayer, fasting and charitable deeds.Seven years ago this month, emergency workers were trawling through the rubble of\u0026nbspRana\u0026nbspPlaza, an unsafe and poorly maintained garment factory in Dhaka that collapsed, crushing 1,137 people to death. In early May 2013, weeks after the initial collapse, the search was finally called off and the industry vowed, “never again”.EWM is owned by Philip Day, a fashion billionaire who worked his way up from a childhood on a Stockport council estate to build an estimated £1.2bn fortune. He owns a castle in Carlisle, officially lives in Switzerland and spends a lot of his time in Dubai, where his acquisition company Spectre is registered. He reportedly bought his first helicopter from Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley.Like Ashley and Green, Day has been phenomenally successful in building a huge retail operation. It boasts more than 1,000 stores and over 25,000 staff. While his profile may be lower, his methods are similarly controversial.Companies who have not committed to honouring contracts for existing ordersHis reputation for buying up struggling high street names and turning them around has landed him with a reputation\u0026nbspas a saviour of Britain’s ailing high streets. However, some view him more of an asset stripper, who gets hold of failing brands while using insolvency laws to ensure that suppliers are left with nothing.His takeover of Jaeger attracted criticism from suppliers and some observers. With the high-end fashion brand failing, he purchased the brand name but did not pay for the company’s assets. When the company fell into administration shortly afterwards, suppliers who had already handed over stock to Jaeger received just 2p for every pound they were owed.Critics suggest he is using similar “financial engineering” to turn a profit from struggling Bonmarche, the clothing retailer Peacocks bought for just £5.7m last year which then went into administration. A spokesperson for EWM said Mr Day lost out financially from the administration.Suppliers in Bangladesh and beyond now allege that they too are receiving unfair treatment from Mr Day’s company.“I’ve been told by Peacocks the goods are cancelled,” says Uddin. “We told them that we have bought raw materials from the factory but they are not replying to our emails. We get automated responses. They just don’t care.”We do not want charity. We just want companies to pay their bills and respect their contractsArcadia is little better, says Uddin. “They have cancelled around $2.5m of orders. This will be a disaster for me and my workers.”A spokesperson for Peacocks said the company contacted suppliers as soon as possible to provide them with options once it was clear high streets were seeing a downturn in sales. “This was an essential step as, otherwise we would be taking delivery of stock that we simply could not sell,” the company said. “We have since entered negotiations with suppliers inidually, with the options tailored to the inidual suppliers.”Arcadia did not respond to requests for comment.Across Bangladesh, companies have cancelled an estimated $3.5bn of orders. For a country that generates the majority\u0026nbspof its export income from clothing sales, this could spell disaster.Bangladeshi factory owners like Uddin are now effectively being asked to subsidise Philip Green, the former king of British retail, and his apparent heir, Philip Day.Seven years after Rana Plaza, Uddin, like many manufacturers in the trade, feels he is treated with little\u0026nbspmore respect than he was\u0026nbspback then.“There was no negotiation, no discussion, no partnership or respect. No co-ordination. Nothing. You accept the discount or take the goods. How can I take the goods when they’re already in a UK port?” he asks.“We have bought the raw materials, we have produced the garments, we have invested the money and we will not be able to survive.“We will\u0026nbspliterally die. It will be impossible for us to handle this. Our workers will be suffering a\u0026nbsplot. I have no words to express what it will do to us.”“The goods are ready. They should take the goods. If they have a problem they can wait for a month or for 45 days. There should be some discussion but they just sent an email saying that the orders are cancelled. How is this possible?”Since February, buyers for Uddin’s company have cancelled around $10.5m\u0026nbspof orders – a big chunk of his annual turnover. Globally, the Workers’ Rights Consortium estimated that $24bn\u0026nbspof orders have been cancelled –\u0026nbspthough this has likely reduced as some brands have made new commitments in the face of a wave of bad publicity.Global clothing buyers have made big claims in recent years to have cleaned up their act.Yet, even before the coronavirus hit demand, increased pressure to cut prices had already seen wages in the sector fall 15 per cent. In the past two months, an estimated 60 million low-paid garment industry workers have had their livelihoods put at risk as major brands and retailers have sought to dump the financial burden of the crisis on those further down the supply chain.EWM says it had no choice but to demand discounts. Its latest accounts published in December showed that, unlike many retailers, it had no bank debt and had turned a healthy profit. It decided not to pay a idend to shareholders as it wanted to pump money into making more acquisitions.Uddin believes the company is trying to take advantage of the coronavirus\u0026nbspcrisis to obtain massive discount.Peacocks says it gave suppliers three options: They could keep hold of the stock and sell it locally they could accept a large discount or they could be paid for it when\u0026nbspPeacocks eventually took delivery and sold the stock to consumers.These aren’t really options at all, according to Uddin. Like most garment manufacturers, he borrowed the money to make the jeans (which were ordered back in August last year). He can’t wait for Peacocks to potentially sell them in a year’s time before payment. His workers need wages now.“My workers’ lives are under threat because we are an export company,” he says. “We only get the money when we complete the export. If we don’t export we don’t get the money.”Inditex, which owns Zara, has by contrast, used its strong pile of cash to honour contracts with suppliers.An immediate solution is needed to prevent millions of impoverished workers becoming destitute, says the Workers’ Rights Consortium.The power relationship between buyers and suppliers in the fashion industry is among the most unequal of any sector. Contracts reflect that inequality with buyers dictating whatever terms suit them. Legal remedies are too costly and take too much time, as buyers are well aware.There are signs that bad publicity is beginning to shame retailers into action. Some companies have agreed to step in to pay wages of some workers but this amounts to only a small fraction of the orders cancelled, says Olivia Windham Stewart, a leading campaigner on the issue.Many other retailers, including John Lewis, Gap, Arcadia Asos, Sports Direct, have yet to make firm commitments.“We do not want charity,” says Uddin. “We just want companies to pay their bills and respect their contracts.”Beyond the immediate crisis, the situation may only be fixed by legislation in wealthy countries forcing companies to take responsibility for their supply chains. At present, they remain almost entirely unaccountable.Last year, the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee recommended that the UK government should legally require fashion retailers to take responsibility for environmental and human rights issues in their supply chains.The government rejected all of the recommendations.But change may finally be coming. Last week, the EU commissioner for justice announced the Commission would introduce “mandatory corporate environmental and human rights due diligence” across all sectors. Perhaps, says Olivia Windham Stewart, the UK will have to follow suit.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Is it too expensive? What reforms should the government be looking at? Ben Chu assesses the evidenceThe government’s coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has, on the face of it, been a stand out success.So far, according to HMRC, some 800,000 businesses have successfully tapped the new subsidy programme, putting 6.3 million of their employees, around a fifth of the entire UK labour force, on furlough.Beware a second wave of job losses, not just the virusSharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt’s reasonable to assume that\u0026nbspin the absence of the scheme a large proportion of those employees would have been made redundant and the wave of joblessness currently breaking over the UK would have been significantly greater.Yet there are also now noises coming out of the Treasury suggesting that the scheme might, in some respects, have been too successful – that so many companies have accessed the support that withdrawing it could prove agonisingly difficult. The chancellor,\u0026nbspRishi Sunak, has also raised concerns over the spiralling cost of the support to the public purse.Are such fears warranted? And with the chancellor due to issue an update on the policy next week, what should the government’s next steps be when it comes to supporting both workers and firms through this crisis?The costs and the benefitsIn an interview with ITV News on Monday Mr Sunak said the furlough scheme – whereby the state picks up 80 per cent of the cost of an employees wages up to a ceiling of £2,500 a month – was potentially as expensive as funding the NHS.“That is not a sustainable situation,” he said.The estimated cost of the support extended so far is around £8bn. The scheme is currently due to expire on 30 June, but there is no cap on the number of firms who can tap it in that time. The Office for Budget Responsibility put out a scenario last month that had the scheme costing £42bn over three months.The cost of running the health service\u0026nbspfor three months is around £45bn, which is the likely basis for the chancellor’s comparison.Yet it’s a mistake to view the job subsidy as a pure public cost.If those millions of workers were unemployed instead of furloughed that would entail a much higher state welfare bill, via unemployment and other benefits.And the fact that the scheme keeps workers linked to their employers – meaning they can be put back to work rapidly when the crisis is over – should also, theoretically, be more economically efficient than redundancies and attempted re-hirings.Avoiding the cliff-edgeNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBusiness lobby groups have raised the alarm over a potential wave of redundancies when the scheme ends.The problem for many businesses is that they do not know what the state of demand for their goods and services will be in two months’ time.Many suspect that it will not be as strong as it was prior to the lockdowns. If that’s the case they may feel they need to reduce their workforce. Yet there’s a legal consultation period for making redundancies of between 30 to\u0026nbsp45 days.If the support ended\u0026nbspsuddenly at the end of June that would mean they would have to start making redundancies very soon if they wanted to have downsized their workforce by the time of the economy re-opening.Lobby groups say the government should remove this cliff\u0026nbspedge facing firms by committing now to extend the scheme past June and allowing some workers to return on a part-time basis.There’s some discussion of the government tapering down financial support\u0026nbsprather than removing it all at a stroke, such as by covering a smaller share of an employee’s wages.This, of course, would have financial implications for the Treasury.Some around Mr Sunak have, apparently, suggested that companies are in danger of becoming “addicted” to the scheme.And one of his predecessors, Norman Lamont, has argued that it might provide a “false sense of security” for people because their jobs are not likely to return after the scheme ends – that furlough is merely delaying the inevitable.Economists says the addiction analogy is inaccurate and most strongly support the broad principles of the scheme.Yet there is a concern about some of the incentives created by the scheme, such as the effective pressure on companies to furlough employees entirely to access the subsidy, rather than to merely reduce their hours.It could also conceivably discourage firms from re-opening as early as they otherwise would.The furlough scheme is also\u0026nbsplikely to prevent some workers from searching for work elsewhere, even when this might be in their own long-term interests.At a time when the economy is still in lockdown this might not represent a major economic problem. But as hiring picks up it could become one.The trade-off facing policymakers is in extending the support to protect certain firms and allowing the normal, broad, employment market incentives to operate.The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the government should try to identify sectors where many furloughed employees are less likely to\u0026nbspreturn to work as normal – citing hotels and restaurants – and act to reduce barriers to these iniduals taking alternative work.Mike Brewer of the Resolution Foundation, the think tank that originally proposed the furlough scheme, says that it was the right policy at the time it was introduced, but agrees that it needs adjusting for the next phase of the crisis.“What we need is a scheme that encourages and allows employers to adjust, encourages and allows work to happen where it can do so safely and tries to avoid millions of families seeing a huge income hit,” he says.“Doing all those is really, really hard.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, it said “more normal shopping patterns have returned” in recent weeks.In an attempt minimise the risk of spreading Covid-19, Ocado has introduced what it describes as contact-free deliveries, temperature monitoring for staff, and regular testing of frontline workers.The sales update came as Ocado prepared to face anger at its annual meeting over chief executive Tim Steiner’s £58.7m pay deal last year.Ocado isn’t the only grocer enjoying bumper sales. Consumers are making fewer trips to the shops but are spending more when they do venture out, according to data from Kantar. Grocery sales in Britain rose by 5.5 per cent year-on-year in the four weeks to 19 April, the analysts said.Ocado said it expects “the long-term shift towards online grocery to accelerate post-crisis”, but said it is unable to provide guidance for its outlook for the rest of the year due to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic.Mr Steiner said: “We are facing quite a different challenge to many, as we scale-up Ocado to play its part in feeding the nation, and as we help our clients launch and roll out their online businesses more rapidly against a backdrop of a likely long-term increase in demand for online.“Ocado remains in a strong position and, while we should be grateful that our current challenges are around growth, expansion and increased demand, we have great empathy for all who are facing different challenges at this time.“In retail, we are working with our small suppliers to make sure we pay them earlier than normal and we will work closely with any who are struggling.”Ocado’s 40 per cent sales jump added to a 10 per cent increase in the first quarter of its financial year. Established in 2000, it is now a joint venture with Marks \u0026amp Spencer after a tie-up between the two companies agreed last year.

They laid out no guidance on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) without which it is “impossible to make judgements on safe working practices”, Mr McDonald added.He called for a requirement for most businesses to produce specific Covid-19 policies for safe working that are registered with the Health and Safety Executive and publicly available.The government laid out draft proposals on Sunday including reduced use of hot-desking, staggered start times to reduce the number of people at a workplace during each shift. It also said physical screens should be used where possible workers should be kept two metres apart.Unions have strongly criticised the plans, which they say do not go far enough to protect workers who could soon go back to work after the government reviews the lockdown on Thursday.The prime minister is expected to produce a “road map” for exiting lockdown on Sunday, but Mr McDonald said the current plans have been produced without consultations with workers whose lives may be put at risk.Junior business minister Paul Scully told the Commons that it was speaking to hundreds of businesses, unions and Public Health England, with full guidelines published “in due course”.Mr McDonald said: “The proposals themselves are wholly inadequate,” adding that “crucially, worker safety was a legal right before the crisis and must not be cast aside now”.“The documents present measures to maintain safe workplaces such as hand washing and social distancing as being at the discretion of employers, when in fact\u0026nbspthey are requirements of the law.

More significantly, it offered few specifics on when many of its isions might return to normal operations or how it would make up shortfalls in the interim.As its theme parks began to be shuttered, movies could not be released and sports could be played, Disney saw total operating income drop 37 per cent to $2.4bn (£1.9bn) in the quarter ending 31 March. Parks and cruises had profit go from $1.5bn (£1.2bn)\u0026nbspin the quarter last year to $639m\u0026nbsp(£514m) this year, with a loss of about $1bn in revenue.Earnings-per-share, meanwhile, dropped to just 60 cents, a 63 per cent decline compared to the same quarter a year ago and lower than the 89 cents many forecasters expected.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThose reduced numbers were cushioned by the fact that much of the quarter played out before the crisis hit in the US, and many analysts and investors believe the worse is yet to come. The quarter, for instance, included only a few weeks of the park shutdowns in the US.And team sports, on which Disney cable network ESPN heavily relies, were not suspended until about the same time. The company currently lacks a wide range of revenue streams for the new quarter, which runs through June there is no timetable, for instance, on the reopening of US\u0026nbsptheme parks.Created with Sketch.The 25 most anticipated movies and TV shows on Disney+ Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This $100m series created by Jon Favreau is one of six originals teased by Disney for the launch of the streaming platform (with more to come in the future). It’s set between the fall of the Empire and the emergence of the First Order and follows the Mandalorian (Pedro Pascal), “a lone gunfighter in the outer reaches of the galaxy, far from the authority of the New Republic”.225 Lady and the Tramp (2019)Disney is banking on the nostalgic pull of the likes of Lady and the Tramp – and the buzz of a live-action reboot – to attract subscribers. Tessa Thompson, Justin Theroux, Sam Elliott, Ashley Jensen, Janelle Monáe and Benedict Wong voice the canines while Kiersey Clemons, Thomas Mann, Yvette Nicole Brown, Adrian Martinez and Ken Jeong all appear in human form.Another original, Encore! is led by host and executive producer Kristen Bell. In this reality series, high school students are tasked with re-creating a performance of a musical they all performed together back in the day.Speaking of high schools and musicals, Disney is reviving the franchise that propelled Zac Efron to global fame in 2006. This scripted mockumentary series is set in a fictionalised version of the (real) East High School in Salt Lake City, Utah, which served as a filming location for the original films. A (fictional) former cast member begins work as a drama teacher at the (fictional) school and decides to stage a performance of – you guessed it – High School Musical: The Musical.525 Almost all the Star Wars films you could possibly wantDisney’s making the most out of its 2012 $4bn purchase of LucasFilm by including The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and The Force Awakens on its launch catalogue.

It’s set between the fall of the Empire and the emergence of the First Order and follows the Mandalorian (Pedro Pascal), “a lone gunfighter in the outer reaches of the galaxy, far from the authority of the New Republic”.225 Lady and the Tramp (2019)Disney is banking on the nostalgic pull of the likes of Lady and the Tramp – and the buzz of a live-action reboot – to attract subscribers. Tessa Thompson, Justin Theroux, Sam Elliott, Ashley Jensen, Janelle Monáe and Benedict Wong voice the canines while Kiersey Clemons, Thomas Mann, Yvette Nicole Brown, Adrian Martinez and Ken Jeong all appear in human form.Another original, Encore! is led by host and executive producer Kristen Bell.

Enough said.“Today\u0027s not the point,” said Lloyd Greif, a veteran Los Angeles-based investment banker who closely follows Disney. “We haven\u0027t seen ugly yet. Third and fourth quarter is where the rubber will really hit the road.”Disney\u0027s executives had few answers for analysts on what they could do to stem the tide until the American entertainment economy can resume at anything close to full capacity. They pointed to few scattered revenue-drivers, such as high ratings for its ESPN documentary series\u0026nbspThe Last Dance\u0026nbspand growing subscriptions for Disney Plus, as a way of keeping dollars flowing.Instead, executives sought to paint a longer-term picture that relied on more general advantages like the trustworthiness of the Disney brand.“As someone who\u0027s been around for a while and led the company through some really tough days\u0026nbsp... I have absolute confidence we\u0027ll get through this challenging period and recover successfully,” Bob Iger, the company\u0027s executive chairman and until several months ago its chief executive, told analysts in a call.He said he thought it “quite possible” Disney\u0027s properties will now resonate with consumers more than ever. “People find comfort and inspiration in our messages of hope and optimism,” he said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWhy have share prices been rising while economies have been tanking?Mr Iger, the often-celebrated chief executive who stepped down shortly before the crisis erupted in the US\u0026nbspto focus on content, has retaken more of a public role from successor Bob Chapek as he tries to right the company and his legacy.On the call, Mr Chapek said he thought the cruise ship business, which has been at the epicentre of the coronavirus crisis, could also rebound in the long term. He said Disney\u0027s lines will be “much more resilient” than competitors and noted that “consumers trust our business to react in a responsible way to protect them”.For now, though, the numbers are bleak, and may get bleaker. Disney\u0027s film studio saw an operating income drop of about 8 per cent, to $466m\u0026nbsp(£375m), as the company was unable to release its much anticipated Mulan\u0026nbspat the end of March. That film has been postponed until the end of July. The effect of other postponed spring releases, such as Marvel picture Black Widow, will be felt in the new quarter. The movie has been postponed from May to November.There is no timetable for the playing of NBA and Major League Baseball games that drive viewership to ESPN.The earnings figures preview a potentially dramatic fall for a company that just a few months ago had an iron grip on the entertainment industry. Disney closed 2019 with all five of the highest-grossing movies in the world and more than $20bn\u0026nbsp(£16bn) in revenue for the quarter ending 31 December, a 36 per cent increase from the previous year. Parks alone generated more than $7bn\u0026nbsp(£5.6bn) in revenue and $2bn (£1.6bn) in profit.Disney was facing some challenges, including cord-cutting and a potential slowdown in theatrical revenue, before coronavirus hit. But the pandemic has slammed nearly all of its key isions.The cruise-ship and theme-park unit, which Mr\u0026nbspChapek\u0026nbspoversaw until recently, accounted for nearly 40 per cent of Disney\u0027s overall revenue last year.Though there is no timetable for the reopenings of US\u0026nbspparks, Mr\u0026nbspChapek suggested that the company would go slowly, and also not reopen if executives were not confident visitors would follow.“We would not reopen any park until we can make a positive contribution to overhead and operating-profit level,” he said.Mr Chapek did say that Shanghai Disneyland will open on Monday. He said contact tracing, social-distancing and “early detection systems” will be among the tools used to limit virus exposure. Masks will be given to staff and guests, he said.The opening will serve as a test case for potential US\u0026nbspreopenings in Florida and California, particularly on the issue of capacity. The Chinese government is mandating about 30 per cent capacity, or 24,000 of the roughly 80,000 people who visit the park daily. The first few weeks will see Disney cap the number at below even that, Mr Chapek said, as staffers work out the new protocols.Demi Lovato recalls how eating disorder impacted her on Disney showDisney heiress criticises CEO’s for furloughing staffFlorida Disney World to furlough 43,000 workersDisney has furloughed as many as 100,000 employees beginning in April. Executives have said they will accept cuts in their own compensation. Mr Chapek says he had no timetable on the furloughed employees return. The senior-executive salary cut will continue “until we see a substantive economic recovery”.Disney Plus has been a bright spot for the firm amid the pandemic, with 50 million global sign-ups as of early April. Still, the company does not expect profitability from the service for at least three years. The service is also affected by production shutdowns, limiting its ability to churn out new shows that will attract and retain subscribers.Executives said that they still planned on opening Mulan\u0026nbspin theaters at the end of July, and would have the benefit of what Mr Chapek called a “competitive movie” - Warner Bros\u0027s\u0026nbspTenet\u0026nbsp- opening the week before to see how consumers react. At that point, however, it would likely be too late to change release plans.Disney chief financial officer Christine McCarthy declined to offer definitive comment on any shareholder idend in 2020, saying only there was none planned at the moment and the company will address the matter again “in the next six months”. The company has provided a idend in recent years as its stock price has risen.Disney\u0027s share price has dropped about 10 per cent since the US\u0026nbspclosures due to coronavirus became probable the second week of March. The stock dropped 2 per cent in after-hours trading Tuesday with the earnings news.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The quiet roads, the clean air, hedgehog nirvana...Yet we know it can’t last.This week the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the main industry body, reported that the number of vehicles on our roads had reached a record 40.4 million in 2019. That’s rather more than one for everyone with a driving licence. Some 35 million of them are cars, the rest an increasing number of vans and 607,008 lorries, the highest in 30 years.Their numbers are in part boosted by the rise of online shopping (which will probably see a step change upwards after the lockdown\u0026nbsphas passed). They’re not moving much now, most of them, but they’ll be back.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesYour home is more important than you think when owning an electric carThe recent extremely weak oil price will mean cheaper oil and diesel, which won’t help the electric cause. Petrolheads have their eyes on that 6 litre twelve cylinder used Bentley Continental GT they’ve always lusted after (I’ve some sympathy there).The SMMT\u0026nbspsay that only 92,913 of the total UK “parc” as the trade calls it, are pure electric vehicles - battery-only rather than hybrids also running an internal combustion engine 0.2 per cent.Electric vehicle sales enjoyed a brief boomlet in the brief space between the Chancellor’s Budget, which pre-announced cuts in subsidies, and the lock down. Sales\u0026nbspof everything have now collapsed.What I\u0027ve learned so far about driving electric carsYet when we all go back to normal driving - statistically most likely in a black eight-year old Ford Fiesta - we will also go back to spewing out CO2 and generating vast amounts of vroomy din, but this latest global\u0026nbspshock might just persuade us of a couple of things.First, that it doesn’t have to be this way, and the electric car (and delivery van) means we can have our cake (personal mobility) and eat it (clean air, peaceful streets).Second, more abstrusely, we might consider where the next planet-wide disaster is going to come from. In fact, it was possible to see the approach of the financial crisis of 2008, the waves of war and terror, and the various pandemics of the twenty first century, including this one, and to have done something about them. There were signs and warnings.You can see where I’m heading with this can’t you? I’m sorry to be so obvious, but the climate emergency is the next disaster, except that it is already just about upon us.

However, it said “more normal shopping patterns have returned” in recent weeks.In an attempt minimise the risk of spreading Covid-19, Ocado has introduced what it describes as contact-free deliveries, temperature monitoring for staff, and regular testing of frontline workers.The sales update came as Ocado prepared to face anger at its annual meeting over chief executive Tim Steiner’s £58.7m pay deal last year.Ocado isn’t the only grocer enjoying bumper sales. Consumers are making fewer trips to the shops but are spending more when they do venture out, according to data from Kantar. Grocery sales in Britain rose by 5.5 per cent year-on-year in the four weeks to 19 April, the analysts said.Ocado said it expects “the long-term shift towards online grocery to accelerate post-crisis”, but said it is unable to provide guidance for its outlook for the rest of the year due to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic.Mr Steiner said: “We are facing quite a different challenge to many, as we scale-up Ocado to play its part in feeding the nation, and as we help our clients launch and roll out their online businesses more rapidly against a backdrop of a likely long-term increase in demand for online.“Ocado remains in a strong position and, while we should be grateful that our current challenges are around growth, expansion and increased demand, we have great empathy for all who are facing different challenges at this time.“In retail, we are working with our small suppliers to make sure we pay them earlier than normal and we will work closely with any who are struggling.”Ocado’s 40 per cent sales jump added to a 10 per cent increase in the first quarter of its financial year. Established in 2000, it is now a joint venture with Marks \u0026amp Spencer after a tie-up between the two companies agreed last year.

They laid out no guidance on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) without which it is “impossible to make judgements on safe working practices”, Mr McDonald added.He called for a requirement for most businesses to produce specific Covid-19 policies for safe working that are registered with the Health and Safety Executive and publicly available.The government laid out draft proposals on Sunday including reduced use of hot-desking, staggered start times to reduce the number of people at a workplace during each shift. It also said physical screens should be used where possible workers should be kept two metres apart.Unions have strongly criticised the plans, which they say do not go far enough to protect workers who could soon go back to work after the government reviews the lockdown on Thursday.The prime minister is expected to produce a “road map” for exiting lockdown on Sunday, but Mr McDonald said the current plans have been produced without consultations with workers whose lives may be put at risk.Junior business minister Paul Scully told the Commons that it was speaking to hundreds of businesses, unions and Public Health England, with full guidelines published “in due course”.Mr McDonald said: “The proposals themselves are wholly inadequate,” adding that “crucially, worker safety was a legal right before the crisis and must not be cast aside now”.“The documents present measures to maintain safe workplaces such as hand washing and social distancing as being at the discretion of employers, when in fact\u0026nbspthey are requirements of the law. The government should make this clear and inform workers and businesses of their respective rights and duties.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

More significantly, it offered few specifics on when many of its isions might return to normal operations or how it would make up shortfalls in the interim.As its theme parks began to be shuttered, movies could not be released and sports could be played, Disney saw total operating income drop 37 per cent to $2.4bn (£1.9bn) in the quarter ending 31 March. Parks and cruises had profit go from $1.5bn (£1.2bn)\u0026nbspin the quarter last year to $639m\u0026nbsp(£514m) this year, with a loss of about $1bn in revenue.Earnings-per-share, meanwhile, dropped to just 60 cents, a 63 per cent decline compared to the same quarter a year ago and lower than the 89 cents many forecasters expected.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThose reduced numbers were cushioned by the fact that much of the quarter played out before the crisis hit in the US, and many analysts and investors believe the worse is yet to come. The quarter, for instance, included only a few weeks of the park shutdowns in the US.And team sports, on which Disney cable network ESPN heavily relies, were not suspended until about the same time. The company currently lacks a wide range of revenue streams for the new quarter, which runs through June there is no timetable, for instance, on the reopening of US\u0026nbsptheme parks.Created with Sketch.The 25 most anticipated movies and TV shows on Disney+ Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This $100m series created by Jon Favreau is one of six originals teased by Disney for the launch of the streaming platform (with more to come in the future).

Enough said.“Today\u0027s not the point,” said Lloyd Greif, a veteran Los Angeles-based investment banker who closely follows Disney. “We haven\u0027t seen ugly yet. Third and fourth quarter is where the rubber will really hit the road.”Disney\u0027s executives had few answers for analysts on what they could do to stem the tide until the American entertainment economy can resume at anything close to full capacity. They pointed to few scattered revenue-drivers, such as high ratings for its ESPN documentary series\u0026nbspThe Last Dance\u0026nbspand growing subscriptions for Disney Plus, as a way of keeping dollars flowing.Instead, executives sought to paint a longer-term picture that relied on more general advantages like the trustworthiness of the Disney brand.“As someone who\u0027s been around for a while and led the company through some really tough days\u0026nbsp... I have absolute confidence we\u0027ll get through this challenging period and recover successfully,” Bob Iger, the company\u0027s executive chairman and until several months ago its chief executive, told analysts in a call.He said he thought it “quite possible” Disney\u0027s properties will now resonate with consumers more than ever. “People find comfort and inspiration in our messages of hope and optimism,” he said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWhy have share prices been rising while economies have been tanking?Mr Iger, the often-celebrated chief executive who stepped down shortly before the crisis erupted in the US\u0026nbspto focus on content, has retaken more of a public role from successor Bob Chapek as he tries to right the company and his legacy.On the call, Mr Chapek said he thought the cruise ship business, which has been at the epicentre of the coronavirus crisis, could also rebound in the long term. He said Disney\u0027s lines will be “much more resilient” than competitors and noted that “consumers trust our business to react in a responsible way to protect them”.For now, though, the numbers are bleak, and may get bleaker. Disney\u0027s film studio saw an operating income drop of about 8 per cent, to $466m\u0026nbsp(£375m), as the company was unable to release its much anticipated Mulan\u0026nbspat the end of March. That film has been postponed until the end of July. The effect of other postponed spring releases, such as Marvel picture Black Widow, will be felt in the new quarter. The movie has been postponed from May to November.There is no timetable for the playing of NBA and Major League Baseball games that drive viewership to ESPN.The earnings figures preview a potentially dramatic fall for a company that just a few months ago had an iron grip on the entertainment industry. Disney closed 2019 with all five of the highest-grossing movies in the world and more than $20bn\u0026nbsp(£16bn) in revenue for the quarter ending 31 December, a 36 per cent increase from the previous year. Parks alone generated more than $7bn\u0026nbsp(£5.6bn) in revenue and $2bn (£1.6bn) in profit.Disney was facing some challenges, including cord-cutting and a potential slowdown in theatrical revenue, before coronavirus hit. But the pandemic has slammed nearly all of its key isions.The cruise-ship and theme-park unit, which Mr\u0026nbspChapek\u0026nbspoversaw until recently, accounted for nearly 40 per cent of Disney\u0027s overall revenue last year.Though there is no timetable for the reopenings of US\u0026nbspparks, Mr\u0026nbspChapek suggested that the company would go slowly, and also not reopen if executives were not confident visitors would follow.“We would not reopen any park until we can make a positive contribution to overhead and operating-profit level,” he said.Mr Chapek did say that Shanghai Disneyland will open on Monday. He said contact tracing, social-distancing and “early detection systems” will be among the tools used to limit virus exposure. Masks will be given to staff and guests, he said.The opening will serve as a test case for potential US\u0026nbspreopenings in Florida and California, particularly on the issue of capacity. The Chinese government is mandating about 30 per cent capacity, or 24,000 of the roughly 80,000 people who visit the park daily. The first few weeks will see Disney cap the number at below even that, Mr Chapek said, as staffers work out the new protocols.Demi Lovato recalls how eating disorder impacted her on Disney showDisney heiress criticises CEO’s for furloughing staffFlorida Disney World to furlough 43,000 workersDisney has furloughed as many as 100,000 employees beginning in April. Executives have said they will accept cuts in their own compensation. Mr Chapek says he had no timetable on the furloughed employees return. The senior-executive salary cut will continue “until we see a substantive economic recovery”.Disney Plus has been a bright spot for the firm amid the pandemic, with 50 million global sign-ups as of early April. Still, the company does not expect profitability from the service for at least three years. The service is also affected by production shutdowns, limiting its ability to churn out new shows that will attract and retain subscribers.Executives said that they still planned on opening Mulan\u0026nbspin theaters at the end of July, and would have the benefit of what Mr Chapek called a “competitive movie” - Warner Bros\u0027s\u0026nbspTenet\u0026nbsp- opening the week before to see how consumers react. At that point, however, it would likely be too late to change release plans.Disney chief financial officer Christine McCarthy declined to offer definitive comment on any shareholder idend in 2020, saying only there was none planned at the moment and the company will address the matter again “in the next six months”. The company has provided a idend in recent years as its stock price has risen.Disney\u0027s share price has dropped about 10 per cent since the US\u0026nbspclosures due to coronavirus became probable the second week of March. The stock dropped 2 per cent in after-hours trading Tuesday with the earnings news.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Artemis Fowl is now bypassing a theatrical release altogether and will be available to buy at home on 12 June, while the live-action version of Mulan is set to be one of the first new films to be released in cinemas should they re-open in time for its 24 July release date.Damien Chazelle’s The Eddy sounds wonderful but the plot is weak‘On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous’ shows how often love is tied to painLionel Shriver: Most Covid victims would’ve died within a year anywayUniversal prompted backlash from cinema chains after​ NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell told\u0026nbspWall Street Journal\u0026nbspthat home release will be a part of its strategy once the pandemic ends.“The question is, when we come out of this, what is going to be the model?” he said. “I would expect that consumers will return to theatres and we will be part of that.”Following Shell’s initial comments, which AMC Theatres branded “unacceptable”, Cineworld said: “Today we make it clear again that we will not be showing movies that fail to respect the windows as it does not make any economic sense for us.”Universal is the studio that distributes the\u0026nbspFast\u0026nbsp\u0026amp Furious,\u0026nbspJurassic World\u0026nbspand Halloween franchises.

But when you go back to the very beginning of the show, it was Robin and Ted.Smulders\u0026nbspcontinued: “Watching it as a streaming show now, you get a little bit more of a connection for other relationships.

In Los Angeles, US, 700 food packages will go to homeless military veterans. Other projects are in India and Ethiopia.How we treat animals ‘still risking spreading disease’Naomi Hallum, director of the organisation, which is funded by donations, said: “We hope that the $100,000 of food we are giving will help relieve some of the suffering caused by Covid-19, but the real value of our work lies in education, in telling people how and why these pandemics emerge, in showing the destruction caused to our planet and our bodies when we eat animal products.“The coronavirus pandemic, like many others before it, is creating tragedies for families all over the world. None of us wants this to happen ever again but to prevent future outbreaks, there are some difficult lessons we must learn.“If we continue to stress wild animals by decimating their habitats and capture and cage them in markets — and if we continue to mass produce domesticated animals inside squalid factory farms and transport them long distances — there will be no avoiding a future pandemic.”T Colin Campbell, professor emeritus of nutritional biochemistry at Cornell University, New York, claimed: “A wholefoods plant-based diet can prevent, perhaps even reverse, the chronic degenerative diseases that make older iniduals more susceptible to Covid-19.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Families are being torn apart.The health secretary claimed victory in hitting his deadline to pass the threshold by the end of April, announcing that more than 122,000 tests were recorded last Thursday as drive-through centres and home testing-kits helped send numbers soaring\u0026nbspfrom around 10,000 at the start of the month.But critics accused him of manipulating the figures after it emerged the total included around 40,000 test kits which had been sent out but not completed by that stage.And testing numbers have remained below the 100,000 level every day since the 30 April deadline passed, hitting 85,186 in the 24 hours to 4 May.Created with Sketch.Care home hit by coronavirus: A rare glimpse of life inside Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, wearing PPE before going into roomsJack Dodsley, 79, speaks to a carer at Newfield Nursing HomeCarers working at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, sits with a carerJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member at Newfield Nursing Home looks after a residentA carer helps Jack Dodsley, 79, from his chairA staff member at Newfield Nursing HomeA carer brings food to a resident at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member puts on PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, puts on PPE before she enters a roomA bench at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, wearing PPE before going into roomsJack Dodsley, 79, speaks to a carer at Newfield Nursing HomeCarers working at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, sits with a carerJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member at Newfield Nursing Home looks after a residentA carer helps Jack Dodsley, 79, from his chairA staff member at Newfield Nursing HomeA carer brings food to a resident at Newfield Nursing HomeJack Dodsley, 79, with a carer in PPEA staff member puts on PPE at Newfield Nursing HomeJackie Wilson, a healthcare assistant, puts on PPE before she enters a roomA bench at Newfield Nursing HomeIn the House of Commons today, Labour health spokeswoman Rosena Allin-Khan called for the health secretary to commit himself to restoring and maintaining the 100,000 level.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastDr Allin-Khan told the Commons: “The testing strategy has been non-existent.“Community testing was scrapped, mass testing was slow to roll out and testing figures are now being manipulated.“Does the secretary of state commit to a minimum of 100,000 tests each day going forward?

I think she might do well to take a leaf out of the shadow secretary\u0027s book in terms of tone.“I’m afraid what she said is not true. There’s been a rapid acceleration of testing offer the last few months in this country, including getting to 100,000 tests a day.“We’ve been entirely transparent on the way that that has been measured throughout, and I have confidence that the rate will continue to rise.“Currently capacity is 108,000 a day, and we are working to build that higher.“Of course, we’ve been working very hard to make the testing capacity grow as fast as possible and as more tests are available so we are able to make them available\u0026nbsp to more people and test people right across the NHS.”The prime minister\u0027s official spokesman later said: It may be at the moment there is less demand for tests from key workers because the infection rate is stablising or falling. I would hope everyone can agree that that is a good thing. If fewer people are going into hospital with coronavirus symptoms that will mean fewer tests need to be carried out in NHS setting. Likewise, if there\u0027s less community transmission, it will mean that key workers potentially need fewer tests. That shouldn\u0027t be seen as a bad thing.The key point is capacity has been really significantly increased. We can now do more than 100,000 tests a day and as we move forward into the next phase, including the rollout of \u0027trace, track and test\u0027, we have the capacity we need.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I’d be grateful if the leader could ask him to apologise. She is on the frontline of the Covid crisis and deserves an apology.”But in response Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, said the health secretary was doing a “magnificent job” and that “we are very lucky to have someone who has shown such personal commitment” during the coronavirus pandemic.“Therefore, I’m not going to ask him to apologise,” he added. “I’m going to say in the cut and thrust of debate people are entitled to say things and that is perfectly legitimate.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In their paper, The misting characteristics of spectacle lenses, researchers Tom H\u0026nbspMargrain and Chris Owen tested crown glass, CR39 and polycarbonate materials found not all spectacle lenses are created equal.“Both the physical properties of the spectacle lens and a number of environmental factors determine how long spectacles take to demist,” they write.“The polycarbonate lens demisted more rapidly than the CR39 lens which, in turn, demisted more rapidly than the glass lens. This indicates that polycarbonate spectacle lenses should be used in conditions where the adverse effects of spectacle misting need to be minimised.”When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastBut as spectacles are only one part of the problem, they are only one part of the solution.The researchers showed how face masks direct much of the exhaled air upwards towards the spectacle lenses, and the misting occurs from the warm water vapour condensing on the cooler surface of the lens.As a result, tiny droplets form due to the surface tension between water molecules. The droplets scatter the light and reduce the ability of the lenses to transmit contrast.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Many studies show women are more focused on building community and teams.They are more likely than men to cultivate a erse set of advisers to help them succeed. They are also more likely to follow advice.A study by management consulting firm McKinsey found that women are more people- orientated and spend more time developing and coaching other leaders in their organisation. In other words, they don’t need to reserve all the glory for themselves.There is something  at play too, though. Female leaders are more likely to be blameddecisions are unpopular or ineffective. They are questioned and second-guessed more often than men.But then Covid- entered the equation and presented world leaders with a new challenge — an invisible enemy that is highly contagious, unpredictable and deadly.This pandemic has been an unprecedented test for all concerned.And guess what  A disproportionate number of those who have passed this test — countries such as Germany, New Zealand, Iceland and Finland — have women at the helm.It is not exclusively female-led countries that are doing well, of course. But bearing in mind only seven per cent of all world leaders are women, about  per cent of countries led by women are doing well when it comes to containing Covid-. Global health experts have concluded that one thing that has led to success in tackling coronavirus is — speed.Prof Tom Bollyky, director of global health programme at US think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations, said: “Countries that have not dithered in their response, that have mobilised quickly, have done well.”New Zealand’s PM Jacinda Ardern put it simply: “Go hard and go early.”The number of Covid--related deaths is predicted to be substantially lower in areas where leaders acted sooner, even by a week, because they flattened the curve and prevented new cases.Many women acted first and made the brave decision to shut down le as we knew it, even though that was an unpopular thing to do.But it seems women leaders are listening to World Health Organisation advice and also looking at other countries for guidance.They don’t think they have all the answers but women are able to put their ego to one side and let experts guide them — something which cannot be said of Donald Trump.Incidentally, I have not seen any women leaders making unfounded or dangerous suggestions about possible cures. Can you imagine a woman leader suggesting that people inject Dettol into themselves, as dingbat Trump recently suggested Or can you imagine a woman suggesting to people that they can fight coronavirus and winthey are strong enough This pandemic is not a battle to be fought and won. It is a virus, which can affect literally anyone.No one knows how they will be affected and that bullish “fight it” approach is, in my experience, very male. Conversely, the decision to protect everyone, putting the most at risk first, is more female.It’s interesting that some male leaders seem more interested in covering up the problems. Like Donald Trump, who thinks he is an expert on everything and more fixated on garnering praise for what he has done than fixing and getting right what has not gone so well.I know I am talking in generalisations here but my experience of women is that we want to understand the mistakes and fix them, not cover them up.This pandemic has been full of dficulty and tragedy for everyone.But perhaps one good thing that will come out of it is that the world will acknowledge women deserve an equal  when it comes to leadership.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

British journalism, in particular.What’s stopping you right now from falling off your perch in fits of laughter  Well, the fact that you’re currently digesting a work of journalism.This probably means that it’s an act – let’s call it that for now – which you’re used to committing on a fairly regular basis.Let’s also assume then that much of the information you gather, store and share comes from such journalistic sources.It’s likely you frequently form opinions and make decisions based on this content you consume.In fact, think really hard for a moment and try and imagine an area of your le where you haven’t been guided in some form by journalism.Buying a house, investing your savings, choosing a school, picking a holiday, deciding which box to put your cross in when you go into a polling booth .If you’re honest with yourself, you tend to make most of those decisions after you’ve digested the array of journalism available to you. And let’s also admit, disregarded too.Some of it is opinion led, some is impartial. You might not agree with all of it, and sometimes you might get ruddy cross at a paper or commentator that doesn’t chime with your world view.But together, the many erse components of British journalism create something which is profoundly valuable.The Covid- pandemic has tested our society to the limit. In the midst of a national crisis, journalists have been putting their lives at risk to keep you informed.News outlets have faithfully broadcast public health announcements – but also held our political leaders to account.The Downing Street daily conference has become a household staple, with ministerial interrogation by the press corps regularly influencing government policy.Without such probing questions and front page splashes, would you have known about the dearth of PPE or the crisis in our care homes Journalism, from local to national level, has connected communities in a way that social networks can only dream of. We have celebrated triumph in the face of adversity – and also documented tributes from the tens of thousands who have lost loved ones.But now we come to the rub.With the country under lockdown, British journalism is facing the biggest threat in its storied history.For newspapers, sales have dramatically fallen. For broadcasters and online outlets, advertising has gone through the floor even whilst audience numbers have risen.Yes, journalism joins one of many industries in financial peril right now.The work of reporters should be held up to scrutiny like any other profession. But we also need to acknowledge the sacrices its practitioners are making to keep the public informed.Everything that journalism hands to you doesn’t come for free.I’m sure that when you think about this properly, in a way you might never have done before, it really is needed more than everWe have to safeguard journalism. It is far too important to discard because it isn’t worth contemplating what the world would look likequality journalism didn’t exist.I don’t need to urge you to buy a paper or take up an online subscription, but I want you to tell everyone you meet that our sector is under a very real and present threat.I am the CEO of the Journalists’ Charity. It was founded in  by Charles Dickens and a group of parliamentary reporters – naturally in a pub.Our core mission to this day remains the same: to bring aid to journalists and their dependents who have fallen on hard times.We are stepping up to the mark, helping those in need with emergency funding and practical and emotional support.It’s why we’ve launched a #supportjournalism campaign in print and on social media.For me, a lockdown without journalists would be unthinkable.That’s why the Journalists’ Charity is standing four-square behind our industry when it needs us most.

He’s just Jamie Oliver with a skipping rope, I assumed, before this wretched lockdown business began.A character we’ve all seen in our local park, with a pair of boxing gloves and a stopwatch, charging financial managers £ a haemorrhoid to do some sit-ups over by the ornamental lake.One of Britain’s ever-growing army of personal trainers who,he wasn’t bouncing around on YouTube every morning, would be clogging up Love Island or Ex On The Beach.That’s what I thought, anyway.Then the coronavirus hit, the local swimming pool shut, the man became a phenomenon and before I could come to my senses, Joe and his infernal timing device were beeping away in my living room, every morning, as I joined in his PE lesson. Inevitably, it didn’t last.First, Joe’s routine did me what I can only describe as “a mischief”.Then, one morning, aged , I caught sight of myself, in a picture frame, doing his “reverse frog shuffle” and thought: “Stuff this for type two diabetes.

Nah, only joking.”The jokes need to go the same way as the viewers’ poems, in honour of Joe, which he was actually reading out loud, until modesty finally prevailed.Much safer ground is the “spot the dference” competition, which borders on insulting, when he’s merely placed his wall atlas upside down or swapped his electric guitar for a ukulele, but does hint at the drive, ambition and ego behind the man.One day he replaced the atlas with a picture of himself, the next with a picture of his “other house” in Los Angeles and suddenly the penny dropped.Joe’s loaded and his head is not just on its way to Hollywood, it’s already there, making movies and doing squat thrusts with Gwyneth and Brad.The weird thing is, in other presenters, soap actors or comedians, I’d roll my eyes at the folly.With Joe Wicks, I don’t. ’Cos I can’t help it, I quite like him.Part of that may be linked to his no-frills background and a level of personal generosity that’s way beyond most of us .But I like to think it’s got more to do with the fact that, at a time when other cynical, doom-mongering TV hosts are desperately trying to read the public mood, reinvent themselves and force their agenda on viewers, Joe Wicks is just doing what he’s always done.

The scheme could then be reduced even further over coming months - encouraging people to look for new jobs.A senior government source said: “People are addicted to the scheme.“We’re not talking about a clf-edge but we have to get people back to work.”The changes being considered are focused on “incentivising work,” another added.Mr Sunak is expected to announce how the job retention scheme will change after June next week.He wants to give firms certainty about the scheme beyond June and making an announcement by the end of next week is key because employers who are planning to make staff redundant in July must give  days notice. The deadline for this is May .The Sun understands that options being considered include only making the job retention scheme available to workers who the Treasury deem as most financially unstable.This could include renters who are living “hand-to-mouth” each month and whose large proportion of income goes on rent and bills. They are also less protected than homeowners, who are eligible for mortgage holidays. Although tenants can only apply for rental deferrals, landlords are not obliged to comply, while the move would also help prevent them being evicted due to unpaid rent.This could be administered by targeting certain age groups, such as millennials - workers in their s and s who are much more likely to rent.This idea would help young workers stay attached to their current jobs and help protect their future job prospects.Treasury insiders said changes to the scheme could see only workers in sectors that are deemed vital to protect kept on the furlough scheme.This could also allow the Treasury to keep workers furloughed in industries that are likely to be closed longer-term, such as pubs, restaurants, hotels and the tourism industry in general.But industry experts warned that this would cause problems for small businesses that don’t fit into one sector.Federation of Small Businesses chief Mike Cherry warned: “Government must avoid applying a sector straightjacket that doesn’t work for small firms – there are far too many businesses who don’t fit neatly into one box who will need time to get back up and running – like small companies that mainly supply to hotels but aren’t hospitality businesses.”The Treasury is also looking at allowing furloughed employees to work part-time. The Government’s subsidy would be smaller under this option, but it would avoid employers being forced to bar staff from working in order to be eligible for the wage support.The Treasury has said that designing a part-time furlough scheme would be much harder to administer.But officials have told industry groups that it is possible and they are waiting for “political direction”.The FSB’s Mr Cherry urged the Chancellor to prioritise working on finding a part-time furlough scheme that would offer businesses maximum flexibility as they attempt to reopen in the coming weeks.He said: “Small firms must be allowed to get back on their feet one step at a time –  million jobs depend on it.“It’s a dficult situation, but the only feasible option is to allow part time furloughing where furloughed staff canto work for part of their contracted hours. This will enable small employers to stagger back theof their staff at a time when we know economic activity will be at record low levels.”He added: “We need to see these changes made from the beginning of June as small businesses restart. Orders are going unfulfilled because a few hours work doesn’t justy bringing somebody off furlough. Businesses can’t even quote for jobs once lockdown lts. Time is of the essence.”News of the plans to tweak the job retention scheme come after Mr Sunak confirmed earlier this week that he was working on the best way to gradually close it down, which is currently due to run until the end of June.He told ITV News: To anyone anxious about this, I want to reassure that there will be no clf-edge to the furlough scheme.Im working as we speak to figure out the most effective way to wind down the scheme and ease people back into work in a measured way.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Modelling of viral shedding in  patients with Covid- and  transmission pairs suggests that the highest viral load is at or just before symptom onset, with  per cent of transmission occurring before symptoms.Speaking on BBC Radio  this morning, one of the authors of the report Lucy Yardley, who is a professor of health psychology at the University of Southampton and Bristol said:  You really want to isolate from them as much as you possibly can.If you have more than one room in the house then they need to be in a room completely on their own, and not coming out into the kitchen andyou can have dferent places to wash that would be good. “If you can’t then you need to have very good cleaning of the taps and the shared surfaces after they have used them, you need good ventilation in the home so that any germs that are circulating go to the open air, there are a whole number of things you can and need to do and people tend to think it’s inevitable we will get it.She highlighted that this in fact is not the case.We did do a large trial with over , people in the last pandemic and in seasonal flu years it showed you really can reduce the infection in the household by doing all these things.The authors of the report highlighted that behavioural interventions could help improve infection control within families.They also encouraged people who were caring for those with Covid to look to a Germ Defence website that was originally developed during the HN pandemic that last about  months.GermDefence.org has now been adapted for Covid- and is being rolled out to help limit the transmission of the virus.Use of such behavioural interventions could support public health advice to improve infection control in families, the study concluded.Professor Yardley added that in some cases many people have become too concerned with catching the illness from other members of the public.People are actually worried too much about passing somebody on the street without a mask, unless they cough in your face, which is obviously dangerous.Otherwise that’s probably not very risky, but having to spend a considerable amount of time next to someone then that is a tricky situation.The report also stated that the Government, while looking to protect NHS staff in hospitals, should consider looking at other options for households.The authors wrote: Promoting infection control measures in the community is a priority for the UK government and will continue to be so as stay at home policies are lted.Dissemination of evidence based behavioural interventions may help increase adoption of public health advice and reduce viral load.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

or up to  per centcombined with self-isolation for those who have symptoms and their households.Ministers are understood to have considered the idea, and Health Secretary Matt Hancock did not rule it out when pressed on the idea yesterday.A spokesman for No said earlier this week it was perfectly reasonably that we will look at how guidance will apply for dferent age bands and well continue to be guided by the science.There is a massively disproportionate risk of death when elderly and vulnerable people catch coronavirus.Boris Johnson is expected to lay out his blueprint for how Britain will ease restrictions on Sunday.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said the next phase should be more comfortable and more sustainable for Brits.Restrictions on outdoor activities are likely to be lted first, Downing Street said yesterday.People may be able to enjoy the outdoors with small bubbles of families and friends over coming weeks.For the rest of Britain, some form of social distancing and hand hygiene will still be needed, but more drastic restrictions could be relaxed without setting off a second wave of infections.Oxford University professor of gerontology Sarah Harper said classing all over s as vulnerable would mean some healthy, active, older iniduals could be sentenced to their homes unfairly.She said: “Easing lockdown might be more effectivethe risks were explicitly explained to the population, the possible range of vulnerabilities highlighted and iniduals asked to take appropriate action.These are sensible public health approaches which might have a better chance of being complied with.Senior mental health experts share Professor Harpers concerns, saying healthy, elderly Brits needed to be freed from lockdown.  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY--v.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day -

and hooked themselves up to breathing contraptions, believing the air itself was toxic.While the origins of the original influenza outbreak  have never been fully determined it became known as Spanish flu although is also known as the  flu pandemic which was caused by the HN influenza A virus.It first appeared in spring  and lasted until early summer .Estimates say around million people were affected, about a third of the world’s population, at the time.It’s thought the death toll to have been between m and m people, making it one of the deadliest pandemics ever.In an effort to keep morale strong during World War I, censors minimised early reports of the illness and mortality rates but because Spain had remained neutral newspapers were free to report the epidemic’s effects in the country, including the illness of King Alfonso XIII.Those reports helped fuel the impression Spain was especially badly affected by the disease, giving rise to the name Spanish flu.The outbreak seemed affect young adults, who had a particularly high death rate from the disease.Scientists have given a number of explanations why this was with some analyses indicating that it triggered a “cytokine storm” which attacked the stronger immune system of young adults.However a  study of medical journals at the time found the viral infection was no more aggressive than previous influenza strains.It

influencing advice.He said: Why we didn’t respond so much sooner once this epidemic broke out in China, I simply don’t know.And I say this because in , we published a report on actions needed to deal

A cross-party group of MPs and peers, backed by a leading charity, fears a lack of checks on some businesses could pave the way for workers to be exploited. They have written to Home Secretary Priti Patel calling for labour inspectors to be classed as essential workers so scrutiny can continue during the Covid- lockdown.Lucila Granada, chief executive of charity Focus on Labour Exploitation, said: “Many low-paid workers are losing their jobs and urgently seeking new income desperation will prevent them from saying ‘no’ to abusive conditions, making inspection even more imperative than ever before.“Without this in place, we may see a surge in modern slavery cases over the coming months.”Nearly  politicians, including Labour, Lib Dem, Conservative, SNP, DUP and Alliance Party MPs, have written to Ms Patel, Business Secretary Alok Sharma and Safeguarding Minister Victoria Atkins demanding action. Their letter says: “Given the heightened risks of exploitation during this crisis, it is vital that enforcement agencies are able to conduct labour inspections and act to prevent exploitation.“The Government has rightly recognised that workers in food production are critical to the coronavirus response, but it must also include the people who ensure that they have safe, legal working conditions.”The letter warns that “widespread job losses and hoursapos reductions for those in low-paid work are being reported by frontline services”. It fears sacked staff will be “unable to turn down job offers with abusive or exploitative conditions, as this will mean a choice between affording basic living costs and facing destitution”. The signatories add: “Over time and left unchecked, this is likely to lead to a spike in modern slavery offences as trafficking gangs and others exploit these workers’ predicament.” The letter calls for workplace inspectors to be given enough personal protective equipment to carry out their roles – and for extra cash “to conduct preventative campaigns and monitoring, especially in high-risk sectors”.Ms Granada added: “Labour inspectors play a crucial role in keeping our workplaces and essential workers safe during these dficult times. “The failure to include them as ‘essential workers’ is an oversight that must be rectied immediately. “Our research has found that workers are already experiencing pandemic-related abuses. “This includes refusal of entitlements to sick pay and forcing people with symptoms to go to work who should be self-isolating to protect their own and the public health.” Lib Dem home affairs spokeswoman Christine Jardine, who organised the letter, said: “It’s absolutely vital that we recognise that the coronavirus crisis is leaving the most vulnerable in our communities at risk."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus government confirms local lockdowns","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Government confirms local lockdownsvirus spikes after rules relaxedCommunities could be plunged back into lockdown in whack-a-mole fashionthe virus starts to take hold againShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY News \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Prime Minister is expected to set out his aposroadmapapos for easing the measures in an address to the nation on Sunday.

Announcing them on Sunday and implementing them on Monday means MPs may not have a chance to ask questions about them before they take effect.

Small shops and outdoor workplaces would reopen in the first phase in early June, followed by large shopping centres and some offices in the second phase, according to the plan seen by The Times. Ministers have already made clear that pubs, restaurants, hotels and leisure centres will be among the last to open - and the Times reports they will be in the final phase. Downing Street and Treasury sources declined to confirm or deny the reports ahead of Boris Johnson announcing a aposroadmapapos out of lockdown on Sunday. No suggested the UK plan won’t have set dates for each phase like have been announced where. Boris Johnson’s spokesman said: “What we’ll have to do as we make changes is monitor the impact those changes are having upon the R rate in particular. “And once we have that information, we’ll obviously be able to judgeand when we’re in a position to go further.” Government officials have already made clear the lockdown will not lt all at once.

And draft guidance on how workplaces cansafely has been circulated to unions and business leaders. Ministers have also confirmed schools willin phases. Itaposs thought this would happen from June  at the earliest, with primary schools and especially Year  the first to . The Prime Minister is expected to spell out more of his thinking about how and when lockdown might eventually be eased - after the formal deadline to extend it this Thursday. Today he said the first measures would start to lt on Mondaywe possibly can. He told PMQs: The reason for that is very simple, that we have to be sure the the data is going to support our ability to do this. That data is coming in continuously over the next few days.

Meanwhile the welfare advice charity TurnUs has seen a % rise in people using a benefit calculator - and , used a tool to search for charitable grants. MPs heard today the rise in cases has been driven mainly by workers, parents and householders - with most of the % rise in food bank use being driven by families with children. Emma Revie of foodbank charity the Trussell Trust told the Commons Work and Pensions Committee she was struck by the speed with which people fell into “crisis”. Anna Stevenson of TurnUs added: “Women are being much more affected in terms of loss of income than men”. Charity leaders gave evidence to MPs on the surge in people seeking help amid the outbreak.

Hundreds of people are still dying each day from coronavirus. But now that weaposre past the peak, Boris Johnson will lay out a roadmap on Sunday  May for how lockdown will be eased. He will change very little immediately - and wonapost end lockdown in one go. But he suggested some changes will take effect from Monday  May. And in the long term, his plan will give us a clearer picture of what the UK will look like over the coming months in a new, coronavirus-scarred world. Schools and outdoor activities are set to resume within weeks, while pubs and restaurants look doomed to stay closed for months. Meanwhile the furlough scheme will be wound down after June, fines for breaching lockdown will rise, and you could be told to cover your face in public. So what will reopen, what will stay shut - and how will your everyday le change Weaposve explained the timeline and all the main proposals below.for the Mirror Politics newsletter at www.mirror email -at .am to navigate the day ahead.When will lockdown end The Prime Minister will lay out his roadmap for ending lockdown on Sunday  May - and he says some measures will be lted as early as Monday  Maywe possibly can. A minister will also address the House of Commons on Monday  May. But lockdown will not end all in one go. Immediate measures on Monday are likely to be only very minor and we donapost know yet what theyaposll be.Experts say some closures or social distancing will last until , when weaposre likely to have a vaccine. Cabinet minister Michael Gove warned: Ultimately, unless and until we have a vaccine, then I suspect we’re going to have to live with some degree of constraint because of the nature of the virus. Meanwhile, the legal date to review the lockdown is Thursday  May. That review will keep restrictions in place - but no detail will be announced on that day.  Will we be given specic dates  This seems unlikely. The Irish government has spelt out five phases each with a target date between May and August. But while Downing Street hasnapost denied using phases, they probably wonapost have a specic date. Instead Boris Johnson’s spokesman said: “What we’ll have to do as we make changes is monitor the impact those changes are having upon the R rate in particular. “And once we have that information, we’ll obviously be able to judgeand when we’re in a position to go further.”  What will the roadmap talk about It will spell out how the lockdown changes in phases over time. It may have a traffic light system spelling out what you can and canapost do as restrictions lt. The plan could also drop the governmentaposs stay at home branding in favour of a more subtle message. But it will also make clear that the UK is not ing to business as usual.Some restrictions will be eased, but others - like fines for breaches - will be made harsher than they are now. While people are put back on public transport and in some workplaces, there will be strict social distancing to keep people two metres apart. People are likely to be advised to cover their faces, and will be told to use an NHS phone app that alerts youyouaposve come into close contact with the virus.  How does the R number, apostest, track and traceapos and five tests come into all this  The aposRapos number is the average number of people infected by each Covid- carrier. It has to be low enough for each stage of the roadmap to begin. Currently R is between . and . because so many people are out of contact with each other. Every time you relax a lockdown rule, R rises again. Ministers say they wonapost do anything that pushes the R number back above . The UK must also pass five tests before easing lockdown:The NHS is able to cope A sustained fall in deaths New infections dropping enough Adequate testing and PPE No risk of a second peak that overwhelms NHSTo help pass all these tests there is a apostest, track and traceapos strategy planned for launch at the middle of May. It will mean downloading an NHS app which tells youyouaposve been near a Covid- carrier - and ensuring you isolate quicklyyouaposre put at risk to stop it spreading further. More on this below. So what will the plan say   Schools Schools will reopen in a phased way - with some year groups likely to go back first while others are told to remain at home.Boris Johnson has signalled he wants primary schools to be the first to , and it is likely that Year  will be the first to . Years  and  would then be the first back in secondary schools, according to one plan. Priority could also be put on pupils with special educational needs. Teachers need time to put social distancing in place, including reorganising classrooms to keep children  metres apart. Sources suggest this will begin as early as June . No declined to sayall pupils will be back before September. Universities Arts students will be the last to , with students of medicine, dentistry and veterinary science prioritised in the autumn, according to the Sunday Times. Thirty-three universities are working on a contingency plan to fast-track students of the key sciences back to campus.  Public transport The number of trains will slowly rise as lockdown eases, to avoid overcrowding. Hand sanitiser and one-way systems would be placed on the network, with spacing at s and bus stops “clearly marked out” to keep people two metres apart. New timetables will be introduced as planned in May, even though trains will not run to them straight away. Firms would be urged to stagger workersapos start times to spread out the rush out. But London mayor Sadiq Khan has warned capacity could be overwhelmed. A double decker London bus would have to have just  passengers. Meanwhile the government has hinted at more support for Cycle to Work, a tax break scheme where you can buy a bicycle over a year through your employer.  Workplaces and working from home Workplaces would have floor markings to ensure people are two metres apart, according leaked draft guidance. The guidance could also recommend staggered arrival times and breaks, fewer people in lts and regular deep cleaning. According to BuzzFeed News, other draft measures for workplaces include:Providing additional parking or bike racks Having more entrances into the workplace Alternatives to touch-based security devices such as keypads Washing unorms on site rather than at home Reducing maximum occupancy for lts, providing hand sanitiser for the operation of lts and encouraging use of stairs Introducing more one-way flow routes through buildings Reviewing layouts to allow staff to work further apart from each otherBut workers would in some cases be allowed to sit less than two metres apart - despite the risk being  to  times higher at one metre than two metres. Not all workers would go back to the officethey donapost need to. Government advisors have previously said working from home could become the new normal until thereaposs a vaccine for coronavirus.The furlough scheme At the moment, .m workers are having their wages paid by the state - up to % or £, a month. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned this is not sustainable because it costs as much as the NHS. The furlough scheme runs in full up to the end of June and will then be wound down.Officials appear to be looking at cutting the amount to workers and the self-employed or limiting it only to certain sectors. This has sparked fears some will lose out. The future of the furlough scheme wonapost be announced on Sunday. Sources said it would be in the week or two weeks after the PMaposs address on Sunday.Picnics, golf course, tennis and going outdoors People will be allowed to exercise more than once a day, drive to the countryside and have picnics, according to the Mail on Sunday. And the Daily Mail claims golf courses, tennis courts and fishing lakes will reopen from June too. Youaposd still have to be with members of your own household only, and keep two metres away from other groups.  No has not confirmed these reports.But ministers and scientists have repeatedly said outdoor activities are less risky than those indoors - indicating theyaposll be the first to be allowed back.  Supermarkets Supermarkets would doubtless keep many of the social distancing measures theyaposve already put in place. And opening hours could be increased on Sunday to reduce overcrowding. Boris Johnson has said heaposs looking at relaxing Sunday trading laws to reduce queues on the weekend.  Building sites Building sites were never told to close under lockdown guidance - as long as two metres could be kept between workers. So the government is expected to make a renewed push for people toto work there. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said because the risk of the virus outdoors is lower than indoors, there’s “more scope” for some jobs outside. He added: “Thereaposs more scope for people ing to work on building sites for example, or more outdoor leisure activities than is likely to be the case for indoor ones.”  aposBubblesapos of up to  people People could meet small bubbles of their friends and family under one idea to ease the coronavirus lockdown. Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish government was looking at the proposal as one possible way to relax restrictions on peopleaposs movement in the future. But she warnedthe idea does happen, itaposs got to be the same people day-to-day, week-to-week to prevent Covid- being passed on more widely. That means people would have to choose one bubble of friends or family - and stick with them, while continuing not to meet other people they love. Reports later said the idea was one being mulled by the UK government. But itaposs not set in stone.  Fines for breaching lockdown The government is considering raising the penalty for defying lockdown from £ to £ for a first offence. The fines would then double for each offence after that, just as they do already. And the maximum fine would rise from just under £, at the moment to £,. A senior government source did not deny these figures, reported by the Sunday , were under consideration. Covering your face The government hasnapost made a final decision on whether to ask people to cover their face in public. However, some kind of face covering advice is widely expected after Boris Johnson covering oneaposs face in some situations would be a useful tool. Itaposs understood thatface coverings are required, they wonapost be masks. The government doesnapost want to cause a shortage in personal protective equipment that should be available to the NHS. But coverings like a scarf could be recommended. And the government would provide guidance on what kind of material you can make such a covering from. Itaposs important that people donapost end up fiddling with their face covering in a way that means theyaposre actually creating more risk, by continually touching their face.  Using a new app A new contact tracing app is expected to launch in around mid-May after trials on the Isle of Wight this week. The app, which is voluntary, will use Bluetooth to track when people have come into close contact with someone who, now or later, tests positive for coronavirus. It will urge someone who’s been in contact with a virus carrier to get tested and to isolate themselvesnecessary. It is part of the crucial “test, track and trace” strategy that is needed before the UK-wide lockdown can be relaxed. The idea is that this would allow society to partially reopen while keeping the virus at bay and sick people in isolation. For it to work properly, at least % or so of the population need to download it. It will be paired with an army of , human contact tracers to follow up on those who need further attention, or those who don’t download the app.  Arriving in the UK Ministers are actively looking at quarantining people who arrive into the UK once lockdown begins to ease. Nothing is confirmed, but reports have suggested people will be asked to isolate themselves for two weeks. If so, this would be a major blow to the airline industry and render most holidays to Britain pointless. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC: I think it’s important... that we ensure the sacrices in the sense of social distancing that we’re asking the British people to make are matched by anybody who comes to this country. So I am actively looking at these issues right now. So that when we have infection rates within the country under control, weaposre not importing. Local lockdowns The government is considering new wave of local lockdown restrictions later this year to stop new spikes of coronavirus in their tracks. At the moment, officials are focused on easing the lockdown at the same pace across the UK - to move as one nation in the Covid- crisis. But itaposs understood officials are looking at changing that approachthere is a rapid new second outbreak of the virus, which needs quick action to be halted. A government source said: If you were to see worrying increases of transmission happening in regions, then you would want to move quickly to try and stop those.  Pubs, grassroots sport, mass gatherings and other venues Pubs will be the last places to reopen as lockdown is eased, the Government has confirmed. Likewise, ministers have indicated that mass gatherings will be among the last things to reopen. But some local cricket and grassroots football could– as long as spectators can stay in the open air. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Jenny Harries said: “Outdoor environments are safer. Butyou go with a load of friends and sit in a pub… that’s not a good thing to do.” And Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told the No coronavirus update: “Transmission is signicantly less outdoors than indoors.” Meanwhile hairdressers and nail bars could remain shut for six months, sources told The Sun. A aposone UKapos approach Scotland and Wales have repeatedly set out plans ahead of, or slightly dferently to, the rest of the UK government. And itaposs true that the Scottish and Welsh governments have control over areas like schools and care homes. However, ministers have also stressed they want to keep the whole of the UK moving in the same way at the same time. And the government has distanced itself from claims that worst-hit regions, like London and the West Midlands, could have dferent rules to the countryside. NHS services Some routine operations and fertility treatment have already been restored as hospital inpatients fall for several weeks in a row. However, itaposs not yet clear when other services - including ENT therapies and dentistry, where staff are particularly at risk of transmission - will continue.

He decided to rewrite the official government guidance he had urged the rest of us to follow, and opted to stay home, break the rules, and get laid. He and married lover Antonia Staats got fed up with being two meeters apart, and hooked up twice in two weeks. Ms Staats, who is married to a data scientist, was presumably hoping to benefit from nerd immunity.He was not anti her body, expressed a preference for the German-born model, and itaposs probably safe to assume he flattened her curves as she helped him past the peak.He has now outlined an exit strategy from his position as a senior member of the governmentaposs Screwing Around Group in Emergencies , claiming he thought he was immune from being caught.She, meanwhile, reportedly thought it would be fine to have it prof because she was treating two house husbands, on opposite sides of London, as though they were one husband.  Journalistic inquiries as to whether they had modelled this outcome are ongoing, and one hopes they had appropriate access to PPE. If only heaposd entered cockdown, as Deltapoll has found % of us have done in the past  weeks, and had a bit less sex. But whataposs good about him getting Covid-, I hear you ask. And will we ever get any Firstly, we were bored at breakfast, but bonking boffins brought us brevity by bedtime. For a while, the chilling atmosphere of fear and apathy has been titivated with a little spice - tittle-tattle, itaposs true, but like all the best gossip itaposs the sort that leaves those who hear it feeling morally superior. Second, whoever had Boris Johnson in the sweepstake for the first illicit coronashag is going to be sorely disappointed. Le takes everyone by surprise. But third and fourth thoughts are a little darker. What was the route of transmission for this story, which is about a man blamed for forcing the government into an expensive lockdown, and which first appeared in a newspaper blamed for being Boris Johnsonaposs personal mouthpiece It appeared without photographic evidence or reports from eyewitnesses, when both would usually be required to substantiate such a tale. The only confirmation appears to be the professoraposs confession, which is a curious response to an embarrassing story without publishable proof.And lastly,one of the nationaposs finest minds thinks the lockdown rules are too strict, then either they ARE too strict, or the nationaposs finest minds arenapost so fine after all. In which case their disease modelling and resulting lockdown might be in doubt, and my head hurts at all the possibilities that would need modelling next. Prof Ferguson said he assumed he was immune, having had and recovered from coronavirus. If thataposs a safe assumption to make, everyone  whoaposs recovered can get out and about as well - potentially millions of us.Ms Staats, it is said, considers the two households to be as one. If so, then it is surely also safe for isolating grandparents to socialise with isolating families, and for mutually-isolating neighbours to have playdates. It seems the government has had ideas in this direction already, briefing journalists people may be allowed to form aposbubblesapos with other households, and meet up for picnics. While the Prof has paid the price for going off-message, across the country there are many people thinking much the same. Thatthey and their loved ones have been locked down for weeks, and cannot possibly be infectious, thereaposs no harm in putting our arms around one another again."},{"url":null,"title":"british street humble 38000 house","story":"NewsBritish street where humble £, house is next door to one worth £. millionEXCLUSIVE: Five bedroom mansion with gym, pool, badminton court and bar for  people is just yards away from house worth barely more than UK’s average yearly salary, and both are on the marketShareCommentsByPhil Cardy:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe £.m mansion is for sale next to its £. neighbour \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

In some countries we have managed to get the number of new cases right down. If we get there and succeed, then we will be able to take clinical advice on whether its safe for those people be able to hug their grandchildren. Mr Hancock also told Sky News that there is no guarantee a vaccine will be found. Speaking as the UK death toll passes ,, Matt Hancock said Britons may have to find a way to live with the virusthe race to develop a vaccine fails. He said: If a vaccine canapost be found then we have to learn to find a way to live with this virus so that means getting the numbers down and holding them down through, for instance, mass-scale testing and then tracing the virus through a combination of technology and human contact tracers.  He added: We may well be able to release some of those measures before a vaccine is availablewe can get the number of new cases right down. If we succeed in doing that we will be able to take clinical advice on whether it is safe for those who are shielded to, for instance, to hug their grandchildren. That is right at the front of my mind. Mr Hancock rejected claims the Government had sacriced people in care homes in order to protect the NHS during the pandemic.

Researchers had feared that there were more than one type of SARS-CoV-, the virus that causes the killer disease, circulating - with one more deadly than the other. But scientists from the Medical Research Council-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Researchhave branded this unfounded. Although thousands of mutations have been found, researchers say the numbers are still relatively low, which is grounds for optimism. Dr Oscar MacLean, from the CVR, said: By analysing the extensive genetic sequence iation present in the genomes of the SARS-CoV- virus, the evolutionary analysis shows why these claims that multiple types of the virus are currently circulating are unfounded.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at  mirror email  -after the press conference every evening. It is important people are not concerned about virus mutations - these are normal and expected as a virus passes through a population. However, these mutations can be useful as they allow us to track transmission history and understand the historic pattern of global spread. Viruses, including the one causing Covid-, naturally accumulate mutations - or changes - in their genetic sequence as they spread through populations. Scientists said most of these changes will have no effect on the biology of the virus or the aggressiveness of the disease they cause.  It was reported earlier this year that scientists had found two or three strains of SARS-CoV- circulating in the population, evidenced by certain mutations that had been detected. However extensive analysis by the team found these detected mutations are unlikely to have any al signicance, and, importantly, do not represent dferent virus types. The centreaposs CoV-GLUE resource tracks SARS-CoV-aposs amino acid replacements, insertions and deletions, which have been observed in samples from the pandemic. To date the database has catalogued , mutations in the pandemic.  Scientists said that while this may sound like a lot of change, it is a relatively low rate of evolution for a virus that has ribonucleic acidas its genetic material. They expect more mutations will continue to accumulate as the pandemic continues. Most observed mutations would be expected to have no, or minimal, consequence to the virusaposs biology, however tracking these changes can help scientists better understand the pandemic and how Covid- is spreading in the community. The study is published in Virus Evolution and the work was funded by the Medical Research Council. Elsewhere, other scientists say they have identied a new coronavirus strain that has become dominant worldwide.The researchers have been tracking changes to the spike of the virus that gives it its distinctive shape. They warn that in addition to making it grow faster, the mutation may make people vulnerable to a second infection after a first bout with the disease. The Los Alamos team, assisted by scientists at Duke University and the University of Sheffield in England, identied  mutations.

Kaitlyn said: At first I told him to get a grip and told him he was hungover - but on March  he called an ambulance which brought him to hospital. They kept him in less than  hours and sent him home saying he probably had a chest infection. He went home and for a whole week he could not get out of bed.

Before the lockdown came into force questions had been raised about the safe use of gyms as the killer virus swept through the UK.Speaking to Sky News, immunologist Dr Jenna Macciochi said before the lockdown said: I think people should be extra vigilant in any area where there may be lots of people close together and sharing equipment such as gyms as this may increase transmission of infection."},{"url":null,"title":"heres how people could kept","story":"NewsHeres how people could be kept apart on buses when coronavirus lockdown endsTransport operator First Bus trialling social distancing techniques for passengers that could be rolled out across its networkand when the UKs lockdown easesShareCommentsByTalia ShadwellReporterTristan Cork:,  MAY NewsUsing public transport could be subject to strict rules post-lockdown \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

That means more buses, which is more costly so that is unsustainable in the longer period.

At the height of the lockdown, passenger numbers in Bristol dropped by  per cent, and bus services were cut back to less than half, the Post reported. But surveys nationally have suggested travelling on public transport is at or near the top of most people’s lists of concerns. First Bus Bristol operations boss James Freeman said he was keen to reassure people they were making preparations to make bus travel as safe as possible, as he announced the social distancing trial. “We are closely monitoring our services to ensure that social distancing is being observed at all times for the wellbeing of our passengers and drivers,” he said.  “Now that we are seeing the first signs of workers ing, we have reviewed our social distancing arrangements on our buses. “In addition to creating extra capacity at busier times of the day, our new seating pilot on service  will act as a visual guide to show customers how they can maintain social distancing whilst travelling by bus. “If it proves effective in helping both our customers and drivers, we will introduce it to all of our services across the region in preparation for more employees ing to work. He thanked customers for their cooperation and urged passengers to do their best to follow the seating advice as the trial gets underway. Mr Freeman added: “We continue to regularly clean all touch points on our buses and our drivers are supplied with protective equipment such as disposable gloves.  “NHS advice is also displayed on our buses reinforcing the need for passengers to follow Government guidance,” he added. He said First Bus was seeing a ‘small rise’ in numbers of passengers on some routes, and the firm was starting to put back buses that had been cut because of the lockdown.

Ryley Ferguson, , was on his daily walk with his two dogs when he spotted the -month-old in the water near his home in Knottingley, W Yorks. The quick-thinking teenager threw his shoes and coat off to grab the toddler as he sank to the bottom of the canal. Now Rebecca Hampton, , the relieved mum of rescued boy Reggie Johnson, has hailed Ryley as her ‘ Angel’....and is backing calls by locals to give him a Mirror Pride of Britain award. Ryley did not hesitate when he knew Reggie’s le was on the line.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at  www.mirror email “I’m just so happy I was there and managed to e in, in time to save him,” he said. “I didn’t have time to think, I was just on my walk with my dogs when I saw him fall in. I took my shoes and coat off - it was pure instinct at that point. It all happened in a split second. Suddenly I was at the bottom of the canal and managed to grab him. I was pretty calm but the water was so cold,my heart was racing. “In the end all that mattered was that he was okay. If I walked by just thirty seconds later, he could have died. I had to save him.” Ryley struggled to get out of the canal as he was holding the toddler, but two men raced to pull him clear as he shouted for help. Once they got out, little Reggie began to cry but Ryley says the tot calmed down after he reassured him, saying, ‘don’t worry, I got you’. Rebecca was reunited with her son just moments later. She had been working in the garden, and her adventurous little boy had wandered into the canal which runs behind their home.  The single mum-of-two, who also has daughter Petal, four, says the families now share a “bond for le” and Reggie will grow up knowing what Ryley did. “I keep saying Ryley is ourangel, he saved my boy and saved my le,” she added. “Reggie will grow up knowing who Ryley is and what he’s done. He’s our superhero.” A neighbour had rushed into our house and said Reggie was in the canal. “The world stopped for me at that moment, I was in complete shock,” Rebecca recalled. “I started shouting for him, it must have been a couple minutes at most but it felt like an eternity. I can’t tell you the relief when I saw my beautul boy. I can’t thank Ryley enough, I gave him a card with some money but no money in the world will ever cover what he’s done for me.”  Rebecca added that her son had suffered no ill effects - though she washed him in the sink at first to avoid the trauma of a bath. He is so fast for his age, I was busy in the garden so I did not see him, she said. I cannot thank Ryley enough, I nominated him for Pride of Britain, I think he really does deserve it. Ryley’s mum, care home cook Amy, was at work at the time of the rescue and couldn’t believe what happened. Amy, who is married to Michael, would love to see her son get a Pride of Britain award. It is lovely that so many people have nominated him, she said. Weaposre very proud of him. He saw Reggieaposs feet disappearing in the water. It is a good job he saw him, any later and they would not have had any idea where he was.

Other signs youaposre impressing your boss include having a comprehensive to-do list, getting in early and staying late, and offering to go to endless meetings. The poll of , office workers also found eight in  of those polled think they toil as hard as they possibly can, every single day. One in three do so because they respect their boss, and the same amount just love their work - while  per cent aposthriveapos on being busy. The research, commissioned by working animal charity SPANA, found six in  adults think those in the medical or healthcare field work harder than anyone , as shown by the weekly applause across the nation.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at  mirror email  -after the press conference every evening. Nurses were deemed to have the hardest job in the country, followed by doctors, paramedics - and police officers. Other jobs people believe are harder than any others include farmers, prison wardens and social workers. Just under one in  think traffic wardens have the hardest job in the country, while  per cent think sewage workers work harder than anyone . Geoffrey Dennis, chief executive of SPANA, which provides free veterinary treatment to working animals in developing countries worldwide, said: It will come as no surprise that nurses, doctors and paramedics are among those deemed to have the hardest jobs in the country, especially during the very dficult times we are currently facing as a nation.  In general, most Brits think they work hard each day - and most people are very dedicated in their professional lives. However, thankfully, our working conditions in the UK are usually good and labour laws exist to protect workers. Sadly, itaposs a very dferent situation for working animals overseas, which endure gruelling working conditions every day. These working horses, donkeys, camels and elephants toil for long hours, carrying backbreaking loads, with little rest and no holidays or retirement.  The study also found  per cent of adults think firefighters have the hardest job in the country, while a quarter believe social workers have it toughest. However, while the majority of those polled believe themselves to be hard workers, only four in  think they work harder than everyone  they know. Around  per cent of the working population believe they work over and above their working hours every day of the week. And six in  think they deserve much higher pay than they get, for the amount of effort they put in.  But seven in  full-time employees find their job much more mentally demanding than exacting a physical toll, while a fth think the work they do is equally taxing in their mind and their body. Geoffrey Dennis added: For the most part,we feel weaposre working too hard we can have a screen break, take some annual leave, or stop for a cup of tea. Most people have colleagues they can turn to on tougher days to help pick them up too. However, there is little or no support on offer for working animals and their owners in the worldaposs poorest communities.

Royal fans revealed on social media that at very close inspection there is a white sticker with black writing that says Archieaposs Book Club.

One woman said: Most likely a gt from Oprah, she is known to give her friends who just had babies a bookcase filled with books that says it’s their book club. Prime example is Mindy Kaling.

Archie is wearing a white t-shirt and a nappy, while Meghan looked casual and relaxed in a blue shirt and shorts. Archie gets involved straight away and starts turning the pages, but he gets a bit overexcited and keeps turning quicker than mum Meghan can read. There is a moment where it sounds like he might be about to start crying, but heaposs soon distracted by the book. As Meghan tries to get him to focus on the pictures on the page, she lets slip her adorable nickname for her little boy. She says: Letaposs go to the next page, look Arch.  It works a treat, and Archie immediately turns back to the page sheaposs looking at. The cute moniker was the inspiration behind Meghan and Harryaposs upcoming non-profit project, which they will call Archewell, derived from the Greek word for “source of action”. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are understood to be working on plans to run emotional support groups and even a multi-media educational empire.  After reading the next sentence about duck noises, Meghan quacks in Archieaposs ear and Harry does the same from behind the camera.

Meghan starts to take it off him, but he drops it on the floor instead, to which Meghan says uh-oh.  She picks it up again, whispering: shall we get the book back, weaposll read this one next, before carrying on. But Archie has clearly changed his mind and picks it up and throws it on the floor again. Meghan smiles straight into the camera as Harry tried to contain his giggles.

But now she uses her psychic abilities to give advice to the rich and famous. When Claire Stone’s phone buzzes with a message from model Tanya Bardsley or TV presenter Lizzie Cundy, she’s not surprised. Her contacts list is packed with stars from The Real Housewives Of Cheshire and The Only Way Is Essex. They rely on Claire to provide them with psychic readings and answers to their le ­questions. And when she’s not helping celebrities with their burning issues, Claire is teaching others how to ­connect with spirit guides through her workshops and courses. It’s a far cry from the poverty and uncertainty the -year-old faced when she grew up in Merseyside. From the age of two she lived with her mother and grandparents, after her dad left. Her grandparents died in her early teens, and when her mum became unwell Claire ended up becoming a young carer for her two-year-old twin sisters. “When I was  I was left to raise my sisters,” says Claire, who still lives in St Helens, Merseyside, with her husband John and daughters who are  and eight. “I was out of school looking after them. But I also had agoraphobia, which meant I struggled to go outside. “Sometimes social services would bring us beans and sacks of spuds, but I really think we slipped through the net.” Despite her mental health problems and unstable home le, Claire did have one thing she could rely on – her gt of talking to angels. “I’ve always been able to see angels but it wasn’t until I was about six that I realised my cousins didn’t have the same experiences as me,” reveals Claire. But her family were strict Christians who attended church every week.  “The vicar would say it was the devil’s work,” says Claire. As she grew older she struggled mentally. “I thought I was cursed because I had such a hideous le.” It was then, Claire says, she started to connect with an angel called Archangel Ariel. Ariel would come to Claire at night and she would hear her voice as a thought. “She started telling me how to cure my anxiety,” says Claire. She also had a deck of tarot cards and at  started doing readings for her friends. Now Claire has built her career around giving readings and teaching others to connect with their angel and spirit guides. “People often come because they are in two minds about relationships or careers. They have questions, like they are thinking of moving to a new country.”Claire has plenty of success stories to recount, most notably when Big Brother star Lisa Appleton was down on her luck."},{"url":null,"title":"rhys jones family slam teen","story":"NewsRhys Jones family slam teen killers attempt to cut sentence for shooting boy, Sean Mercer was jailed for the murder of Rhys Jones in Liverpool and was sentenced in  to a minimum of  years in prison, but he is now trying to reduce his sentenceShareCommentsByLuke Traynor:,  MAY NewsSean Mercer was jailed for the murder Rhys Jones in  \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Sean Mercer was  when he murdered the popular -year-old child who had just finished football practice in . Rhys was an innocent victim amid a crime war between gun-toting rival gangs in Croxteth and Norris Green in Liverpool. Mercer was jailed in  and ordered to serve at least  years, meaning his earliest release date was , at the age of .He was a prominent member of the notorious Croxteth Crew gang, and is now attempting to reduce his jail term, Liverpool Echo reports.His lawyers are set to argue he should be entitled to a sentence reduction because he was a juvenile, aged , when he murdered Rhys nearly  years ago. Under law in England and Wales, juveniles are entitled to a review of their minimum tarf, halfway through their sentence, now applicable to Mercer given he has served  years. But Mercer was convicted and sentenced when he was , having become an adult, so his appeal may stand on shaky ground. Steve and Melanie Jones, Rhysapos parents, were alerted to a possible legal challenge by their sonaposs killer in recent months. Probation Service bosses asked them to compose a victim impact statement, detailing the devastation Merceraposs actions had caused, and why they objected to his latest jail bid. Their account was written and sent off, but the Jonesapos have not heard anything further. Steve told Liverpool Echo : Weaposre not happy Mercer is doing this.Heaposs got his sentence and he had a fair trial. Heaposs just trying to get out as soon as he can, he should serve his full -year tarf. You read certain things that Mercer is a changed person, but like the others in his gang have proved, theyaposve been in more trouble since Rhys was killed. I donapost think heaposs changed. He added: These updates about how one of them is trying to challenge things, it brings Rhysapos murder back to us all the time. Mel gets these phone calls and it takes her back to the car park when she went to find Rhys all those years ago. Once lodged, Merceraposs application would be heard at the High Court.  It is understood it is yet to be lodged, but those close to him have been working on the appeal, and it could be filed soon. Tarf reductions will only be grantedthe court feels the offender has made exceptional progress whilst in prison. If Merceraposs appeal was successful, he would still need to apply to the Parole Board to considerhe was fit to be released.  Mercer shot Rhys outside the Fir Tree pub in Croxteth Park before leaving the scene on his mountain bike and going on the run. His gang accomplice James Yates supplied the Smith and Wesson gun used to shoot Rhys before helping him to dispose of his bike, clothes and the firearm he gave him minutes before the murder. Last month, it was revealed how Yatesy had been released from jail, having served the  year sentence for possession of a firearm and assisting an offender. Mercer chose to run an -week trial at Liverpool Crown Court, denying the murder, but was found unanimously guilty. Mr Justice Irwin delivered withering sentencing remarks to him and his fellow gang members, explaining how they were not the soldiers they claimed to be. The judge told Mercer and his cohorts: You have no discipline, no training, no honour. You do not command respect. You may think you do, but that is because you cannot tell the dference between respect and fear.

Unions have warned teachers of Section  of the Employment Rights Act , which protects an employee’s right to withdraw from a workplacethey believe it is unsafe. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: The overriding concern is that any decision is underpinned by public health and scientic advice that the timing is right, and that there is clear guidance to schools and colleges on the measures which will need to be put in place to protect staff and pupils from the risk of infection.  It will be necessary to build confidence that it is safe toto schools, because otherwise parents will vote with their feet, and they will not send their children to school. For all these reasons, we would urge that any date is kept under review, and thatmore time is needed then the date is changed accordingly. The NASUWT teaching union has said the Government needs to give “clarity about the purpose of reopening schools”, and schools need “much more detail and sufficient time to enable them to prepare”.

Whilst some people add cream, or butter, to the potatoes Rob Nixon - who is hailed as Australiaaposs Gordon Ramsay - has a slightly dferent tip for creating mash which is creamy, smooth and packed with flavour. He uses the potato skins... Yes, thataposs right. Now usually, most of us throw the skins away as soon as theyaposre peeled - but not anymore. In a video shared to his TikTok channel, Nickoaposs Kitchen, Rob explained that in order to make the best potatoes, you must soak the skins in simmering milk. He said: This will allow the flavour of the skin to infuse into the milk. Rob starts by peeling his potatoes - he recommends using a floury white-flesh potato and then sets them aside for later. He then cuts the potatoes in half, and cooks in lightly seasoned boiling water for - minutes, or until tender.  He continues by draining the potatoes and popping them into a potato ricer over a sieve.  Rob says pushing the potatoes through the ricer will remove all of the lumps - butyou donapost have one he suggests using a hand masher. After seasoning with salt and pepper, he adds softened butter and mixes well. Over a high heat he adds his milk and the potato skin, and allows them to heat for two minutes. Rob then strains the milk and mixes with the potatoes. And voila - creamy potatoes.

However South Korean intelligence services say Kim never underwent surgery, and was instead anxious about Covid-.

But the lawmaker said Kim has only made  public appearances so far this year, compared with an average of  from previous years.

For most of April the North Korean despot was no where to be seen.

Then suddenly Kim appeared at a fertiliser factory seemingly in good health. Footage and photos of his walk around have not proved enough to quiet some of the more fervent sceptics however. Some have suggested that a body-double is standing in for the dictator, while others have argued that he was absent for a period of post-plastic surgery rehab.  Online sleuths have put the spotlight on Kimaposs wrinkles, teeth, nose, ears and hairline to suggest something is amiss. One photo seems to show the leaderaposs teeth looking straighter and whiter than before. There have been suggestions that the photo was doctored, or that Kimaposs teeth have been altered via a relatively simple proceedure. His earlobes have also been scrutinised, because of the way they seemingly no longer attach to his head with a smooth curve.As for his altered hairlines, it has been suggested that this may have been achieved by a skilled barber. If Kim has been replaced by a body double, it would not be the first time. In  he was pictured alongside two look-alikes wearing matching black suits while at a missile launch. It has been suggested that he travels with body doubles in a bid to foil assassination attempts. Further adding to the mystery, Kim was missing from a ceremony in which Russia was due to award him a medal to mark the th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany.

So, we had to put out another statement.“You know how I am, I don’t talk about players# contracts, I don’t do things like that because I don’t think it’s appropriate at the time because you are negotiating. You can’t do that in the public eye because it’s not beneficial for the football clubyou do it that way.“We talked about it and I could see why the fans were concerned.“Honestly, I’m not surethe fans can see it or not but we are doing whatever we can do for the best of the football club, always.

will be losing more than we will.“The government has really stepped in and helped out the mid-sized to lower-end clubs.“At the bigger clubs with the salaries the players are on, although the furlough helps, it doesn’t help a huge amount.“I would say Dundee Football Club and others around the size of our club are at a pucker point where it really helps us out and it helps out clubs below us but above it won’t help out as much.“We’re OK at the moment but we don’t know what is going to happen.”Despite not knowing when the next campaign will be, fans have already been putting money into the

united","story":"Mal Brannigan’s exit from Tannadice on Friday night was a surprise – for the first time in Mark Ogren’s reign there are some uncomfortable questions to answer.It did appear like a bolt out of the blue, Brannigan had been interviewed in this very paper just the day before he left his role as managing director.A sudden departure for a club’s managing director raises questions over what is going on behind the scenes.There are obvious issues there, evenwe don’t really know what’s brought about the decision to part company.The manner of the club in dealing with the Dundee United Supporters’ Foundation raised some suspicion a couple of weeks back.It came across as an extreme reaction to a fan group looking to hand over a serious sum of money they had raised.To blacklist them so publicly was a very strange move.That was the first time there had been anything other than positive news coming out of the club since the Ogrens took over.Brannigan’s departure coming so soon afterwards makes it dficult to think anything other than they are linked in some way.Like the rest of the fans, I am on the outside looking in.But it doesn’t seem like everything is as rosy behind the scenes as we’d been led to believe.That doesn’t mean there’s a scandal waiting to be uncovered but a bit of clarity from the club in what’s been going on would be good.Fallings out and disagreements behind the scenes tend to happen when things aren’t going so well on the pitch.That’s what has jarred so much about this past couple of weeks at United.The club are in such a good place, they’ve won the Championship and are gearing up for the Premiership next season.Money has been invested in the first team, the academy and certainly around the stadium.The Ogrens’ reign has been pretty much positive right the way through.The sort of questions this last fortnight has brought about will be unwanted ones from their point of view.It’s certainly not the kind of attention the Americans or those involved with running the club want or need right now.I just hope it’s not an indication there are problems at Tannadice.Until we hear more from the club, all United fans will be concerned about that scenario.Just like everyone , I was keen to hear John Nelms’ viewpoint on the SPFL voting farce last month.I thought he came out of the interview in the Tele very well.I agree with him that Dundee were stuck between a rock and a hard place – being third they would be unlikely to go up in any league reconstruction.Any benefit would be a longer-term thing where they’ll likely be in a good position for promotion to the Premiership in the new set-up.You could feel the frustration in Nelms from his quotes about the position he and Dundee had been left in by the SPFL.I actually felt quite bad for him over the way it had all been handled by the powers-that-be.You could tell he was holding back on what he thought of Inverness and the leaked WhatsApp messages, too!Nelms came across well and made a good point about Rangers – the vote didn’t even concern the Gers directly so why did the fans all go crazy at Dundee The football world never ceases to amaze.Tommy Wright did a great job at

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering key workers in inveraray","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsInveraray#s war memorial was lit up blue this week in tribute to the work being done by NHS staff and other key workers during the coronavirus crisis.The tribute was organised by Inveraray#s branch of the Royal British Legion Scotland.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

But I have lost my job and can’t afford to feed my kids right now.’ You could tell that he was absolutely mortied and so humble. So many people have lost their jobs.“We have told pensioners not to answer their door when we deliver, but one old lady insisted. We told her she shouldn’t be doing that, but she replied: I just want to say thank you’.“The older generation are so apologetic when asking for help, they all say: I’m sorry to bother you’.”Christian charity Via Wings is offering food deliveries and befriending to anyone who is self-isolating, elderly, vulnerable, an NHS employee, key workers, or those financially impacted by Covid-.Volunteers observe social distancing guidelines and food is carefully wiped down before being packed. Food and toiletry donations can be made at Eurospar, Supervalu and Vivo in Dromore and Tescosand Lidl in Banbridge.Via Wings works with local schools and churches, social workers, care workers and other agencies.“Working in unity is what our grandparents used to do, and that is what we need to get back to doing, caring for each other,” Gail added.“There is no ownership, we are just working together.”CASE STUDYNEIL MUSGROVEPicture# NEIL MUSGROVE SUBMITTED BY LEEDS CARESAN ULTRA-MARATHON runner is putting his best foot forward after several running events planned for this year had to be cancelled or postponed.Last year Neil Musgrove ran seven ultra-marathons and with none looking likely for this year he is running one in his back garden.He is doing a mile a day in his back garden according to his running watch and is hoping to reach his goal of the  mile starting distance for an ultra marathon by the end of April.For every mile completed, Neil is donating £ to Leeds Cares and hopes that friends and family will join in with the challenge at their own homes and donate after every mile completed.He said: “With no ultra-marathons to run I thought I’ll run one of my own. Any experience I’ve had with Leeds Hospitals in the past has been positive, I want to support all of our amazing NHS staff who are currently under huge pressure and working in extremely tough circumstances.“It is quite a few laps.

Since then, the number of volunteers has hit  although extra help remains welcome.Government guidelines mean the volunteers can leave their homes to help a vulnerable person and, with almost every volunteer already assigned to an inidual, more support is likely to be needed in the weeks ahead.The idea has been well received by those who live in the Stenhousemuir and Larbert areas and beyond, so much so organisers opted to branch out and ease the strain on mums and dads by collecting and distributing school lunches purchased by Larbert High School to youngsters stuck at home.Pupils from Larbert High and its cluster primaries are benefitting from the move.On just one day last month, volunteers delivered more than  meals to schoolchildren.Stenny chairman Iain McMenemy, who helped to organise the initiative, said: “We put out a few requests for further volunteers and the response to each has been really encouraging.“We’re doing one-to-one tasks for people like dog walking and shopping and we’re putting in calls to make sure they’re okay.“The advice was clear:you’re going out for your own shopping,you have to go to work,you’re going out for one bit of exercise oryou’re helping a vulnerable person you’re able to go out, particularly because some people have got nobody .“We have even had members of family from farther afield saying they have a relative in the area and they want to give you a call.“We’re still looking for volunteers as we’re only in week three and the smart money is probably on this being extended for three months. We’ve also expanded out to do school meal deliveries for a number of the schools. Carron Bathrooms got in touch and offered two vans so we now have three. On top of that, we’re doing deliveries for Falkirk Foodbank.”Though Stenny officials admitted concerns over the impact COVID- would have on the club itself, their focus has always been on the “health and well-being” of the community.When the community help initiative was first announced, Mr McMenemy wrote in a statement: “With the continuing spread of the coronavirus, Scottish football faces an uncertain future.“It is quite clear that there will be a signicant impact on football operations and finances and Stenhousemuir Football Club will no doubt be affected by this.“However, there are other, more important matters to think about. The coronavirus is a very serious disease that will affect thousands within our communities.“The health and well-being of friends, neighbours and members of our community should be our top priority.”CASE STUDYHARRY RAGLESSSTAR MAN: Steve in his dramatic outfit.A BOY with spina bida and his father are both doing their bit for the community # but in completely dferent ways.Harry Ragless usually spends  per cent of his time in a wheelchair due to his condition, which means his spine did not form properly in the womb and he has neurological damage to his legs and back and cannot feel his feet.But inspired by the efforts of -year-old war veteran Captain Tom Moore, which have seen him raise around £million for the NHS, Harry decided to raise money by walking with his frame and leg supports.The determined six-year-old from Oaksheath Gardens in Durrington, near Worthing, has raised £, and rising within days of his parents launching a fundraising page for his efforts # smashing his £ target.He said: “I feel really good. I was shocked.”His proud mother Selina Ragless said: “He has shocked us all. Because of his condition he tires easily but the other day he walked from our house to Vancouver Road, which is really far for him. We couldn’t believe it.”As word of his exploits spread, Selina said people were coming out of their homes to applaud Harry, who attends West Park School in Marlborough Road, Goring, when he went out for a walk.She said: “I feel overwhelmed to be honest. We owe the NHS so much they have been there for him since he was born and will be there for him for the rest of his le. If we can give something back, that is all we want.”In fact, Harry’s exploits grabbed the attention of Captain Tom himself # and his picture was featured on the Second World War veteran’s Instagram page.Harry is not the only person in his family who is raising a smile in the community.By day, his dad Steve is a warehouse manager # but during his daily walk, he dons his Stars Wars outfit to bring a bit of fun to the neighbourhood. The -year-old said: “I love it. From my own experience, I remember the first Comic-Con I went to in Birmingham and I saw all these stormtroopers standing outside, and I went into full fanboy mode.”The opportunity for him to get his own suit arose when a friend was selling theirs.He said: “When I finally put it on, I just felt amazing in it. I love seeing the looks and smiles, and people tooting their car horns and waving. It brings a few smiles in these very strange times.”Selina came up with the idea for him to wear it after they were put in lockdown, and during their walks around the estate Steve has posed for ‘socially-distant’ photos with some of the children who have come out to see him.In his spare time, Steve has donned the costume to a iety of events, including birthday parties, weddings and charity events.When the Connaught Cinema has done showings of Star Wars films, Steve has turned up in his gear to raise money for Sussex Association for Spina Bida and Hydrocephalus, a charity which has helped Harry.When askedthere was anything he wanted to say to the people who have donated so far to his campaign, Harry said: “Thank you.”To donate, visit justgiving. com fundraising selina-ragless.Nominate a community heroDo YOU know a volunteer who deserves to be recognised for making a change in their community The Prime Minister recognises one person a day with a Point of Light award.Read more or nominate someone at www.pointsoflight.gov.uk "},{"url":null,"title":"sad ending for ardfern","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPuffer enthusiast and reader David Wright, who grew up in Bellanoch and now lives in Largs, sent in this photograph of the #Ardfern# puffer taken in the early s.Ardfern sank entering the canal locks at Crinan.

outbreak.It is estimated that the public is collectively owed about pound billion from travel firms.Forced instead to turn to their banks for help, many customers have now been told they are not eligible for a refund.Heres what you need to know.Why arenrsquot travel firms giving refunds Consumer watchdog Which  recently revealed that  of the UKrsquos largest airlines and travel firms are illegally withholding refunds which should be paid to customers within  days.Instead, most customers have been offered vouchers or credit notes, with many complaining that they have been unable to claim a refund online, or get through to customer services on the phone to ask for their money back.Should I ask my bank for a refund Customers who have been refused a refund by travel firms and paid for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos chargeback rights Mastercard said there is a chargeback right where firms have cancelled goods or services, even where this is due to government restrictions, insolvency or other exceptional circumstances.It is also validthe cardholder doesnrsquot wish to accept the firmrsquos offer to rebook or claim a voucher, but the issue should first be attempted to be resolved with the firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not provided.However, Visa does make an exception where firms have failed to provide a service due to a government-imposed travel ban, stating that this ldquosupersedes Visa rules on dispute rights.For this reason, Mastercard customers are likely to be more successful when making chargeback claims for coronavirus-related cancellations.If flights are cancelled due to closed borders, customers will still have a dispute right under both Mastercard and Visa, as EU-wide rules around refunds override the government travel ban, according to Which .Which banks will refund under Section  and chargeback Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster Bank, said cases would be considered on an inidual basis.If a claim made with the merchant in the first instance is not satisfactory, customers can contact Santanderto raise a claim.,params: .pushWhere the merchant has offered the chance to rebook for free and or provide vouchers and the customer is not satisfied with this then Starling Banksays it would initiate a chargeback.If a merchant is not offering a refund, or are asking customers to contact their card issuers to process a refund, Tesco Bankcustomers can raise a dispute.The Co-operative Banksays thatcustomers tried to resolve the issue with the merchant first but there was no refund or resolution, the bank would look at each case inidually to verya dispute chargeback right existed. If a chargeback right existed but the cardholder accepted a credit voucher, this would not affect the cardholderrsquos original dispute rights. The bank would also not reject a Section  claim outright in these circumstances.If customers are offered a voucher or a chance to rebook, TSBwould typically accept the claims and each case will be considered inidually.If the customer is unhappy with the solution offered by the merchant, Virgin Moneywould consider the terms and conditions.

A report is expected by mid-May.Pub chain Wetherspoonrsquos has said it plans to reopen its bars and hotels in June and said that due to it having larger than average pubs social distancing measures could be applied.RetailMinisters are thought to be considering allowing some non-essential businesses to open, such as garden centres and car showrooms, provided social-distancing could be maintained.Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has produced guidelines on how stores could prepare for the easing of restrictions.The guidance draws on lessons learned from supermarkets in recent weeks to ensure the re-opening of non-essential firms can be done safely.Advice coverslimiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.SportIt is understood Culture Secretary Olive Dowden has been working on a plan for major sports to be played behind closed doors when some social-distancing rules are eased.Weekly meetings are to be held between the Government, Public Health England and medical officials from sports bodies, with the issue due to be on the table when ministers review current measures next month.Key questions that need to be tackled include testing requirements, burdens on emergency services and the possible impact on fan behaviour ndash such as impromptu gatherings outside grounds.Sporting bodies are understood to be keen to resume full training safely as soon as possible.TravelLast week, low-cost European carrier Wizz Air announced plans to resume some flights from Luton Airport on May .Cabin crew will be required to wear masks and gloves on all flights and will distribute sanitising wipes for passengers, while new distancing measures will also be introduced during boarding.Mr Raab has indicated that officials are looking at possible checks at air and sea ports, with passengers arriving in the UK required to quarantine for  days.Meanwhile, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was ldquozero chance of ramping up transport services soon, amid speculation of an increase on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due.Last week, industry sources said no dates have yet been agreed or announced."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-can-turn-help","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at five of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port SetonTHE resilience effort in Cockenzie and Port Seton has been helping launch a Fair Share hub at the Port Seton Centre this past week.The charity Fair Share delivers surplus food from supermarkets to the centre every Friday.The hub will cover the whole of East Lothian and support the centrersquos existing work to provide hot meals and food packs to families in need and children who would usually receive free school meals.Bryan Hickman, chairman of the local community council, which is leading the resilience effort, said: ldquoWe are still delivering food to those who need it but the Fair Share hub has been set up.ldquoWe receive food like coffee, cereal, milk and biscuits but this could change every week.ldquoItrsquos really good news that we have set this up as it will help us give other types of food.

It is better known as a way of cocooning infants through the immunisation of close family members against disease.The team from Edinburgh University, Imperial College London, and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have modelled a range of scenarios to illustrate how dferent restrictions could be applied to dferent groups.They show \"the effects on the epidemic curve of a gradual ramping up of protection for the vulnerable population and a gradual ramping down of restrictions on the non-vulnerable population over a period of  weeks after lockdown\"Their findings have been made available to the UK and Scottish Governments.The strategy involves segmenting the population into dferent risk groups, based on a personrsquos medical history and potential healthcare needs.: Scotlands death rate from Covid likely to be lower than rest of UK due to lockdown timingAs a result, younger healthy adults and children, as well as over-s without any ailments associated with an increasedrisk from Covid,would resume something closer to normal le.Those most at risk - who currently fall within the shielded category - would continue to stay at home, with the added safeguard of targeted virus screening.They write: \"Intensive screening would, ideally, include daily checks for symptoms, daily tests for virus presence , regular serological [antibody] testing and monitoring of frequent contactsof shielders.\"If too large fraction of the population were to be classied as lsquoshieldersrsquo this would quickly overwhelm current testing capacity in the UK.\"Nonetheless, routine rapid testing of shielders could have a signicant impact and further increase the scope for relaxing restrictions on the entire population.\"Researchers say lockdown restrictions could be eased for most people, as long as sufficient public health measures stay in place to keep transmission rates low.These would include self-isolation of people with Covid-, quarantining affected households, contact tracing and voluntary social distancing.The most vulnerable ndash the frail elderly and those with underlying medical conditions such as cancer, heart or respiratory diseasesndash would still need to be shielded from contact with anyone potentially infected with the virus.To achieve this, people sharing a house with a vulnerable person, care workers and health professionals would need to protect themselves from infection.However, the risk to the rest of the population could be managed without resorting to lockdown.Asked about a potential \"two-tier approach\" to leaving lockdown, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said policymakers had to weigh up \"the fairness or potential unfairness\" of any approach.\"Is it fair  The judgement might be yes, it is, because we cant allow the quest for perfection to be the enemy of good progress. But we have to think about these things.\"None of us want to have a two-tier or a multi-tier society.\"The study stresses that the general non-shielding population will continue to be the \"main reservoir of infection\", therefore surveillance measures to contain the spread of the virus will be essential, say the researchers.They write: \"It is therefore vital that transmission rates are kept as low as possible, eventhis population is allowed to exit lockdown.\"Measures including self-isolation of cases, quarantining of affected households, contact tracing and voluntary physical distancing will be necessary to achieve this.\"In all our scenarios the vulnerable segment is subject to increased protection indefinitely. [Segmenting and shielding] is also more likely to succeedthere is less or no relaxation of restrictions on shielders.\"They say that contact tracing can include \"both traditional and app-based\" methods.However, the researchers caution that not enough is known about the build-up of immunity in affected populations and stress that this aspect of the epidemic needs to be monitored very closely.Dr Bram van Bunnik, Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Edinburghrsquos Usher Institute, said: ldquoEasing the measures taken during the lockdown is important as they currently have a tremendous effect on our society, but this should only be done in a way that is both safe for the people that are most vulnerable as well as for the health and safety of NHS staff.\"Segmentation and shielding is a possible way of achieving this: measures could be eased for a large proportion of the population, however the vulnerable population likely still needs to be protected for a prolonged period."},{"url":null,"title":"years-economic-scarring-predicted-young-workers","story":"A report published today by think tank The Resolution Foundation estimates that --year-olds will face years of economic ldquoscarring as a result of the outbreak with greater competition for jobs and lower wages for those who are employed.According to the independent research group, people without a university degree could be a third more likely to be unemployed years after the pandemic is over, with university graduates % more likely to be out of work three years after finishing their degrees.The analysis predicts that the labour market will be more dficult for young people entering it now compared to those entering it during the economic crash of .To help the thousands of young people likely to be affected, the Foundation is calling for the government to ensure apprentice schemes are boosted, and have recommended a fund to allow people to stay in education for longer, helping them to ldquoride out the economic recession set to hit after the pandemic eases.They have also suggested that special arrangements should be made to fund short courses at university and college, so it is easier for people to stay on for up to six months to boost their education and skills.Kathleen Henehan, research and policy analyst at the think thank, said: ldquoThe , young people set to leave education this year amid an unprecedented economic crisis are facing huge immediate unemployment risks, and longer-term damage to their careers.ldquoThe lsquocorona class of rsquo could face years of reduced pay and limited job prospects, long after the current economic storm has passed, unless the Government provides additional support ndash and fast.ldquoA new maintenance support scheme could help thousands stay in education and build-up their skills, while those entering the labour market for the first time should be supported by a Job Guarantee offering critical employment experience.The Foundationrsquos lsquoClass of rsquo report states: ldquoThe current crisis may reduce the employment chances of lower-skilled young adults leaving education by more than a third, even years down the line when the direct economic effects of the crisis willhave abated.ldquoFor those managing to find work, pay is expected to be depressed as well: two years on from leaving education, real hourly graduate pay is forecast to be, on average,  % lower.ldquoFor leavers with mid- and lower-level qualications, average hourly pay is forecast to be  and  per cent lower than  unemployment not risen, respectively.In comparing the coronavirus pandemic to previous economic recessions, in terms of the effects on young people leaving education, the report states ldquoPast recessions have left cohorts of lsquocrisis leaversrsquo with substantial scarring effect [in] both employment and pay...the depth of that scarring could be even worse this time around, given expectations for how the labour market will perform over the coming months.Alex Beer, welfare programme manager at the Nuffield Foundation, which funded the research, said: ldquoThe effects of the COVID- crisis are exacerbating existing inequalities and we are pleased to be funding this analysis which highlights risks to young peoplersquos job prospects.ldquoIt is important that the Government, higher education providers and employers act now to limit the long-term effects of the economic downturn, by creating opportunities for those entering work and training and supporting those who choose to stay in education."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Iain Macwhirter  Far from bringing the UK closer  Covid is pushing it further apart","story":"This pandemic has been nationalisms moment. Suddenly, people have realised why there are borders and what governments are there for: it is to look after their own. It is all about safety. When it comes down to it, other countries cannot make le and death decisions for you.It was the principle applied by Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand when she decided that, actually, globalisation sucks and its better to look after your own people, eventhis means closing the borders to foreigners. Yesterday she said the borders would not be reopened ldquofor a long time.It applies especially to small countries because they are generally forgotten when the chips are down. However, in Scotland, there has been a widespread belief that the reverse has been the case and that the pandemic has ldquotorpedoed Scottish nationalism as a Scotsman headline put it recently.Commentators insist that the United Kingdom has been reunited, as in wartime. ldquoThe British family has come together to look after each other, opined a romantic unionist in the New Statesman. Im not sure theres much evidence for this.The pandemic could equally be said to have demonstrated the opposite: that it is irresponsible in a crisis to remain tied to the United Kingdom, and to the politics of British Conservatism which this country has consistently rejected. Scots are certainly not enthused by Boris Johnsons record so far. Yet three quarters believe Nicola Sturgeon has done a good job, according to the latest opinion poll.Personally, I am extremely uncomfortable with all the talk of borders, but I cant ignore the argument that, had it been in control of them, a Scottish government could have attempted the elimination strategy so effectively deployed in New Zealand. Instead, the UK government kept the borders open and some , travellers a day continued to enter Scotland with scarcely any checks.Opinion: Teddy Jamieson: Government needs to deliver more than gesturesThe influential Devi Sridhar, professor of Global Health at Edinburgh University, believes thatScotland had implemented border controls early a policy of intensive testing might well have worked here. The Scottish death rate has been around half the UK figure, and Prof Sridhar thinks it could have been halted altogether. Yet, in line with the UK, the Scottish Government abandoned community testing and contact tracing in mid-March.Now, I dont subscribe to the view that Boris Johnson has allowed thousands to die in order to save his billionaire Brexit chums. The UK government behaved reasonably, according to its lights, muddling through as always. But many mistakes were made and there is certainly an argument that Scotland could have handled the crisis better on its own.There still seems to be an assumption in the UK media that big countries are better at handling crises like coronavirus than smaller ones. Precisely the reverse appears to be the case ndash the biggest countries like America, UK, Italy, have had a dismal record in managing the pandemic so far.It is not only remote antipodean nations like New Zealand that seem to have fared better. The country with the lowest number of deaths per million in the EU is Slovakia, which has a population similar to Scotlands. The wearing of masks was made compulsory there early in the infection.Slovenia, which borders on Italy, has also emerged largely unscathed. Most small states like Norway and Denmark seem to have managed the disease effectively. The outlier is Belgium which has had the worst headline death rate so far, partly because of its population density, and perhaps because the country which houses the European Commission has been the most open and ldquoborder-free.The true death rate league table, as the risk guru Sir David Spiegelhalter has pointed out, cannot be known until the pandemic is over. But there is pretty strong evidence that smaller countries do well. They seem able to move and adapt more quickly.

It would certainly start le with a budget deficit. Butthe pandemic has shown anything it is that large deficits can be managed.

Suddenly, people have realised why there are borders and what governments are there for: it is to look after their own. It is all about safety. When it comes down to it, other countries cannot make le and death decisions for you.It was the principle applied by Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand when she decided that, actually, globalisation sucks and its better to look after your own people, eventhis means closing the borders to foreigners. Yesterday she said the borders would not be reopened ldquofor a long time.It applies especially to small countries because they are generally forgotten when the chips are down. However, in Scotland, there has been a widespread belief that the reverse has been the case and that the pandemic has ldquotorpedoed Scottish nationalism as a Scotsman headline put it recently.Commentators insist that the United Kingdom has been reunited, as in wartime. ldquoThe British family has come together to look after each other, opined a romantic unionist in the New Statesman. Im not sure theres much evidence for this.The pandemic could equally be said to have demonstrated the opposite: that it is irresponsible in a crisis to remain tied to the United Kingdom, and to the politics of British Conservatism which this country has consistently rejected. Scots are certainly not enthused by Boris Johnsons record so far. Yet three quarters believe Nicola Sturgeon has done a good job, according to the latest opinion poll.Personally, I am extremely uncomfortable with all the talk of borders, but I cant ignore the argument that, had it been in control of them, a Scottish government could have attempted the elimination strategy so effectively deployed in New Zealand. Instead, the UK government kept the borders open and some , travellers a day continued to enter Scotland with scarcely any checks.Opinion: Teddy Jamieson: Government needs to deliver more than gesturesThe influential Devi Sridhar, professor of Global Health at Edinburgh University, believes thatScotland had implemented border controls early a policy of intensive testing might well have worked here. The Scottish death rate has been around half the UK figure, and Prof Sridhar thinks it could have been halted altogether. Yet, in line with the UK, the Scottish Government abandoned community testing and contact tracing in mid-March.Now, I dont subscribe to the view that Boris Johnson has allowed thousands to die in order to save his billionaire Brexit chums. The UK government behaved reasonably, according to its lights, muddling through as always. But many mistakes were made and there is certainly an argument that Scotland could have handled the crisis better on its own.There still seems to be an assumption in the UK media that big countries are better at handling crises like coronavirus than smaller ones. Precisely the reverse appears to be the case ndash the biggest countries like America, UK, Italy, have had a dismal record in managing the pandemic so far.It is not only remote antipodean nations like New Zealand that seem to have fared better. The country with the lowest number of deaths per million in the EU is Slovakia, which has a population similar to Scotlands. The wearing of masks was made compulsory there early in the infection.Slovenia, which borders on Italy, has also emerged largely unscathed.

No Tory roar, no Labour barracking, no Jezza.Instead, the witness for the Labour prosecution, the former Director of Public Prosecutions no less, was eagerly waiting to forensically unpick the PMrsquos arguments piece by piece.After the niceties about welcoming a virus-free premier back on the green benches, the Labour knight began his inquisition, which, of course, everyone expected.After quizzing Boris on the dreadful death-toll, now Europersquos highest, Sir K condemned how the UK had been slow into lockdown, slow on testing, slow on tracing and slow on the supply of protective equipment. Each reference pinged against the PMrsquos chin.Bozza admitted to ldquobitterly regretting the crisis in the care homes but insisted, to raised eyebrows, there had been a ldquopalpable improvement of late.

Since then, as the Prime Minister knows, the number has fallen back.

The testing seems to have worked reasonably well. Even I was able to do it, so it is relatively straightforward.\"He also pointed out any cyber-attack was a \"highly unlikely event\".But during Commons exchanges, the SNPrsquos Tommy Sheppard suggested that, rather than have a hybrid Parliament with some MPs in the chamber and others asking questions from home, there was a case for going fully digital.ldquoIt is now time to consider making use of the digital  to allow a fully virtual session of Parliament, declared the Edinburgh MP.ldquoI know that our staff have the expertise and the capability to make this happen. This would ensure there are not two classes of participant and all members, including yourself Mr Speaker, are playing on a level field.Mr Rees-Mogg responded by saying: ldquoWe have proceeded with almost unanimous consent to achieve a hybrid Parliament. We would not have done so had people thought this was a sleight of hand, a prestidigitation, to try to change our procedures on a permanent basis.

Could we get the website sorted so that people get the information that they need, rather than thinking that in order to get a test they have to first get a plane or a ferry ”Responding, the Secretary of State for Health, Matt Hancock MP, said: “It’s a very important question and I’ll look into the specics of it to make sure that our island communities get the appropriate response in the website. He’ll appreciate that we put the testing website together at a remarkable pace and so in the first iteration weren’t able to make this sort of important nuance for Orkney and island communities, but I’ll take that away and look at it.“He mentioned the answer to this in substance and the answer is to get the home testing kits working for Orkney [and Shetland] and I’m sure there’s a way through.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“I am glad that action will be taken to get this issue sorted. If key workers in the isles are not getting the testing that they need because they are getting inaccurate advice from official websites, that puts more people at risk and harms public confidence.“Island communities could benefit greatly from more access to home testing kits for key workers.

It was announced yesterday that the Scottish Government would pass this funding along in full to Scottish councils.Council leaders appealed to the Scottish Government through COSLA, which represents local authorities in Scotland, to give the funding directly to Scottish councils immediately to help them provide essential services at a time when costs are increasing signicantly and income has dropped substantially due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.Speaking following yesterday#s announcement, councillor Stockan said: “The announcement from the Scottish Government has shown the value in council leaders working on a common cause together at a time of crisis to press the Scottish Government to give us the support we so badly need and deserve. The government’s eventual decision to bow to our pressure and pass this money on is a signicant victory for local government.“Much more support is needed for local services from the Scottish Government though.

Mr Russell’s comments come in the wake of the First Minister’s announcement of an expansion of testing.Following the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “There is an increasing level of public interest in the proposals put forward by Professor Pennington and Dr Allyson Pollock in recent weeks that the islands could start to ease lockdown restrictions sooner than mainland Scotland.“Such a strategy could only be adopted, however,a rigorous and extensive system of testing, tracing and isolating was firmly established. The First Minister’s announcement today of a further expansion of testing perhaps paves the way for such a system being put in place.“Public safety, of course, remains the priority and must underpin any decision taken in relation to how and when restrictions are eventually lted. That is true of our island communities as it is other parts of the country.“However, ministers must not discount possible options without proper consideration. I therefore welcome Mr Russell’s assurances that the government will engage actively and constructively in the debate about whether and how our islands might safely take the lead.“This is unlikely to lead to any quick decisions, not least as the stakes are so high. It is encouraging, however, that Ministers are prepared to keep an open mind over the coming week.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the interest of their renewable energy hobby horse, for years, they have done nothing to secure incredibly cheap gas supplies for local people and left no stone unturned in their lobbying for Viking Energy.

However I have no idea how I can add my contribution. Ryan can you help me out here and publish the link in the Shetland Times mailto:NTIMailbox@ofgem.gov.ukIt is not unreliablestored. This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property. I#m old enough not to care.To give a hand to each.#To leave the oyster-bed.#The sun#s shining here and like the old oyster, I can#t be bothered, either, John. Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting. What more could one ask for in this struggling , changed 🌎 world we occupy for a short time. Now Thorium nuclear is clean, no long half-le isotopes produced and no danger of meltdown.They are also neither cheap or reliable. Back up will also be requiredfor when the sun doesn#t shine or the wind isn#t suitable at more expense. More renewables will inevitably contribute to increased fuel poverty.Michael Moore # Planet of the Humans # a documentaryon the renewable energy scam that the left want banned # who would have thought !The more you look into the problem of energy supply against saving the environment, the more contradictory conclusion one gains. Wind and Solar maybe cleaner, but how much land and natural habitat being destroyedwould be required to power a city of several million##.and this is just  city     What energy source would be required alsothere are days of no sun or no wind. What backup technology would be in place, and would this also be clean energy  It seems ironically disturbing that cleaner energy through wind and solar, would also have a negative impact on the environmentyou take into consideration the polluting processes involved in the manufacturing of such devices.as well as the huge amount of land required , which would also be expanding as the population grows. I would assess cleaner energy via wind and solar would have a larger impact on the natural eco-systems and the environment and would still be reliant on fossil fuels. As far as I can see, disturbing as it may be, the only source for future energy demand is to go nuclear.And no , I am not a pessimistI’m a wary realist.Better than a blinkered optimist.Nuclear Energy does have its dangerous pitfalls, but we are already using this technology to generate electricity. I believe % of our electricity is produced by nuclear power  In France I believe this to be much higher  Although it may be dficult to assess the impact of solar or wind generators on the environment on a large scale, it would have to be balanced between the use of such technology to this of the environmental and eco-systems which maybe affected.I do not know how much land would be required to provide electricity to a city of several million, but I would hazard a guess it would be quite considerable  This use would also have to compete with farming and agriculture not to mention living space for housing etc etc.  from the shore would these wind turbines be  I suspect it would be quite close  Will our seashores be lined up with thousands of wind turbines I would also suspect the cost of such a scenario would be very high in adoption and maintenance.lol Hayden. Disturbing as it may be, I do not think we will have much option but to go nuclear. If it were a case of saving the environment and eco-systems, one may not have any choice We are already using this technology to produce electricity, andit is the case of minimizing our impact on the environment and eco-systems, then nuclear maybe the only way Cleaner energy may be, morally, more suited, but one must also take into consideration the impact on the environment and eco-systems and how this may change towards a negative once we realize the full influence of this compared to the potential benefits I cannot give any answers to what a large scale wind or solar scheme would be to power several millions homes, but I would suspect it would be considerably large in land area  One could use the same land for agriculture and farming and possibly housing  Shetland is suited for wind generating power schemes, but what would be the benefits to this of tourism, bird populations and property values, not to mention the visual impact of those people living near to such schemes and the consistent vibrating noise.Agriculture, farming and housing would not be adversely affected. Bird populations would be safe and tourists would be able to concentrate on spending their money which, after all, is the main reason for encouraging them to visit Shetland!! By the way,I have stood close to wind fed generators of the type we are discussing and never felt vibrations —- just the pleasant swishing sound of the rotating blades. Not too dferent from the soothing sounds of the sea.Haydn, You live in Crickhowell, Wales, nowhere near any large windfarms.The Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons on your doorstep. Just how close is your home to the #the pleasant swishing sound of the rotating blades  .# I really doubtyou can even see a -meter turbine from your home. On Shetland people would be living under them, they would be about  meters high on high hills  meters or so plus above our heads!!! The plan is for over.Another smaller series of wind turbines is even closer to me and they are sited near Ebbw Vale on The Tops as we in the lower valley area call them. From close first hand experience I still maintain that the swishing sound of the blades is pleasant and certainly not as fierce and noisyas anyof the many gale force winds on Shetland.Or does that apply just to those who are incomers from other places like England for example Where do you hale from Ian  Just wondering !Llanfoist is just a walk from Crickhowell, I walk that distance most days!!! !!

Those people can then undergo further tests with the hope of slowing the spread of the disease.Soon after the outbreak, however, the national response moved from the #contain# phase to #delay# and most contact tracing was halted.This week has seen itas a key part of the national strategy.The government announced yesterdaythat a new contact tracing app was going to be piloted in the Isle of Wight as part of the first phase of the #test, track and trace# programme.When someone reports symptoms through the app, it will alert other users whom the person has been in recent contact with. Those users will then be sent advice, including how to get a test.The app is hoped to ramp up contact tracing and reduce the spread of the virus.Mr Dickson said it  was an important part of the strategy # and he felt the Isle of Wight pilot could have useful implications for Shetland, which shares some similarities, as an island community.Although the Isle of Wight is closer to the mainland and has a larger population, it has a single health board and Mr Dickson said it faced many of the same challenges as Shetland.In order to be effective, however, the app needs a signicant proportion of the population to sign-up, which could pose dficulties in isolated communities such as Shetland, where connectivity is poor in some areas.There have also been concerns raised about data privacy.But Mr Dickson said he was optimistic that folk in Shetland would support the programmeand when it was rolled out locally.#I#ve always found the people of Shetland to be hugely positive at responding to these sorts of challenges,# he said.#I#ve got no doubt that they will do the same here.#Until the app is rolled out more widely, however, Shetland#s contact tracing programme will be along the traditional  methodology.#Right now the digital  is not available for us,# said Mr Dickson. # So it#s back to the grind stone and the hard work of checking where people have been.#Nationally, , staff have been recruited to help with the manual checking of people#s movements, as an alternative tracing programme for those who do not have access to a smartphone or good connectivity.Mr Dickson said that in Shetland, health workers who have been unable to perform their usual work, due to the Covid- crisis, such as dentists, would be ready to help with the programme.But although Mr Dickson said it was possible to carry out this method of contact tracing effectively in Shetland, he said it would be a #Herculean# task to do it on a national level requiring an estimated , staff.With the digital , he said much of that need for labour could be reduced.But while the contact tracing is a useful step forward, Mr Dickson said it must be considered as part of a wider picture.#I think it#s a really useful string to the bow of the wider orchestra that we need to overcome this,# he said.He highlighted the NHS#s work helping care homes and delivering PPE as other ongoing parts of its work fighting the virus. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"carmichael calls on pm to be guided by science over coronavirus ","story":"Criticism has been levelled against Boris Johnson’s lockdown exit strategy, with Shetland’s MP claiming the Prime Minister is coming under too much pressure from Conservative backbenchers.Alistair Carmichael says he fears the PM is failing to rely on scientic evidence which has so far guided measures taken to combat coronavirus.It comes after Mr Johnson signalled measures would be eased on Monday next week.Identying ways for businesses to get staff members back to work are among the possible areas for change.Meanwhile, the Scottish government has welcomed a fall in the rate of deaths linked to coronavirus north of the border.But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned progress against the virus was “too fragile” to “immediately ease restrictions in any meaningful way”.For his part, Mr Carmichael believes there may be “some opportunities” for relaxing restriction measures # but onlythe science backs that up.s: “Some of what I hear does worry me, because it looks to me assome of what they are talking about involves easing lockdown because they are getting pressure from their own backbenchers to do that.Coronavirus Disease  Graphic. “The question of how we manage lockdown has to be done on the basis of scientic evidence.”He added: “My worry is that the longer it goes on the more influence the economy and political considerations will make over scientic and medical ones.”Mr Carmichael added his priorities would be to get school children back in their classrooms and “as many local businesses as we can ing again for the benefit of the people who need local services”.“I think it’s probably unrealistic to expect that we’re going to have tourists coming back here for most of this season,at all, and I just think these are the areas where we feel lockdown the hardest.”He added: “I don’t think you’re going to get back to full schools from zero.

But with no likelihood of visitors coming to our place anytime soon, there is something slightly morose and sad about making the buildings and cabins look neat, well maintained and tidy.It all seems a bit soulless and Marie Celeste-like with no guests.While being locked down at home, being busy, fixing and decorating, and even dare I say it, having a good time with family, there is an emerging sense of frustration, even perhaps inadequacy.Others are out there being essential, being key workers and worthwhile, ‘fighting’ the virus, supporting the vulnerable, while I….make a patio.I think for many people, there is a need to feel useful, and it is perhaps why for me the motorbike ride is so important.While there is nothing heroic about delivering a few medicines, it gets me out of the house # we might have a big cabin, but it still induces a fever.Being part of a support network and involved in helping the community works both ways and fulfils a very real need in those helping.Perhaps everybody wants to feel essential.We can laud the NHS staff, care workers, shop assistants and delivery drivers, but no one is going to clap for the furloughed hospitality workers and idle outdoor instructors.As a volunteer, however, we can all feel that we are doing our bit.There is a huge grey area surrounding the concept of key worker and essential.At first glance, it may seem obvious as to who is key # doctors, nurses, carers and the like but then there are the people who support them.Key workers need paid, so require office staff. They need fed, so also use food shops.They need to get to work, so are likely to drive a vehicle, so they need fuel. Andthe car breaks down, they will need a mechanic.They need water and electricity and the internet, and might also need a treat delivered from a mail order company during their well-deserved down time.Then there are the people who support the people who support the people who support…and so on.And so there emerges a whole network of service providers, businesses large and small # a web of commerce and production.In order to provide for the frontline, a whole system of interrelated businesses exists, many which might not appear to be essential, but may provide a key element, a small cog in the big picture.In the short term key workers can perhaps get by, but society shouldn’t allow its critical people to just muddle through, as the lockdown period extends, then the need for this support becomes more evident and relevant, and so the web of essentiality widens.As more roles, jobs and links in society are realised and considered necessary, and indispensability spreads, recreation and tourism won’t get much of a look in.We could argue that people need to visit the Old Man of Storr for our economic well-being as much as for their own health and well-being, but for the time being the beds and hot spots will remain empty.So, in order to be relevant and useful, we should perhaps look to our other skills.If tourism is our only income then we have to be creative, not only to make provision but to keep spirit and self-actualisation alive.Economically,tourism is a second income, the icing on the salaried or pensioned cake, then perhaps we just take the hit, and revert back to a less affluent lestyle.Many tourist providers left skills and talents in a previous le, perhaps now is the time to revisit and reimagine those skills.As I understand it, Skye is still waiting.Perhaps by the time this column is online, the virus will be more evident, during this waiting game now more than ever we need to be physically distant, and careful with how we operate.But it is crucial that we also need to look after our mental health and well-being, and so delivering the prescriptions is really as important to volunteer as it is for the receiver.Humans are a social animal, and we need to be part of a community, because we are all essential.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/norrie-grandfather.jpg","title":"norrie t macdonald the cycle of the sea and island traditions of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAlthough Shinigeadh was our training pool as youngstersand probably today seems quite safe and relatively innocuous it was also my first introduction to the concept of ‘industrial’ fishing.was strictly for deployment only by the stronger adults.It consisted of a stf polefrom which was slung a netted hoop, around - feet in diameter.It was to our mini-bamboo rods, what the Broch purse-seiner was to the Scalpay ring-netter.There had obviously been a couple of nights where our amateur, one-at-a-time, efforts to procure a decent supper had been insufficient to adequately harvest the bounty on offer.I remember the bodach and both the uncles appearing with the borrowed ‘poc’, intrigued as to what purpose it could possibly serve.’.A couple of pocketfuls of just-about-right, newly boiled, potatoes were the secret weapon.The cuddies scattered as the ‘poc’ got lowered into the sea.Crushing a potato into small pieces and scattering on the surface elicited a frenzy of activity.The timing of the hauling of the ‘poc’ was crucial.A miss, and you could maybe only land a couple.A full hit and you might struggle to lt it out of the water at all, requiring a re-submersion.This could result in losing the lot, the elusive cuddy being much quicker than the second haul.It took the knotting of the legs and sleeves of one of the standard, adult, blue boiler suits to make a receptacle big enough to take that night’s catch home.It was the first time I observed the tradition of the ‘share’.Walking back through the village, it was like we were expected.Several caileachs came to their gate with a basin, each the recipient of half a dozen dozen fish, dependent on their familysize.It was a tradition Iain ‘Scud’ MacLeod, George ‘Baba’ Richards and myself continued as we graduated onto the big bamboo in Bayble School.They were my fishing buddies as we moved onto the next level in our adventures.The full bamboo rod required technique and balance.Especially when we moved further afield onto the more dficult fishing hot-spots. every night.We were careful not to take the prime spots lest we got a mouthful, but we were tutored and encouraged, warned about any pitfalls and certainly well chaperoned for our own education and safety.We moved further up towards the Tiumpan where the rocks were more daunting, each climb steeper and requiring a working knowledge of the way down.With a -foot pole and in wellies.’ were the favourites, not too tricky a climb and with deep water just off the inside-point. were reserved for night when we felt particularly brave or even simply when they hadn’t been claimed by the adults.They were prime locations, great fishing spots, but generally could only accommodate a single rod.’ were up at the Tiumpan itself and required the right combination of tides and prevailing wind to be accessible, safe and productive. .The big rod came with several dferent options.The flywhich mimicked sand eels, consisted of usually three, four or six hooks, depending on what you were after .It could be deployed with, or without, a weight on the end.’was an issue.In the deeper water, a ‘dandy’ was best. This involved far less effort, a simple up and down motion of the tip of the rod producing plentul yields.’, basin outstretched, every night we caught more than was our fill.We also, as we got more adventurous, took to a bigger, single, hook and a longer, single trace .Barring this, a rubber eel.We were moving up from cuddy to lythe.What a fright the first one gave me!Two pulls of almighty force, then ‘I give up’.Deadweight.The sense of yet another ‘graduation’ was palpable, but the lythe was no grand fighting fish.It marked another progression up whatever the fishing ‘ladder’ was.By this time we were regulars in the town and had had our introduction to Meg’s ‘Electro Sports’ shop.He had, to our limited experience anyway, a huge assortment of rods and tackle for us to gawp at.Naturally, we moved up to spinning rods, monofilament, lures, kosters and paternosters., in competitions to see who could be the first to ,  or even .Traumatised for an hour or so, they would get ed to the water as the sun began to set.With spinning rods we learned a completely dferent set of rules.What was deep  yards out and what was disaster for your tackle.How to tie a proper knot and which kit worked best for the conditions.How to unravel a reel-tangle with three mackerel on the line .The cost of losing gear was beginning to hit the pocket-money hard.The only real solution was to get better at making your own.You learned how to make your own trace # downy seagull feathers were better, but not as practical as sheep’s wool # and how to tie knots that never ‘slipped’.Graduating onto more ‘specialist’ fish and fishing became a challenge after years of cuddies, mackerel and lythe.Fancier bait lugworm, real sand eel, salted herring even, were meant to be great to entice the bottom feeders flounder, sole, gurnard, possibly haddock and lingyou could reach with a long cast.Ok, so we mostly caught dogfish and, like every single other thing we pulled up, handling one came with its own set of rules.Mackerel have a nasty wee ‘sting’ in front of their anal fin, a small protrusion of cartilage bone which can catch the unwary out.Gurnard require welding gloves and a lesser-spotted dogfish will try to wrap its tail around your arm and give you a nasty ‘Chinese burn’.Rub your fingers against the ‘grain’ of one’s scales next time you see one.It’s like rough sandpaper.Everyone’s ambition, however, was to get out on one of the village boats.We had grown up with Roddy Alec and ‘Saight’, the last proper village fishermen who plied their trade on the ‘Fisher Lass’ out of Portnaguran.The ‘Fisher Lass’ was a substantial wooden boat, somewhere between the privately owned ‘rowing’ boats # each one now had a Seagull, Mariner or Evinrude rather than rely on such menial propulsion # and the commercial trawlers.Hers was a serious purpose we just wanted some fun.Whilst the rocks could disappoint, we were brought up with the notion that being a quarter mile offshore must come with an assurance of plenty.There were boats on the Portvoller side as well.The trick was, in the absence of having a boat in the family, knowing someone who did and whose father uncle was prepared to take responsibility for you for a couple of hours.Three a side, with mackerel or herring running, was huge entertainment.It was, necessitated by space and safety, ato hand lines again and a degree of ‘back to basics’ which felt very raw..A fish meal factory, dependent mostly on locally caught sand eels, but which handled mackerel and pout when available it could stink out the entire town given the right conditions.My father would come home, not entirely fragrant, and I would rush to get the folded-up daily paper from his lunch box.There were days, especially in the height of summer, when I couldn’t get beyond the back page .Little did I realise, until many years later, the destruction caused by overfishing of the type to assault the senses so violently..Barryhad procurement of his uncle’s boat and we made an anchor out of an old engine, attached a buoy and plastic ring, then ran yds of mm, in a loop, to the shore.The rest, you might say, is piracy.All good fun until the fishery cruiser, possibly the ‘Minna’, I couldn’t comment, came along one morning and confiscated the net, cod ‘n’ all.Now this could have been a delicious irony.I referred last week to the passing down of genes through the generations.The son and ‘heir to fresh air’ was never a guy to show his hand early, certainly not while in school.We had no clue what career path he would decide on, his head, whilst not always in proximity, wascertainly edging closer to the clouds.“I’m going to sea Da, to do marine engineering”, he one day boldly announced.Luckily, no one had a feather handy.And that’s what he did.He qualied as a ship’s engineer.It shouldn’t have been too hard to figure out where this notion came from, however., MacIver was the Chief Engineeron the old Fishery Protection Vessel, “Minna”.It is indeed a tangled web.Years later I ended up, standing on several fish boxes in the mart in Stornoway, as a fish-salesman.In my apprenticeship, under George Prince Jnr, we oversaw the landing of tens of thousands of tonnes of sand eels to HBP.The fishery was devastated, almost entirely, by local vessels and a couplefrom Barra.But while the smell was awful, the money was fantastic for all those involved.As the years progressed, the main catch moved from fish to prawns.I could tell the dference between a dab, a plaice, a brill, a turbot, a halibut, a megrim and a witch, but saw increasinglyless and less of them each year.My good pal Stuart Keyte – the local fishery officer # and I bought a small, Orkney origin, ‘clinker’-built -footer to work some creels and have a bit of ploy.You can get used to two lobsters for breakfast.But only for a wee while.Despite HBP closing down and the fishery banned, the knock-on effects of overfishing, several stocks over several decades, were beginning to take their toll.I could go to the rocks for nights on end and catch nothing.As it was, I ended up on the rocks anyway.A spell clam fishing with John Murdo ‘Easdaidh’ MacLeod was my swan song.I loved it.We left the harbour every day at am and headed for, guess where Correct, the Tiumpan.As day broke we would haul the six dredges and he would get the frying pan on whilst I sorted the catch.I could see the lights in my house going on from half a mile at sea .We had two rolls each and a cup of coffee.A huge scallop, bacon, black-pudding and fried egg on each .“If they fit through the handle of the basket, throw them over” was the rule of thumb.I’m guessing we could have been inside ‘the limit’.I’ve never fished a Loch nor a river.Not remotely interested.Given my track record, I’d have probably used a bit of dynamite, certainly a bit of mono.Just for dramatic effect.Mother Nature, left to her own devices, is a truly wonderful thing.Stocks will, eventually, recover and, managed properly could give sustainable employment for years to come.Maybe even endless fun for kids who have got too accustomed and fed up, paralysed even, from the catatonic effects of lockdown.Remember what Dougie said to Para Handy ‘The herring in Loch Fyne comes in cycles’‘Ach man’, replied Macfarlane, ‘There wass herring in the Loch long afore the cycle was inventit’.Everything goes around folks.Remember it when you contemplate your next move.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EARIE-QUIRAING-5.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh an gobha ruadh agus domhnall an oir","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine..

We also reached out to our friends in Ahoghill Loyal Sons of William Flute Band and were delighted to be able to work with them to distribute over  care packages to some of the most vulnerable members of our community.Obviously thanks must go to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council for providing the grant and for the extremely fast turnaround throughout the application process, the club would also like to thank Maurice Cooper and the Ballee Discount Shop for helping us source the products. Thanks also must go to Galgorm LOL  who allowed us the use of their hall to make up the packages.But a huge amount of thanks and credit must go to the members of the club and the band for their attitude and desire to help their community despite the ongoing situation.It has been extremely encouraging to see so many examples of the loyal orders and bands coming to the forefront to help their communities and it serves to prove that our Institutions and Associations are about much more than parades!Mervyn Stirling, Bandmaster of Ahoghill Loyal Sons of William said: When we were first contacted by the club about the idea we agreed to it right away.We as a band had been trying to help our members and their families as best we could but this enabled us to take that level of support to another level. When distributing the care packages it was very apparent how grateful and appreciative people were, even just for us as a band to be thinking of them.Its not until youre on the ground can you fully appreciate just how isolated some people are during this period, so for us as a band to be able to help those people is fantastic.Wed just like to express our thanks to Ballymena and Harryville Apprentice Boys of Derry branch club for reaching out to us and giving us the opportunity to help our community.I think it shows perfectly what bands and loyal orders are all about, and thats helping their communities and being there for one another.

Each team has a target of walking a combined total of  miles – completed as part of their daily exercise routine – the distance between the College’s campuses in Coleraine, Ballymoney, Ballymena, Newtownabbey and Magherafelt.Jenny Small, Vice Principal, Performance and Development, who is overseeing the Volunteer Day explained: “Northern Regional College is rooted in a deep culture of corporate social responsibilityand community partnership. Throughout the academic year, we encourage our students and staff to participate in activities that raise awareness and funds for nominated charities. Our usual fundraising activities have been put on hold because of the lockdown but the College’s commitment to achieving its CSR objectives remains as strong as ever. “We designated May  as a COVID- Volunteer Day to support staff members wanting to help their local community, as well as recognising and celebrating the many outstanding volunteering efforts already taking place.“Adapting to online learning and home working as the new normal has been challenging and we realise that anyone looking after vulnerable relatives and neighbours or home schooling their children won’t have much spare time but we wanted to support staff who want to do something to help but perhaps haven’t had an opportunity to do so yet.”She continued: “As we are all in this together, we felt designating a specic Volunteer Day was a way to give everyone working in the College an opportunity to spend some of their time that day helping those who are most vulnerable. We have a strong and mutually supportive relationship with communities around our campuses so this is our chance to give something back. It’s also our way of saying ‘thank you’ to the amazing frontline workers - many are past or present students of the College - across a wide range of sectors and services.”Many staff are already involved in volunteering and fundraising activities. Kyle Leckey, Health and Safety Co-ordinator, ran . miles, the equivalent of a marathon, around his neighbourhood and raised pound, for FareShareNI, while Social Care lecturer Jacqui McAllister has been working weekends as a healthcare assistant in the COVID ward at Antrim Area Hospital and donating her wages for COVID- research. Child Care lecturers at the Newtownabbey campus have been knitting, crocheting and painting to raise funds for the Friends of the Cancer Centre, as well as producing handmade mask attachments for frontline workers in hospitals. Cheryl McNeil, Business Engagement Officer who also runs Debut Dance Company as a social enterprise, has developed a series of seated and armchair based exercise videos for distribution to residential care homes. The College plans to maintain its volunteering efforts and it’s COVID- Volunteer Response Group, under the leadership of Irvine Abraham, will continue to generate ideas about the best way to supporting support local communities impacted by the pandemic.A wide iety of volunteering activities are planned for Thursday, May  including volunteering at local foodbanks, doing shopping and chores for elderly neighbours, donating blood, producing items of PPE, baking and cooking for vulnerable neighbours and supporting telephone helplines. While many staff will be working in teams to complete the virtual walking challenge between campuses, some are opting for more strenuous physical challenges, and a brave hearted few, at the risk of wearing out the stair carpets, are even planning to scale the equivalent of Mount Everest indoors.

Louise Murray , from Carrickfergus, was due to marry her American fiance Jason Charewicz , from Boston, in her Co Antrim hometown on Saturday, May .But not only has the wedding been cancelled due to coronavirus, it has now emerged that her husband-to-be may be forced to leave Northern Ireland when his visa expires.Ms Murray, whose new job has been put on hold because of Covid-, said the situation was beyond stressful for the couple, who are currently living with Louise#s parents.Jason#s visa won#t be renewed unless we get married, but we can#t get married because of coronavirus... a classic Catch  situation, she told the Belfast .We worked so hard and saved up all our money to be together and now this has happened and everything is up in the air.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseLouise Murray from Carrickfergus and her fiancé Jason Charewicz from Massachusetts FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappLouise Murray from Carrickfergus and her fiancé Jason Charewicz from MassachusettsBride-to-be Louise said that the ceremony on her big day was due to take place in the Catholic church at the bottom of my street in Carrickfergus.Our wedding has been planned for well over a year but it can#t go ahead, she said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseLouise Murray from Carrickfergus and her fiancé Jason Charewicz from MassachusettsFreddie Parkinson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappLouise Murray from Carrickfergus and her fiancé Jason Charewicz from MassachusettsThe priest was happy to proceed with a service just for us and my parents because we live in the same household it would have been a legal marriage for us to tick that box but he was prevented from doing that by the blanket ban on all gatherings.She added: All that we#ve worked for might be down the drain. We might not even be able to stay together in the same country, let alone get married.The young couple, who have been together for over two years, met while teaching English in South Korea.Jason revealed that he is here in Northern Ireland on a fiance visa which requires him to get legally married before August .If the marriage does not take place, he cannot extend his stay or switch to a spousal visa and remain in the UK, meaning that their whole future will be thrown into question.Furthermore, Louise has had no income since February, as the new job she was supposed to start as a support worker in Northern Ireland cannot train her due to Covid-.Although she is still technically employed, her employer cannot pay her, as she cannot start work.Louise, an only child to support worker dad Hughand nurse Lorraine , who are both retired, said she is not entitled to Jobseeker#s Allowance or to Universal Credit.The pair said they have emailed the Home Office but, after almost three weeks, there has been no reply. They also said they cannot get through to officials by phone either.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseLouise Murray from Carrickfergus and her fiancé Jason Charewicz from Massachusetts FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappLouise Murray from Carrickfergus and her fiancé Jason Charewicz from MassachusettsJason told the Belfastthat the two of them were now in despair over their future.The longer our marriage is delayed the more likely it is that we won#t meet the financial requirement of the spousal visaone month of no income becomes three through no fault of our own, he said. If the pandemic hadn#t happened, we would be getting married in May, and Louise#s income over the previous year would exceed the financial requirement that the Home Office stipulates.Louise cannot, however, make income due to the pandemic, and now it looks like this will bring us below the threshold, despite the fact that Louise made well over the required threshold in the past two years.The Home Office requires the partner of the foreign visa applicant to prove their previous year#s income using the past  months.But whatthree of those  months# earning potential were lost by an unforeseen virus The decision to relocate from the Far East to Northern Ireland was the result of Louise#s preference to come home.I didn#t want to live in America, she explained.That meant Jason was prepared to leave his parents Michaeland Deborahand younger brother Brettbehind in the US to make a new le with his Northern Irish love.Jason said they believe that couples in their situation should be allowed to use the  months before the coronavirus pandemic in order to prove the sponsor#s income.He also pointed out that it has already cost them at least £, to get this far in the legalisation process.When my visa comes to expire, and we have had no chance to get legally married due to the pandemic, will the Home Office require that we spend thousands of pounds again on a new application, despite the fact that this one was made null and void by a pandemic  he said.Will they send me back to the States without my partner, where I haven#t lived for years Jason also hit out at the lack of advice from the UK Government on the issue. What does the government suggest we do  he said.They won#t release any advice about this specic situation.It#s inconvenient that British couples must delay their marriage, but for couples where one partner#s status rests on a legal marriage taking place, the lockdown is devastating.He added: We just want answers.Louise said: Not knowing is almost worse than having a bad answer because at least then you could make plans.In response the Home Office said it has put in place a range of measures to support those affected by the Covid- outbreak.  We continue to monitor the situation closely and take these exceptional circumstances into account, a spokesman said.Under current family Immigration Rules, a fiance or proposed civil partner can apply to extend their stay for a further six months where there is good reason why their ceremony could not take place during the currency of their visa.”Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We#ve been told what we have to do.Stopping air travel is not going to stop the spread of the virus - the virus is already here, he said.The logical conclusion of doing so would be that we all lock ourselves up and never come out again.As well as an second flight between Belfast and Heathrow, Aer Lingus has advised all customers due to travel on the route to give themselves additional time to check in, as changes to the boarding procedure will be introduced and more luggage will be checked into the hold.It is expected that this additional frequency will result in reduced loads on each flight, the airline said.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappActors Paddy Jenkins and Damon Quinn join family and friends to raise a toast outside Roselawn Cemetery in Belfast as the hearse arrives during the funeral of actor BJ Hogg. By Ivan LittleMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe cast of the hit TV comedy Give My Head Peace yesterday raised a socially-distanced glass and gave a fond farewell round of applause to the actor BJ Hogg, who created one of the show#s most popular characters and who died last week.Observing coronavirus restrictions at his funeral, BJ#s friends and colleagues stayed well apart as they sipped their own small measures of Black Bush whiskey, the actor#s favourite tipple.The Hole in the Wall gang had been joined at a Lisburn funeral home by some other well-known actors and technicians who had worked with BJ throughout his illustrious career on stage and on screen.The star of The Fall TV series and the Oscar-nominated short movie Dance Lexie Dance died suddenly last week on his th birthday.His costume designer we Elish and their children Nathan and Abigail watched as his coffin was brought from the funeral parlour to a waiting hearse.Nathan had posted a video online of his father singing a powerful song from the Ulster Scots musical On Eagle#s Wing, and he added a message saying: Love you Dad. What a Voice.There were lighter moments on social media too. Some fans of BJ#s alter ego from Give My Head Peace , Big Mervyn, the dim-witted loyalist, wonderedhe would get a paramilitary-style funeral anda service would be conducted by the show#s fundamentalist Protestant cleric, Pastor Begbie.In the end there was no funeral service but Paddy Jenkins, the actor who plays Pastor Begbie, was among the mourners at the funeral home, along with other GMHP performers including Tim McGarry, Michael McDowell, Damon Quinn, Dan Gordon, Alexandra Ford and Marty Reid, who plays Big Mervyn#s sidekick, Uncle Andy.BBC floor manager Stephen Killen was also there, as were Game of Thrones star Ian McElhinney and his playwright we Marie Jones and actors Alan McKee and Marty Maguire.En route to Roselawn Crematorium, the hearse stopped briefly outside BJ#s old boyhood home in Westbourne Terrace, Lisburn.Some of the GMPH team went on to stand at the gates of Roselawn as BJ#s hearse arrived for cremation.No one is currently allowed inside the church there due to the Covid- crisis.Paddy Jenkins, who also worked with BJ on On Eagle#s Wing, reflected on a dficult day.He said: It was heartbreaking to realise that BJ#s loved ones didn#t get the chance to say a proper farewell. But the times we are living in mean nothing is the way it is supposed to be.There mightn#t have been a normal funeral for BJ today, but I know the family and all of us are determined that he will eventually get the sort of thanksgiving service that he so richly deserves once the current coronavirus emergency eases.

Adele Heaney has been working in the Covid- centre at the Mater Hospital in Belfast after being redeployed from the Royal Victoria Hospital to combat the outbreak. The Dungiven native recently featured in a BBC documentary called ‘First Time Doctors’ that revealed the realities of le as a recent graduate on a busy hospital ward. “The purpose of the show was to get an insight to what it’s like being a doctor for the first time and the trials and tribulations of le inside and outside of work,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “So many people just see the doctor and that side of things, so the show was quite nice as it showed a bit of le outside work. “Everyone has had that experience of being the ‘newbie’ in the job and having to learn how to do things in a fast-moving environment. “It was daunting having cameras following you around but the thing that we wanted to show was what it is like for us as doctors.” Coming the end of her second year as a doctor, Adele has found herself thrust onto the frontline of the worst pandemic since the  Spanish Flu which killed an estimated  million people. googletag.cmd.push Adele has pleaded with the public not to become complacent and praised the vocal support that has come from the #ClapForCarers campaign on Thursday nights. “The first week they did that I was very emotional, to be honest,” said Adele. “When you’re in the hospital and you’re doing a dficult job, having tough conversations and seeing people pass away, it’s nice to see people appreciate the sacrices you are making. “The public have been trying to do their best to go by what the guidelines have been telling us – social distancing and staying indoors. We have to keep going with what we’ve been told. “Everybody in the community has their part to play. Your part might just be staying in the house but that is so, so important to flatten the curve and for us to beat this together. “We’ve seen the news reports from Wuhan and Italy, and we’ve seen how devastating the disease can be, so it’s important that we protect ourselves to protect other people.” While tackling the pandemic represents a ‘steep learning curve’ Adele points out that all healthcare staff are coming from a similar position. She said: “Lots of my senior colleagues who have been in the profession for over  years have never experienced anything like this. “I don’t think there is anything in training that really can prepare you. We’ve had to adapt quite quickly to a new style of working. “Coming into work and wearing a mask all the time has been dficult, but we have some amazing senior colleagues who we’ve been able to learn from. “It’s been dficult whenever we’ve had to make phone calls to families about their relatives who are really unwell, you’re not able to have those face-to-face reactions like you normally would. “Learning on the job has been hard, but it’s very humbling to be part of that and to be there for their family members when they aren’t able to be.” Born and bred at the foot of Benbradagh, Adele has already set her sights on a speedywhen the coronavirus threat finally eases. “To be honest, the thing I’m looking forward to the most is being able to come back home to Dungiven and be able to see my family and my boyfriend again,” she said. “It is very dficult when you’re doing this when you are so far from home. We have this persona of doctor but when we come home from work, we like the same things as everyone . “People have made sacrices of moving out of their family homes and not seeing their children or husbands or wives, so people are looking forward to being reunited with their families. “That contact with people is probably the thing I’m looking forward to most, as I’m sure most people are.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At the weekend, the Irish government outlined its roadmap for reopening society and business. The British government is set to publish its plans this Sunday. Speaking at today’s COVID- press conference First Minister Arlene Foster said the NI Executive is working ‘actively’ on its plan and continues to make progress. She said people would be ‘anxious’ to know of NI’s plan but cautioned that social distancing measures are ‘likely to be with us for some time’. The First Minister explained: “In fashioning a plan ministers are being guided by the latest medical and scientic evidence. googletag.cmd.push “We are looking closely at the current rate of infection, the estimated level of transmission, and estimates of future trajectory in this pandemic once relaxation takes place. “Another signicant factor in our planning is assessing the impact on our health and social care system to deal with COVID- cases. “And also of course the resumption of other health services. The Executive is also assessing the wider health, societal and economic implications of the current restrictions to determine which areas will pose the least risk and greatest benefitwe were to relax them. “None of these decisions are easy, as we’ve said before all governments are grappling with the implications of a public health crisis that we never thought would come to pass. googletag.cmd.push “And COVID- has dramatically altered society and will have implications for the way we live for many years to come.” She added that there is a danger of the public becoming distracted and going back to what they did before. The First Minister said the country needs to be on guard and respect social distancing guidelines. She went on to say that people ‘cannot afford to be lax’ and act like coronavirus has been beaten as it still ‘poses a threat to you and those you love’. Restrictions won’t be kept in place any longer than is necessary, she concluded. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said any approach must be ‘cautious and gradual’ as COVID- is still spreading and taking lives. She asked the public not to take matters into their own hands. The plan will be published as soon as possible, ‘hopefully later this week’. Any plan is ‘not a green light’ for people to do as they choose as the Executive is looking at the safest possible approach, the Deputy First Minister added. She also took the opportunity to welcome Finance Minister Conor Murphys announcement of over pound million of new funding for infrastructure, regeneration, and tourism projects across the north. That includes match funding of poundm forDerry City and Strabanes City Deal Inclusive Future Fund.

And he did it all in a good cause, one close to home. The Coronavirus and concerns over social distancing has stopped the sporting calendar, including the popular Belfast event. With thousands of marathon and relay runners racing around the streets, many of them would have been raising much needed funds for a lot of charities. Everyone understands the need to stop the spread of the infection and why the marathon had to be postponed, but Jim felt it would be a shame to let all his hard training go to waste. googletag.cmd.push Jim turns  in June and runs for Springwell RC and cycles for Carn Wheelers. He has been running for three or four years and has completed the Dublin marathon twice and Belfast once. He has signed up for a third go at Dublin this year and is hoping it goes ahead. He decided to run a social distancing compliant marathon on Sunday, the day of the planned Belfast marathon. Jim put his efforts to good use by raising funds for the Intensive Care Unit at the Causeway Hospital in Coleraine, where his we, Nicola has been on the front line as the National Health Service deal with the coronavirus pandemic. googletag.cmd.push The NHS, and all our essential workers, are the ones who have really gone the extra miles in the current emergency and our nurses have had to try and help patients and their families cope with the communication dficulties posed by hospitals suspending all visiting for families as they isolate patients who are Covid- positive. To try and help patients cope with isolation and stay in contact personally with their loved ones, the ICU in the Causeway Hospital is providing tablets for the patients to communicate with their family and Jim’s efforts on Sunday were in support of this worthy cause. Complying with all social distancing regulations Jim set out on his solo mission on a very sunny morning and completed the required . miles of the Jim Bradley Garvagh Marathon in a respectable ...  There is a touching video on social media, filmed by Betty Anne OKane, of him breaking the tape on his way into Garvagh. Jim and Nicola would like to thank everyone who has supported their fund raising efforts with their cheers and applause, with their messages of support and through their donations. “I could not have completed it without the support of the Garvagh running group from Springwell,” Jim added.  The initial fundraising target was pound, but by the time of publishing, the figure had risen to pound,. Also at the weekend, the family business – EJB Cars Garvagh – were giving away a car in a draw to one lucky winner from  NHS staff members Coleraine ICU and Altnagelvin Covid Ward . It follows on from their business April venture of making their courtesy cars available to front line health care workers. Owner Eamon Bradley told the County Derry Post he wanted to help make things a bit easier for NHS staff. “With the work the NHS workers are doing for us, I just thoughtI can make it a wee bit easier in some way, that would help. “I wanted people to reach out and someone to avail of it. The cars are sitting there, they’re taxed and there are two or three courtesy cars there and I thought I might as well offer them out. “Those men and women are going onto what is classed as the front line, to save maybe a relation of mine or anybody. “I always said that nurses and doctors never got enough appreciation for what they do. I know a lot of NHS staff who are working that hard and coming home to families too. It’s a crazy time.” Jim has setup a link for donations and you can contribute via: www.justgiving crowdfunding jimdbradley RELATED - Cars offered to healthcare workers. Click here...

Chair of Derry Trades Union Council Niall McCarroll has taken the opportunity to express his views on the coronavirus pandemic, current political system, the legacy of deprivation in Derry and to launch a workers’ charter. If the last few weeks have shown anything, it is that workers need unions. The low pay and bad conditions of many who are now praised as heroes cannot be tolerated any longer. We will have to be organised to push forward for real change. On May Day - International Workers’ Day - we raised the Red Flag of workers’ unity and socialism and launched our Workers’ Charter. We take this initiative in solidarity with the ordinary people of Ireland in a quest for a world where every child has a decent chance and workers are equal citizens, not powerless to shape their own destinies. googletag.cmd.push The charter calls for the Living Wage for all and a sht in the balance of wealth and power away from corporations and the rich and towards the rest of us. TheCovid- crisisis a threat to humanity. It has also laid bare the huge inequalities which have been covered up by a political system which gives an illusion of fair play and equal rights but deprives huge numbers of working people of rights and basic needs. Now, faced with the possibility of their whole system grinding to a halt, the establishment has found vast sums of money for emergency funding and relief schemes. The money was there all along - even when they were crying poverty and saying they couldn’t afford a boost to benefits or tiny wage rises. googletag.cmd.push Nurses, health service and frontlineworkersare going beyond all reasonable expectation to keep our families safe and the number of deaths down. Yet these are people whohave been undervalued for decades by consecutive governments and employers. Our health service, our care homes, our domiciliary care workers have been treated as it they were expendable, when they are actually crucial. The most precious of our public services have been vandalised by cuts while our unions, the only practical means of defending ourselves and fighting back, have been systematically weakened and marginalised. The community response to the crisis has been brilliant.Care, solidarity and cooperation have been the hallmarks of public response. This contrasts with the actions ofgovernments and corporationswhich have put protecting the “economy” and profits ahead of protecting people and public health. We want all workersto receive a tax-free payment of pound,, plus four additional bank holidays per year. That would be an acknowledgement of all that workers have been put through. Fine words from Government are no longer enough. Globally, one percent of the population holds almost half the world’swealth. We need a new system. But this will onlycome about through working class people across national boundaries beginning to shout out as one. The COVID- pandemic has begun an awakening. People are analysing and questioning the lives they live and the world they live in. Traders, hedge fund and private equity managers carry on regardless, hiding behind their buddies in government while being portrayed in much of the media as the only people who can pull us through the present predicament, get the economy moving again and so forth. If they are not on board, we are told, no recovery will be possible. Our political system has done nothing to challenge this devious assumption. There are few politicalparties which genuinely represent the interests of working-class people. Politics has taken power away from the people moved towards the major corporations. This is a reality all over the world, our world. This takeover of control by a ruling class comes with a decline in real wages and a raft of laws to hamstring union organisation. We need a determined fight back. Under the old way of doing things, PPE was not seen as really important. But the same establishment had no problem when it came to stockpiling private wealth or extracting profit from wealth created by the labour of working people. The NHS, social housing, education, mental health services, community-based social care have been deprived of funds and support while obscene amounts of money are spent on missiles, bombs, drones and all the high-tech machinery of war, which benefits no one apart from arms manufacturers and war-mongers. The UK has the sixth biggest defence budget in the world. It is set to reach pound billion this year. A fraction of this, pound. billion, could more than cover the cost of a year’s furloughing of workers.  The total spend on UK military bases is pound million a year - enough to double the supply of medical ventilator machines. Military budgets and the arms trade are causing untold misery. A government of the people would invest this money in areas such as green energy, creating jobs which would encourage global solidarity and protection of the planet. In Derry and the North West, the crisis has unied people - but has also put a spotlight on the local legacy of deprivation, poverty wages and a run-down of public services. We also have the unreasonable situation of two erging public health responses toCovid- on a small island, increasing the threat to lives. Our lives cross the border every day. But we have erging health services, erging employment laws and erging welfare systems. We cannot allow working people and communities to bear the burden of Covid-on top of a public health and economic crisis. We need a new direction for society, towards equality and justice.

Sport Psychologist Dr Noel Brick is currently involved with Slaughtneil hurlers and has worked with Derry senior footballers. Michael McMullan asked him how athletes should approach lock-down. Its been  days since Leo Varadkar stood on the steps of Washingtons Blair House and insisted that all outdoor mass gatherings of more than  people be cancelled. Our world, has we knew it, has changed. Within hours of the announcement, sporting bodies put their wheels in motion to cancel games and clubs closed their gates to collective training. googletag.cmd.push While Brick, a Kerry man living in Ballycastle, accepts most athletes are driven by the desire to compete and beat others, they often have a dference psyche. He is a lecturer in Sport and Exercise Psychology at the Coleraine campus of Ulster University, has studied to PhD level at University of Limerick and holds a Masters from Staffordshire University. Brick has a background in long-distance running and has managed his own fitness testing business. He is well-placed to assess the needs of the sporting world, albeit in very surreal circumstances. “A lot of athletes are self-driven in the goals that they set for themselves,” he said. “A lot of those goals are not just about competition, they are about improving themselves by getting fitter, getting stronger or improving their skills.” googletag.cmd.push The important thing now, Brick feels, is to reset any goals. Special consideration should be made to aspects an athlete can measure. “Even though competition is very important, through the normal training cycle, there is that competition with themselves and it is about getting better. It is those type of goals that become really important now. These are things that are under your own control and you can reference yourself.” WHAT NEXT  So much of sport planning is about tapering down and peaking at the business end of competition. Coaches often have plans broken down into weeks and even days. Thats all up in the air, but any work done will be worth it, as Brick explains. “Itwill pass and we will come to a time when we do get back to competition. Normal might be dferent for a while, but eventually we will get back. It is recognising that too. Whatever training athletes are doing right now, it will become beneficial.” “Through a normal season you dont always have the time to improve on the things you might get better at. Now, you can reframe it as an opportunity to work on something to get better at and when we do get backyou are a better player.” Inidual work would be aerobic fitness, increasing strength and acceleration, as well as working on technical skills. Its about getting your weak side up to a level you can use under pressure and speeding up the execution of skills. It could be something as simple as rehabbing an injury. What that target is, is irrelevant, but Bricks message is consistent. “It is that competition with yourself and looking at your own improvement. It is something you can control and work on and measure. “There are so many things about this situation at the minute, and this is le in general, that we dont have control over. We dont know when it will end. “We have control over the small things, like washing our hands, but we have no control over when sport happens again and le gets back to normal. “It is about the things you can control right now...working on things like your touch, on your acceleration – you have complete control over these things.” “It is hugely important as we manage our emotions, as we go through this. If you are focussing on things you cant control...you are going to feel anxious, down and all those negative things.” CONNECTIONS Aside from the competitive streak, the sporting environment is one of inclusion. Dressing room banter and the slagging around training breeds a team spirit. After a stressful day at work, exercise and collective training is a welcome release. Without the regular bond, it presents a mental strain. “For our own mental health, it is so important to stay connected to people we normally connect with,” Brick stresses. It is important for team environments to still foster that togetherness, evenit is an articial way, via video conferencing. “You are apart from each other, you are doing a bit of training together but separately. That connection is massively important. “We all take part in sport because we love taking part, but we also enjoy the company of the people we take part with. Keeping that companionship and connectivity is so important. “We are physically distancing and socially isolating, but through that, it is important that we dont completely socially disconnect from other people. It only has benefits and one is for our own mental health.” To conclude, Brick highlighted an non-sport theme he has noticed with many of his students and clients. “People are taking the time to slow down to a certain extent, to reconnect with what is important in le and spend time with family. “That is a positive. We get wrapped up in our work bubble or our sport bubble, we forget about the important things.” RELATED - Derry GAA doctor on the importance of exercise. Click here...

Most of the club football I have watched over the past decade has been senior league matches my own club Ballinascreen have been involved in or the club championship, when I try to attend all the games as I love watching them. So apologies to some of the great players out there who have been outstanding at intermediate and junior level, I’ve kept it to the senior club  here. Michael Conlan Dedication and a serious quest for goalkeeping excellence were his traits, a key part of the three in a row Ballinderry side in -. The final of , in particular, Mickey C’s width and accuracy in his kick outs to his teams ‘four in midfield’ tactic was key to their victory that day. Fine shot stopper too, made his body big, gave the forward less to shoot at. Edges out Antoacutein McMullan and Thomas Mallon. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran Mullan Selected not so much for his defensive skills, as his attacking runs from the full back line for Eoghan Rua, playing a key part in their two county titles of  and . Loved to win ball out in front of his opponent and destroyed many a forward’s resolve by racing forward repeatedly, often up the right hand side of the pitch. Loved the wide open space at Owenbeg, in particular, where his pace was there for all to see. Brendan Rogers With serious pace and raw talent, Brendan transforms the way we think about modern full backs. His forays up the pitch often veered over to the sidelines and racing - yards up the pitch and nobody could catch him. Instrumental in Slaughtneils four in a row and his importance to the team was illustrated last year when he was hampered by injury. Incredible dual player. googletag.cmd.push Karl McKaigue Best man marker in the county, his one on one stats are astonishing against star opponents. Can play a bit too, but tends to keep it simple and save his energies for his defensive duties. Keeps it clean too, quiet, no-nonsense, great reader, interceptions, timing of the tackle superb these are his main traits. Ciaran McFaulBetter known for playing at midfield for Glen, or even in the forward line, but he is as complete a player as there is in Derry club football at present. Great ball carrier, his pinpoint passes often put it on a plate for his full forwards. Great long range scorer as well, but it’s his ‘lead by example’ attitude with Glen that impresses me. Chrissy McKaigue Undoubtedly the driving force behind Slaughtneil’s phenomenal run to four county and three Ulster titles. Fierce will to win, excellent athlete, a ball carrier, dictates the play, his tour de force against Diarmuid Connolly and St Vincents in the  All-Ireland semi final was as good an inidual display as I have seen, racing forward to score four outstanding long range points. Sean Leo McGoldrick Another great ball carrier, an orchestrator, extremely comfortable and elusive on the ball, plays almost like a quarter back at times for his club. Part of the famous McGoldrick clan that have played a huge part in putting Eoghan Rua on the footballing map with an incredible two county titles in  and . Enda Muldoon Big Enda had it all, great fielder, outstanding passer, long range points of either foot, excellent free taker. Played well over two decades with Ballinderry winning eight county titles and, of course two Ulster’s and an All-Ireland club. Always did the business when it counted most as well. One of the all time greats of Derry football, and modest with it. Privileged to have been a team mate for several years. Patsy Bradley The most spectacular sight in Derry football was Patsy taking off and ‘leppin’ above and across several opponents, attempting a miraculous catch. You never knew where, or even how, he was going to land, but more often than not, he either emerged with the ball or got a big fist to it. A fierce competitor, and tremendous athlete, he was the Slaughtneil folk hero that got the crowd roaring and inspired his team every match without fail. Danny Heavron Danny has been a shining example for his club right throughout this decade. Has played effectively in defence as a sweeper, at midfield, or anywhere in the forward line. A great athlete, a playmaker, a great score taker from play and frees, Danny came back from several career threatening injuries to lead Magherafelt to a memorable county title win in . Mark Lynch Extremely powerful runner with the ball, two great feet, fine fielder, accurate free taker often putting up a big scoring total. Could play equally effectively at midfield, number  or full forward. Another player who has combined an outstanding county career whilst giving his all for his club, Banagher. I chose Mark just ahead of Christopher Bradley who was majestic at number  in Slaughtneil’s run to their first Ulster Club title in . Conleith Gilligan Along with Enda, he was the outstanding club player in the county for at least  years from  until his seventh county medal in . Extremely hard to dispossess , evasive, some absolutely outstanding scores of either foot. Brushed off a lot of crap from opponents and just got on with the football. Infectious character who was an outstanding servant for Ballinderry. Paddy Bradley Paddy was still a seriously good forward for Glenullin in the first six or so years of the past decade. His first touch was outstanding. Raced out to the ball, sometimes double marked, controlled it first go either with a catch or palm down to himself, then literally fired it over, straight as an arrow, with unerring accuracy, often from - yards out. Derry’s best ever forward in my letime. If it was a team of the last four years alone, young Shane McGuigan of Slaughtneil would undoubtedly have been chosen, a class act. Colm McGoldrickDeceptively languid style, but Colm has been a consistently top club player for Eoghan Rua right throughout the past decade since their vivacious first county title in . Always finds space against even the tightest opponent, the target man, wins serious ball down the channel, good in the air and has scored umpteen goals for his team over the years. A real pity he was never tempted to give the county team a proper rattle as I believe he would have been a huge asset. Just ahead of Emmett McGuckin. Benny Heron Outstanding player for Ballinascreen over the past decade, a fantastic ’turn on a sixpence’ style has destroyed many an opponent. Great finisher, goals and points, he has rattled up some serious tallies. If I was managing Benny I’d have him up top close to goal every time, where he is a deadly assassin. However, a sublime playmaker further out the field as well, with great stamina.Eoghan Brown, another great club forward, was also considered here. RELATED - Michael McMullans selection.

Her death on Saturday morning at Altnagelvin Hospital has left a profound sense of sadness among her friends and neighbours in the street, which she called her home for so many years. As her remains were brought to Long Tower church on Sunday evening, neighbours stopped to remember a special lady, known for her warm generosity and heart of gold. It was a journey that Bridget Carroll had made thousands of times before, to a church that became her second home. googletag.cmd.push Affectionately known as ‘Wee Bridget’ to all her family and friends, Bridget was a daily Communicant until chronic illness took hold several years ago. At every Benediction service, Holy Hour, Parish Retreat, and Stations of the Cross, Bridget could be found in her familiar seat at the back of the church. Indeed she was a particular devotee of the yearly parish retreat and loved getting the traditional new outfit for the last day. Born in Kilkenny on July , , Bridget came to live at Nazareth House in Fahan as an infant, and received her education at Nazareth House in Bishop Street. googletag.cmd.push Her first job was working in the Nazareth House care home where she loved caring for the elderly residents and listening to their stories. Bridget moved to Dublin to work in the Mater Hospital with her best friend Kathleen, and stayed in the Fair City for  years. However Bridget missed the sense of home she felt in her adopted Derry, and ed to the city where she settled into le working at a number of cafes in the town, becoming a familiar face to many. For many years she lived in the iconic Rossville Flats in the Bogside, and she was delighted when she was relocated to her new home in Bishop Street when the flats were marked for demolition. Bridget’s many friendships formed the centre of her le, always staying in touch with her childhood friend Kathleen Smith who is now living in Dublin, Rita McDaid, Monica Gransha, and Kathleen Doherty from Sunbeam Terrace. You knew she had come for a visit when you heard the doorbell ring, the door open, and her familiar voice shout out – ‘It’s only me!’ The  year old loved to have a chat and always kept up with the local news buying every local newspaper each week. Bridget was a member of many groups often giving her time as a volunteer in Termonbacca, with Cursillo, St Joseph’s Young Priests Society, as a regular chapel cleaner and a parish reader. Bridget also loved travelling and was the first to sign up for any bus runs in the parish. Her favourite run without question was to the pilgrimage site of Knock, but her trips also took her as far as Lourdes on six occasions, Fatima, Buncrana, and Lough Derg. She spoke often of her devotion to the Blessed Mother and Padre Pio, it was this faith that helped her in recent years as she battled her deteriorating health. Several years ago she moved from her flat at the bottom of Bishop Street, to Alexander House at the top of Bishop Street. Here, Bridget found a new sense to the meaning of home. She formed new friendships with the staff and fellow residents, and received dedicated and loving care around the clock. Bridget Carroll will be remembered for her straight talking, unforgettable laugh, loyal friendship and beautul spirit. She often said that even though she was not born here, she felt that she was a Derry woman at heart. Many will miss chatting to her and giving her a wave as she made her way to and from the city centre for her shopping. Bishop Street will never be the same again without her.

As we all know, we must only leave our homeswe are key workers or cannot work from home, to do essential shopping and for one period of daily exercise. By doing this we will all help protect the NHS and save lives. Despite the absolutely necessary restrictions on our normal lives, people are being encouraged to help neighbours in need where possible. This has led to some amazing acts of kindness on every street, in every village and town across the country. googletag.cmd.push Communities have never felt stronger. Today, we shine a light on just some of the people from communities across the country to showcase examples of ordinary people doing extraordinarily kind and helpful things. CASE STUDY GAIL REDMOND  GAIL REDMOND: ‘Dromore area hit hard by redundancies’ Charity that supports families has noticed a sharp rise in requests for help due to widespread redundancies. Gail Redmond of Via Wings’ in the County Down town of Dromore, in Northern Ireland, says the charity normally gives out  food bags a month to people in need. “But last week we gave out  already, many of which are going to people who are self-isolating,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “One guy who contacted me on Friday, said: I have never asked anyone for help like this before. But I have lost my job and can’t afford to feed my kids right now.’ You could tell that he was absolutely mortied and so humble. So many people have lost their jobs. “We have told pensioners not to answer their door when we deliver, but one old lady insisted. We told her she shouldn’t be doing that, but she replied: I just want to say thank you’. “The older generation are so apologetic when asking for help, they all say: I’m sorry to bother you’.” Christian charity Via Wings is offering food deliveries and befriending to anyone who is self-isolating, elderly, vulnerable, an NHS employee, key workers, or those financially impacted by Covid-. Volunteers observe social distancing guidelines and food is carefully wiped down before being packed. Food and toiletry donations can be made at Eurospar, Supervalu and Vivo in Dromore and Tescosand Lidl in Banbridge. Via Wings works with local schools and churches, social workers, care workers and other agencies. “Working in unity is what our grandparents used to do, and that is what we need to get back to doing, caring for each other,” Gail added. “There is no ownership, we are just working together.” CASE STUDY NEIL MUSGROVE  MARATHON MAN: Neil Musgrove putting his best foot forward for an ultra marathon in his back garden in Leeds PIC- NEIL MUSGROVE SUBMITTED BY LEEDS CARES An ultra-marathon runner is putting his best foot forward after several running events planned for this year had to be cancelled or postponed. Last year Neil Musgrove ran seven ultra-marathons and with none looking likely for this year he is running one in his back garden. He is doing a mile a day in his back garden according to his running watch and is hoping to reach his goal of the  mile starting distance for an ultra-marathon by the end of April. For every mile completed, Neil is donating pound to Leeds Cares and hopes that friends and family will join in with the challenge at their own homes and donate after every mile completed. He said: “With no ultra-marathons to run I thought I’ll run one of my own. Any experience I’ve had with Leeds Hospitals in the past has been positive, I want to support all of our amazing NHS staff who are currently under huge pressure and working in extremely tough circumstances. “It is quite a few laps. All being well this takes me to a  mile ultra marathon distance. Yes, it might get a little tedious but I am thinking of it as an ultra with a checkpoint, food and drink at every mile. “My young niece and nephew have already got involved and I’m hoping to get my own kids involved too. I’m sharing the challenge with my colleagues and running club team-mates so hopefully, lots of us will get involved. Make it as interesting as you like. I am thinking about obstacles, singing, dancing, whatever. I would love itpeople joined in. The only rules are it has to be a minimum of one mile. It has to be fully within your own property boundary. If you don’t have a garden, special dispensation is given to use your street but remember the two-metre rule.” All funds raised through Neil’s challenge will go towards Leeds Cares’ Support Your NHS Hospitals Appeal and provide vital support to frontline staff at Leeds Teaching Hospitals. This includes paying for care packages, assistance with travel and accommodation where needed, as well as helping to fund other health and wellbeing initiatives to boost morale across the wards. He set a target of pound on his JustGiving page and has raised more than pound already. Leeds Cares is the official charity partner of Leeds Teaching Hospitals. The organisation supports NHS staff to deliver the best care for patients and their families, by raising funds for equipment, services, education and research. Leeds Cares works collaboratively with all of the hospitals across Leedsto identy charitable projects and causes. CASE STUDY STENHOUSEMUIR FC  ABOVE: ON THE BALL: Stenhousemuir FC players and coaching staff BELOW: HOME ADVANTAGE: Stenhousemuir players brought food directly to people’s houses  A football club initiative is supporting hundreds of families by delivering school meals to pupils during the coronavirus lockdown. With the season shut down indefinitely, Stenhousemuir FC set up its community help hotline in mid-March to assist the most vulnerable members of society as the effects of the global pandemic began to take hold. A -strong squad of volunteers was assembled in the first week to carry out everyday tasks like shopping or dog walking for those in isolation or for whom such activities would prove dficult. Since then, the number of volunteers has hit  although extra help remains welcome. Government guidelines mean the volunteers can leave their homes to help a vulnerable person and, with almost every volunteer already assigned to an inidual, more support is likely to be needed in the weeks ahead. The idea has been well received by those who live in the Stenhousemuir and Larbert areas and beyond, so much so organisers opted to branch out and ease the strain on mums and dads by collecting and distributing school lunches purchased by Larbert High School to youngsters stuck at home. Pupils from Larbert High and its cluster primaries are benefitting from the move. On just one day last month, volunteers delivered more than  meals to schoolchildren. Stenny chairman Iain McMenemy, who helped to organise the initiative, said: “We put out a few requests for further volunteers and the response to each has been really encouraging. “We’re doing one-to-one tasks for people like dog walking and shopping and we’re putting in calls to make sure they’re okay. “The advice was clear:you’re going out for your own shopping,you have to go to work,you’re going out for one bit of exercise oryou’re helping a vulnerable person you’re able to go out, particularly because some people have got nobody . “We have even had members of family from farther afield saying they have a relative in the area and they want to give you a call. “We’re still looking for volunteers as we’re only in week three and the smart money is probably on this being extended for three months. We’ve also expanded out to do school meal deliveries for a number of the schools. Carron Bathrooms got in touch and offered two vans so we now have three. On top of that, we’re doing deliveries for Falkirk Foodbank.” Though Stenny officials admitted concerns over the impact COVID- would have on the club itself, their focus has always been on the “health and well-being” of the community. When the community help initiative was first announced, Mr McMenemy wrote in a statement: “With the continuing spread of the coronavirus, Scottish football faces an uncertain future. “It is quite clear that there will be a signicant impact on football operations and finances and Stenhousemuir Football Club will no doubt be affected by this. “However, there are other, more important matters to think about. The coronavirus is a very serious disease that will affect thousands within our communities. “The health and well-being of friends, neighbours and members of our community should be our top priority.” CASE STUDY HARRY RAGLESS  ABOVE: WALKING TALL: Harry Ragless has raised pound, with the help of his father and his walking frame and leg supports BELOW: STAR MAN: Steve in his dramatic outfit  A boy with spina bida and his father are both doing their bit for the community - but in completely dferent ways. Harry Ragless usually spends  per cent of his time in a wheelchair due to his condition, which means his spine did not form properly in the womb and he has neurological damage to his legs and back and cannot feel his feet. But inspired by the efforts of -year-old war veteran Captain Tom Moore, which have seen him raise around poundmillion for the NHS, Harry decided to raise money by walking with his frame and leg supports. The determined six-year-old from Oaksheath Gardens in Durrington, near Worthing, has raised pound, and rising within days of his parents launching a fundraising page for his efforts - smashing his pound target. He said: “I feel really good. I was shocked.” His proud mother Selina Ragless said: “He has shocked us all. Because of his condition he tires easily but the other day he walked from our house to Vancouver Road, which is really far for him. We couldn’t believe it.” As word of his exploits spread, Selina said people were coming out of their homes to applaud Harry, who attends West Park School in Marlborough Road, Goring, when he went out for a walk. She said: “I feel overwhelmed to be honest. We owe the NHS so much they have been there for him since he was born and will be there for him for the rest of his le. If we can give something back, that is all we want.” In fact, Harry’s exploits grabbed the attention of Captain Tom himself - and his picture was featured on the Second World War veteran’s Instagram page. Harry is not the only person in his family who is raising a smile in the community. By day, his dad Steve is a warehouse manager - but during his daily walk, he dons his Stars Wars outfit to bring a bit of fun to the neighbourhood. The -year-old said: “I love it. From my own experience, I remember the first Comic-Con I went to in Birmingham and I saw all these stormtroopers standing outside, and I went into full fanboy mode.” The opportunity for him to get his own suit arose when a friend was selling theirs. He said: “When I finally put it on, I just felt amazing in it. I love seeing the looks and smiles, and people tooting their car horns and waving. It brings a few smiles in these very strange times.” Selina came up with the idea for him to wear it after they were put in lockdown, and during their walks around the estate Steve has posed for ‘socially-distant’ photos with some of the children who have come out to see him. In his spare time, Steve has donned the costume to a iety of events, including birthday parties, weddings and charity events. When the Connaught Cinema has done showings of Star Wars films, Steve has turned up in his gear to raise money for Sussex Association for Spina Bida and Hydrocephalus, a charity which has helped Harry. When askedthere was anything he wanted to say to the people who have donated so far to his campaign, Harry said: “Thank you.” To donate, visit www.justgiving fundraising selina-ragless.

This follows commitments made by ministers over the weekend that the government will meet with the two representativebodies for publicans over course of the coming week.As part of their discussions with the government, the two organisations will be pressing for pubs to reopen at the same time and on the same basis as cafes and restaurants. Recognising the challenge of maintaining social distancing in a hospitality environment, the organisations will also be putting forward radical changes to the normal operations of barsin order to protect public health.These measures include: googletag.cmd.push • Bars will become dispense bars only with no sitting, standing, ordering, payment or drinking at the bar allowed. • Table service will be a requirement with pubs only serving customers seated at tables. • The numbers on the premises would be confined to no more than  per every  square metres. • A maximum of  people would be permitted at any one table. • Customers will be required to use hand sanitiser upon entry. • All customers must remain seated. • Staff will be fully trained in the new procedures. They will also be asked to maintain a safe distance from customers when taking orders and to wash their hands thoroughlyevery  minutes. googletag.cmd.push • The utilisation of outdoor spaces to enhance social distancing. • Procedures implemented to ensure safe use of toilet facilities, which may include limits on the numbers using toilets at any one time. • No live music or DJs. Speaking about the proposed measures, Donall O’Keeffe, Chief Executive of the LVA said, “We fully respect the need to continue to protect the public health. We have repeatedlyproven this commitment, not least in the fact that our sector was the first to close across the country. We also believe thatother venues who serve food and alcohol are allowed toreopen in Phase , then pubs should be granted the same opportunity to trade. We don’t believe it is in any way appropriate that the Government should apply one rule for somehospitality businesses and another rule for others.“We are making a series of radical proposals to how bars should operate for the reopening scenario. Trading will be extremely dficult under these circumstances. There is no doubtthat the pub experience as we know it will have to change dramatically. Many pubs may choose not to reopen as it simply won’t be financially viable under these conditions.However, for those who want to trade, these measures will have the essential impact of protecting the health and wellbeing of staff and customers alike,” Mr. O’Keeffe said.

Mary Rogers was born in  at the tail end of the Spanish Flu’s effects and reaches her latest milestone as the word is reeling from another pandemic. Unable to enter the home due to Covid- restrictions, Mary’s family joined in the celebrations through the window of the care home where she has spent the last two years. Staff were able to ensure social distancing regulations were adhered to as popular singer Wayne Rodgers serenaded Mary, her family and the other guests.  The former Burns factory worker has been looking forward to her birthday for months and was delighted to receive telegrams from the Queen, President Higgins and her grand-nephew in Australia. googletag.cmd.push Mary began working in Burns shirt factory in Draperstown in the early s and travelled the three miles back and forth by bicycle, beginning a lelong interest in sewing and needlework. The camaraderie in the factory resulted in many friendships and she recalls them fondly while telling stories of her childhood and working le. Mary nursed her father and step-mother during their final illnesses and with less support available back then, had to give up working in the factory to become a full-time carer. Once joking she was the only person to have been carried out of a graveyard after breaking her ankle visiting a grave, she has attributed her long le to having never married. googletag.cmd.push  She has a great rapport with her grand nieces and nephews and is constantly involved in their lives and hobbies, sometimes learning the rules of unfamiliar games in order to stay engaged. Mary’s niece, Sue Boyle, thanked the staff at the care home for their support. She said: “Having cared for so many throughout her le, she is now lucky enough to receive the excellent care of the staff in Magherafelt Manor. “We want to put on record their appreciation for all their thoughtfulness and support. “We also want to thank all her friends and neighbours for their help and support to Mary while she was at home and for their best wishes on this great occasion. “Mary’s positive attitude, determination and strong faith have given her the blessing of a long, full and happy le and we hope will see her celebrate many more birthdays.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The response to the classes has been brilliant and I have kept it on, even though I am teaching PE full-time in Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch.ldquoObviously with COVID- I am off work now and with no GAA or fitness classes I have more time on my hands.ldquoI put out the idea on social media on Friday morning and then spent the weekend putting together the first class to upload Monday morning.ldquoI honestly didnrsquot know what to expect really. I was thinking maybeI managed to pull in a hundred people at pound each, pound would be a reasonable target.But I have really been overwhelmed by the response.Members of her usual weekly classes in Pilates for Paula responded immediately, but her school quickly weighed in behind the effort and her many acquaintances in GAA and camogie.Despite her organisation of the fundraiser, in her words being ldquoa bit last minute, her target was realised eight-fold and she presented a cheque for pound, last week.ldquoI couldnrsquot believe it really. When I saw Instagram stories of Sophie Colgan in New York taking part, Eiliacutes Niacute Chaiside [the Slaughtneil camog], who has been in New Zealand for the past year, signing up, and Sarah Donnelly, the Tyrone footballer in Australia, it just shows you that the people you meet through the GAA will always support each other.Paula last year captained Clonduff to the All-Ireland club title and she has played for Down and Ulster over many years, while her husband Darren is the Down football captain.ldquoThe GAA camogie community is absolutely fabulous. They rallied around my family after Christmas and provided a lot of comfort and again the response has been phenomenal.ldquoCOVID- has challenged the family once more. Clodaghrsquos parents, my brother Darren and his we Carol, live in Coleraine and it has been very dficult for us as a family to support them. What has happened over Easter week has given us all a huge lt and we are very thankful for all that support from our GAA family.ldquoI have got a lot of messages since the last class on Friday and everyone seems to have enjoyed them. A lot had never done exercise like that and now want me to provide more classes online and keep it going for as long as we are all prevented from going back to work.ldquoI think plenty of people are finding the lockdown very tough mentally and I got that back in the messages too, about how they felt a lot more positive after doing the exercise, a lot fresher and ready to face the day.She added: ldquoThe people who supported the fundraiser have helped themselves, helped Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI Research and really supported the Gribben family.You can still contribute to Leukaemia Lymphonania Research by searching for Carol and Darren Gribbenrsquos fundraiser in aid of Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI on Facebook or follow this link https:www.facebook donate  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Delamont.jpg","title":"Delamont remains closed in lockdown  ","story":"DELAMONT Country Park outside Killyleagh is to remain closed to visitors.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has confirmed that the gates to the stunning park on the shores of Strangford Lough will not reopen, despite last weekrsquos decision by Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots to reopen Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks.The decision not to allow visitors into Delamont was taken by the leaders of the local councilrsquos main parties during a meeting held via Skype last week and has been welcomed by local councillors Billy Walker and Dermot Curran.Cllr Walker said all the party leaders agreed that is it too soon to reopen Delamont, confirming that the closure decision will be reviewed next month.ldquoThere are real concerns that allowing the public to access the country park could lead to a major surge in visitors which is not what anyone wants at this particular time. The last thing we need is for family picnics and hundreds of other visitors arriving at a time when coronavirus remains a very real and present danger, continued the Rowallane councillor.Cllr Walker described the decision to reopen forest parks as ldquopremature and said Newry, Mourne and Down Council deserved praise for keeping all its country parks closed for the time being.He added: ldquoThe closure decision is being kept under review and I believe that there is still some way to go before council-owned parks will be open to the public.ldquoThere will be people upset that Delamont remains closed, but we all have to adhere to the public advice we have been given in relation to social distancing and, where possible, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Cllr Curran said he supports the decision to keep Delamont closed and praised what he described as the local authorityrsquos ldquocourageous decision.He argued that the big danger with warmer weather and clearer evenings now here is that reopening the country park could lead to a major influx of visitors and that enforcing social distancing measures would be particularly dficult,not impossible.ldquoThere was perhaps a temptation to reopen Delamont given the decision to allow people to access Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks, but the local council has stood firm, putting the safety of people front and centre and is to be applauded for doing so, said Cllr Curran.ldquoErring on the side of caution is the right thing to do at this time. It would be an awful situation to reopen the park and for someone to contract coronavirus as a result. The park will reopen at some stage, but not just now. Peoplersquos health and safety must come first.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman said despite the decision by Mr Poots to reopen parks managed by the Forest Service all those that the local authority is responsible for, including Delamont, will remain closed.Council officials say that the decision to close Delamont taken on March  remains in place for the time being, but will be reviewed as public health advice guidance develops.ldquoMembers decided that it was too soon to consider reopening parks at this time, said a council spokesman.In addition, he said it was felt that reopening local authority-owned country park would encourageresidents from outside the district to make a non-essential journey to these facilities for exercise, thus increasing the volume of traffic and congestion at these locations and increasing the risk of further spread of COVID- across the district.ldquoThe focus of the council at this time must be the safety of our citizens and implementing measures to reduce the spread of the virus, said the spokesman.ldquoThe council continues to advise our citizens that the single most important action they can take is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Doreen.jpg","title":"Doreen to step down after 20 years as leader at Leitrim playgroup  ","story":"A LEITRIM woman, who has been the driving force behind a local playgroup for almost  years, is stepping down.Doreen Shahmohammadi is a familiar face around the village, especially to young people as the leader of Leitrim Community Playgroup.Doreen, her Iranian husband, Reza, and twin sons, Michael and Colm, settled in Leitrim a few years before she began the playgroup in January . She soon experienced a strong sense of community and friendship that has kept them there ever since.She started the playgroup with the support of the local GAA club, Liatroim Fontenoys, which offered her use of their premises to begin with.ldquoIn the first year we went from having five children to  children, she said. ldquoWe had no funding in the first year, but the Fontenoys were very good to us by covering the cost of heating and telephone charges.ldquoBy the second year funding was made available by the Southern Education and Library Board for  pre-school places and it wasnrsquot long before we secured funding to build a purpose-built playgroup which sits within the boundary of the Fontenoys club.ldquoWithin a few years and thanks to additional funding enrolment rose to  places. Depending on the birth rate it has usually remains around the same number each year.Doreen loves to have children around her. In fact, Reza reminds her all the time that she is a magnet in attracting them wherever she goes.Doreen is a very proud mother. Her sons, now , graduated as doctors five years ago and both are working on the frontline during the COVID- pandemic. Colm is working in intensive care, while Michael works between cardiology and intensive care.ldquoOver the years, I have loved, cared for and educated every child that has come to the playgroup as though they were my own children, he says.ldquoI am going to miss them all very much, more than you can ever imagine. I hope Irsquom not to be a stranger to the playgroup after my retirement.Doreen says the current playgroup team, made up of deputy leader Michelle McCabe and temporary assistant, Danielle Clarke, have worked well together over the past few years. Other long term members of staff were Janet King, Tina Owens and Diane Baxter.ldquoThe playgroup has been my le and I have enjoyed welcoming hundreds of children to their pre-school year experience. It is a lovely learning environment to be part of, she continued.ldquoWe are blessed with the children and their families in the community who have entered our setting and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff and committees past and present, children, grandparents, childminders and, of course, the wider community who have supported me and who have been so generous over the years.ldquoMost of all, I would like to thank the trustees who have supported me for all these years and provided me with the opportunity to establish an excellent learning environment for pre-school children, not forgetting my sincere thanks to the Fontenoys for all their support and encouragement.She added: ldquoI wish my successor every success and I hope they will enjoy and appreciate every single minute they spend with the children as I have done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Life.jpg","title":"Ex Drumaness man praises Kiwis as country comes out of lockdown  ","story":"A FORMER Drumaness man who has been living in New Zealand for the past  years has this week revealed what le in lockdown has been like Down Under.Barry Brennanrsquos adopted homeland has been praised for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, with the country this week emerging from a strict five-week quarantine which included the strictest constraints paced on New Zealanders in modern history.The countryrsquos prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, hailed New Zealanders for their incredible work to ldquobreak the virusrsquos chain of transmission which has allowed the country to downgrade its highest alert level from four to three, with amendedrestrictions expected to be in place for around two more weeks.The move means that many shops have reopened while public gatherings of  people are now permissible for weddings and funerals, with schools also set to reopen. In addition, Kiwis can now fish, hunt, surf, swim and play golf.New Zealand has suffered only , confirmed coronavirus cases and  deaths after moving quickly to impose a lockdown last month, with the easing of quarantine measures paving the way for around , people toto work under a more relaxed regime.Barry mdash who specialises in home renovations and employs several people mdash has not ed to work yet, but is more than happy in the idyllic rural setting of Mangawhai in the North Island just five minutes from the beach, where he lives with his we, Sian, and children Sean, Danny and Liam.The New Zealand government is still asking citizens to stay at home and to practise social distancing, with Barry hoping that it wonrsquot be long before the country again enjoys some sense of normality.And he has the praised prime minister for her approach to COVID-, with Arden arguing that a drastic short-term action would benefit the countryrsquos economy in the long run.On Monday, it was confirmed that there is no widespread underlying community transmission in New Zealand, with Ms Arden warning that the country was not yet out of the woods.ldquoWhen you look at what happened where in the world in relation to coronavirus, the prime minister did a good job, said Barry, who headed to New Zealand with his friend Barry Armstrong in .ldquoI was a qualied carpenter and Barry, who lived just up the road from me, was a bricklayer who had a contact in New Zealand so we headed off on a -month visa to Auckland. Barry stayed for  months before heading home but I am still here, married with three boys.ldquoThe coronavirus has had a worldwide impact and while many people were wondering what would happen in New Zealand, I always had a feeling that the prime minister would go at the pandemic hard and fast and that is exactly what she did.Barry revealed that New Zealanders were told to prepare for lockdown on March  and that two days later a series of strict measures were introduced.ldquoClearly the prime minister had a look at what was happening in other parts of the world before the virus got a hold here and she moved to minimise its impact. I think that she has done an amazing job to be quite honest.ldquoFour and a half weeks after the lockdown measures were implemented, there was only one confirmed coronavirus case in New Zealand at the start of this week. Indeed, the government knows exactly where every case is in the country.Barry said anyone arriving in the country and is suspected of having the virus is quarantined and believes thatthere was ever to be another pandemic in the future, countries would do well to take a close look at what New Zealand did to halt its deadly spread.ldquoEverything really happened so fast here and we did not have that much time to think about what was going in, he continued.ldquoI played golf with the principal of the school my youngest boy attends and he said he did not think NewZealand would go into lockdown. Forty eight hours later we were told it was happening.Barry said the country rightly decided that it wasnrsquot taking any chances and locked everything down, apart from supermarkets, with strict social distancing rules in place.ldquoWe have gone from a level four alert to level three but I am still not back at work as there a lot of iables that I need to consider, explained the former Drumaness man. ldquoIn my line of work I would be close to homeowners so I will just wait until the restrictions ease a bit more.Barry relocated from Auckland to Mangawhai six years ago and home is now a three and a half acre plot where he built a shooting gallery and what he describes as a ldquobit of a golf course. He also looks after a few animals.With no immediateto work on the horizon, Barry is keeping busy mowing lawns and feeding his animals, with a little help from his sons.With his parents, Sean and Mary, still living at the family home at the Cumber Road in Drumaness, Barry says he is in regular contact with them. He said his dad is good with Whatsapp and regularly tells him that New Zealand lamb is cheaper in Ireland than down under.ldquoWe have lots of contact with my parents and are in touch once or twice a week. I also have an older brother, Seamus who lives in Auckland. We both played for Loughinisland GAC. I also keep up-to-date with what is going there via social media and stuff, he continued.ldquoMy brother, Mark, is a former Loughinisland club chairman who was involved in the plans for building the new clubhouse. I also keep tabs on Down GAArsquos fortunes.As Barry waits for the right time toto work, he said that during the lockdown, New Zealanders mostly did what they were told.He added: ldquoThey were sensible and the approach has worked as things are slowly ing to normal, but we know that we have a little way to go yet..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 29%2C 1980  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ndash A new library for Newcastle is to be given priority soon by the South Eastern Education Board, it was claimed this week.The claim came from Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, who said she believed that Board members realised they had made a bad mistake and are now prepared to reverse their attitude.Mrs Smyth, addressing a meeting of Down councillors on Monday, explained that she had recently asked the Board for an undertaking that the Newcastle Library project would be given a priority rating for new capital schemes.ldquoI think the whole Board realised they made a bad mistake and they are quite willing to go ahead and get something done quickly, said Mrs Smyth.Mrs Smyth made her surprise announcement after Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue attacked the Boardrsquos attitude over a new library for the seaside town.Mr OrsquoDonoghue claimed that an original Board decision to put Newcastle on a low priority rating was taken without consulting the Boardrsquos chief librarian who was in favour of early attention for Newcastle.He called the lack of consultation and criticised the Board for not responding fully to points raised by a council deputation several months ago.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Ballynahinch Chamber of Commerce is beginning to draw up plans for another trade week ndash and such was the success of the last venture that itrsquos been decided to extend this yearrsquos event to ten days.The dates being set aside for the trade week are Thursday, June th to Saturday, June st, and it is hoped that the townrsquos traders will offer many bargains to help attract business.Last yearrsquos trade week was a major success and most businesses in the town have reaped the benefit since. New customers were attracted to the town and quality goods and competitive prices have encouraged many toon a regular basis.The growing stature of the town as a shopping centre has been helped by the introduction of new shops, particularly in the Dromore Street area, and by the good car parking facilities on offer.Market Day every Thursday brings hundreds of people from the surrounding district flooding into the town ndash and with two Market Days cropping up in the new extended trade week this year, the Chamber is hopeful that shopping will hit a new peak in June.QUOILE ndash A concerted effort is being made by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Down District Council to make the -mile stretch of the Quoile River into a fishing paradise.Regarded as one of the best fishing waters in the province, the Quoile is hardly known nationally, and itrsquos the aim of the Tourist Board and the council to make it as popular as the Fermanagh Lakelands, the current number one fishing haven.The joint effort to put the Quoile on the fishing map is being spearheaded by Ian Heaps, the former inidual world champion angler and current member of the English international team, who has been carrying out a survey over the past ten days.And his report could influence the Tourist Board to pump more money into publicising the Quoile to world-wide anglers.Already Heaps has spent ten days fishing the Quoile and its ancillary waters ndash and his expert opinion is that itrsquos one of the best that Northern Ireland has to offer.KILLYLEAGH ndash The Vikings ed to invade Killyleagh this week ndash but this time it was a more peaceful visit.The invaders, instead of arriving by longship to pillage and plunder, came to look over youth provision in the area and they left totally impressed by the friendly reception they received.The unlikely invaders were a group of youth workers from Norway and Spain, who visited the area as part of a five-day study of youth work and facilities in the province.Local stops were at the Seaboard Sailing Centre in Killyleagh, Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre in Castlewellan and Downpatrick Folk Club.Tuesday afternoon and night was spent in the area, with the first stop for the Norwegians being at the Seaboard centre.STRANGFORD ndash The recently formed Strangford Village Improvement Committee is to seek public support to have an order enforcing the one-way system in the village revoked.The committee discussed the system at their monthly meeting on Thursday and, after hearing of the failure of a meeting between the Department of Environment officials, traffic police and RUC representatives to have something done about it, they decided that the support of the public is needed.The committee chairman told members that the top level meeting had fallen on deaf ears and that nothing could be done about the situation.They had discussed the possibility of altering the system, the ious proposals which the committee had made as alternatives to it, and the fact that the majority of residents did not want the system.Unfortunately the Department rejected all the committeersquos proposals and insisted that the system, in its present form, would have to remain, said the chairman.The chairman had askedthe one-way system would not be made permanent until all attempts to accommodate the residentrsquos wishes had been made but the Department replied that the systemis already permanentand had been made so by Government order.

The online sales are set to continue as marts across the province begin to reopen.Cllr Lewis said the marts have a crucial role to play, allowing farmers to buy and sell livestock, at what is a traditionally a busy time of the year for them. Crucially, he said reopening marts will help with their respective incomes.He said there was ldquosignicant concern when the marts closed last month, with farmers expressing concern that they could find themselves overstocked with animals, particularly store cattle and ped calves.ldquoNews of the gradual reopening of local marts is an important development and will be widely welcomed across the agricultural sector at this time, said Cllr Lewis.The Slieve Croob councillor said DAERA was to be applauded for its decision, particularly given the key role farmers play in supplying the local food chain.ldquoIt is essential that in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public, he continued.ldquoAt this time of year, many farmers are seeking to purchase stock for the grazing season and obviously others are selling their stock through the marts. Dairy farms will also find themselves overstocked with dropped calves that they would normally be selling.Cllr Lewis said there were farmers wishing to sell and buy livestock and it was ldquovital in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public.A DAERA spokesman said farmers were key workers and were continuing to provide food for everyone in ldquovery challenging circumstances with part of the food supply chain the ability to trade and sell animals.ldquoStaff within the department have maintained regular contact with livestock mart operators over recent weeks and have been reassured that robust operational protocols, developed by the marts in conjunction with other stakeholders, will enable them to conduct business in a manner that is safe for staff, farmers and buyers and adheres to social distancing requirements, he continued.ldquoFarmers, like all businesses, are facing financial dficulties as a result of COVID-.

In many ways, itrsquos strange to think that by staying home I can save a le.My sister, Martina, loved le, but she was only  when she passed away in . Seasonal flu was the culprit which overwhelmed her body. COVID- is a frightening virus for the world to contend with. But it is especially frightening for people like me.Martina and I were born with spinal muscular atrophy , a genetic muscle wasting condition which robs people of the ability to walk, eat and breathe.I now live an active, productive le, thanks to many interventions that started in my childhood. I had a tube ed into my stomach to ensure that I could get the nutrients I could no longer eat as half of the muscles I use to swallow became paralysed. I also began using a non-invasive ventilator.COVID- has been on our radar since the beginning of January. I could do little but watch and wait. The plans would not be much dferent than my usual flu-time plans which ensure that I am in protective bubble, which allows my family to do everything it can to maintain an infection-free environment around me.Sure enough, almost  days ago, it was time to take action, with the Hollywood lockdown coming almost two weeks before it was implemented for everyone . And within a few days of the official lockdown beginning, I was also furloughed from work at a leading charity for people with conditions like mine.This has been one of the most emotionally and mentally dficult parts of the pandemic for me personally. Since I was  I have been working with and for this charity to improve lives. But within a few short days my le had drastically changed.Last September, I took eight flights in three weeks as I was selected for an Emerging Leaders programme by the US State Department for my work with disabled people and for a national conference for people with conditions like mine in London.Now, I have to stay within the bounds of my driveway. I can only go outside because my neighbours are all so far away. A small mercy.It quickly became obvious that getting food and other essential supplies was not going to be easy. Large supermarkets only started offering registration to extremely vulnerable customers a few weeks in to the lockdown.Before lockdown began few,any supermarkets offered a dedicated shopping time to extremely vulnerable customers, making getting food dficult during a time when it was flying off the shelves in panic buying.Crossgarrsquos SuperValu store got us through those first few weeks as it was able to deliver some essentials, while Gordons Pharmacy in Downpatrick has been delivering to us for some time now. But the pharmacyrsquos willingness to collect our preions has been a huge weight off our shoulders.I have now been able to register the family with Sainsburyrsquos for deliveries of other items we need to keep us ticking over, while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos food delivery package service has been much more successful than those in other parts of the UK.The one that we have received included food that I could eat ndash something many of my friends in the rest of the UK are not so lucky with. The parcel is one small, yet very important part of the support our government is offering that it has got right, even though it has only been in place for us for three weeks.It took us several weeks to set up everything we needed, but I know that many others are still trying and are having to take drastic, le-endangering measures to keep it going.However, COVID- is not just a negative in the lives of disabled people.Virtual concerts, musicals on YouTube for all and even online quiz nights have become the new normal of socialising.Many jobs and educational institutions have moved staff to work from home and online, something that some disabled people were often refused when they asked for it. Even the community spirit and volunteering has left us feeling overwhelmed with offers of help.It is my hope that we can use this opportunity to see what our future can be.A more accepting and inclusive society, where disabled people can fully take part. Creative thinking mdash both economic and social mdash have taken a cannonball to the social infrastructure that was a climbing wall and turned it into an accessible lt.I want us all to realise how positive this can be for society and act upon it, even when the pandemic is over..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Laura.jpg","title":"Laura takes chair  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN woman Laura Devlin is to become the districtrsquos new first citizen.The Mournes SDLP councillor is set to take over at the helm of Newry, Mourne and Down Council when the local authority holds its annual meeting next month.Cllr Devlin will replace Sinn Feinrsquos Charlie Casey in the council hot seat, while two Ulster Unionist councillors mdash Robert Burgess and Harold McKee mdash are in the running for the councilrsquos deputy position.She was chosen as her partyrsquos nomination for the top council post last week, with the councilrsquos Ulster Unionist members set to confirm shortly their preferred choice for the vice-chairmanrsquos position.Cllr Devlin has been a member of the SDLP since  and is a highly respected politician who was co-opted to replace Eamonn OrsquoNeill on the former Down Council in .With her position as the new council chairman confirmed, all eyes are on the UUP to see which councillor the party will pick to be her deputy.Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis and Slieve Gullionrsquos David Taylor have ruled themselves out of the running for the post due to work commitments, leaving it a straight fight between Cllr Burgess and Cllr McKee, two of the UUPrsquos most experienced councillors.Cllr Burgess is a former Down Council chairman and is also the current chairman of the Ulster Farmersrsquo Unionrsquos Co Down Branch, while Cllr McKee was a former South Down MLA and member of Newry and Mourne Council.The annual meeting is traditionally held in the debating chamber at the local authorityrsquos Downshire Civic Centre in Downpatrick, but alternative venues are currently being examined to comply with social distancing guidelines in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.The council debating chamber is not large enough to ensure that the districtrsquos  councillors, council staff and the media can safely stay two metres apart.The Recorder understands that several options are being explored on the way forward, with a formal announcement expected shortly.Down Leisure Centre, which is currently closed to the public, has been touted as a possible base for the annual meeting, with proceedings taking place in the expansive four court sports hall on the first floor.It is being suggested that the large area would allow councillors, officers and the media to comfortably comply with social distancing legislation.An alternative suggestion which some councillors believe could be a potential runner is an annual meeting attended by just the leaders of the councilrsquos main parties and the leader of the Independent members.Ahead of the AGM, the main parties have already selected which councillors will be appointed to the local authorityrsquos ious statutory committees and who will fill the top two positions on each.And, in keeping with public health advice to maintain social distancing, it is understood that the formal ceremony to present the new chairman with the chain of office will also not take place.

Unfortunately after all of the hard work of labour, I had to have a C-section and James Patrick was born at .pm on Tuesday. Ryan was allowed into the recovery room with me for two hours, but after that he didnrsquot see me or the baby until Thursday afternoon when we were allowed home.Prospective parents have been told that only one birth partner is currently allowed into the delivery ward, but onlythey are well and show no signs of coronavirus.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoApart from the labour and the C-section, it was a positive experience. I think I was more anxious in the days coming up to the birth as I didnrsquot know what the restrictions would mean. In hindsight, it wasnrsquot that bad and it was probably worse for Ryan sitting at home. He rang his sister who has four children and asked when she thought he could do and she said clean the house.Baby James Patrick was only one day overdue, but Mrs Lawlor was delighted that he decided to make an appearance when he did. A clue to his birth weight may be due to his mother being ft  inches tall, while dad Ryanis ft  inches.While Mrs Lawlor did not have to wear a face mask during her labour, but the midwives who attended her afterwards were masked.She said: ldquoI suppose as this was an all-new experience for both Ryan and I we have nothing to compare it to.ldquoI remember waking up the next day, not that I slept that much in the night, and thought, lsquoOh no, I have a whole day by myself in here with this brand new babyrsquo. But the nurses and midwives are coming that often to do a iety of checks that the days went quite fast.ldquoHowever, I remember that I felt the second night in hospital was awfully long and I really struggled with dealing with James. Normally,you have a bit of help during the day and night, you can manage better to get a bit of sleep.ldquoThe strangest thing was seeing quite a few of the staff with masks and visors on. While they were all lovely, you lost a bit of the personal touch and connection with them because of the masks. Sometimesthey were maintaining social distancing and werenrsquot close to you, you couldnrsquot actually see who it was. The staff were all wonderful but you didnrsquot know what they looked like.As a sportswoman, who used to play for Loughinisland GACrsquos senior ladies and at county level, Mrs Lawlor is recovering well after the birth. Her husband is also well-known in local sporting circles as hersquos on the executive committee of Loughinisland GAC.They are becoming accustomed to the lsquonewrsquo normal at home of being first-time parents amid the lockdown.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoWe have had visitors to the house looking through the window at the baby. Itrsquos still hard for everyone as my sister is itching to get a wee cuddle and all our family members want to hold him. That canrsquot happen for very good reasons and I donrsquot know when that will change. Thatrsquos one of the strange things about having a baby in the lockdown.ldquoHowever, the simplicity of le today is quite nice. I think itrsquos possibly the best time to have a baby. We have plenty to keep ourselves busy with James Patrick in the lockdown and therersquos nothing  to distract us. Ryan is a self-employed plumber andit wasnrsquot for the lockdown, he probably would have been ing to work sooner so itrsquos good for us to have this time together..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Not.jpg","title":"Paddy Mo’s greatest Down side of all time  ","story":"p.pp.pspan.s Paddy Doherty was a key member of the historic Down All-Ireland-winning team of . In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Ciara.jpg","title":"Portaferry athlete takes lockdown in her stride  ","story":"CIARA Mageeanrsquos Olympic ambitions may have been put on hold owing to coronavirus, but shersquos taking the lockdown in her stride mdash almost.The  year-old Portaferry runner, who is currently holed up in Manchester, says the current restrictions arenrsquot that far removed from her normal training regime.Even so, she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my team-mates about that and you justhave to find little methods ad mechanisms to try and help yourself.Last Thursday, Ciara was one of a number of leading sportsmen and women at the virtual launch of Sport NIrsquos Wellbeing Hub in response to the COVID- challengeThe hub provides instant access to helpful information, guidance and screening that is tailored specically to help care for wellbeing needs.It offers a range of innovative tools and resources, including guided self-assessment via lsquoChatbotrsquo, self-help programmes and digital intervention tools, a searchable five ways to wellbeingrsquo map and a wellbeing information library.Ciara said: ldquoOur mental health is so vital and right now is a challenging time for all of us.A full-time athlete and a member of Team New Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig.

Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room!

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is comforting to imagine that police excesses during coronavirus have been teething troubles yet it is hard to make excuses for the statements of senior police officers : FreelanceFirst Coronavirus, and then economic woes — now a cull of civil liberties.Instinctively, we sympathise with hardworking police officers at this most dficult time. It is comforting to imagine that police excesses were mere teething troubles The police’s made-up coronavirus law ought to unsettle anyone who understands democracy,’ Sam McBride, April . It was doubtless a new recruit, bored of making tea, who fabricated Facebook edicts for the good folks of Larne. Perhaps Causeway Coast officers were distracted by the fine scenery while ticketing people for buying food. Yet it is dficult to make excuses for the premeditated statements of senior police officers. Issuing clarication, Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said:“Is your journey necessary and is it reasonable  These are the questions you need to ask yourself before you travel because the test of reasonableness and necessity are the parameters within which police officers must operate.”.This is an astonishing statement. While requiring a ‘reasonable excuse’, the legislation nowhere mentions ‘necessity’ as a condition of leaving the house. Never. Not once. The commentary of a Trappist monk on the  Olympics could not be more profoundly silent.When pressed to justy this, the PSNI noted that the legislation referred to activities such as exercise or giving blood as ‘a need’.Our police leadership did not seem to notice that the legislation ‘includes’ such needs as reasonable excuses, so allowing the possibility of others. Equally oblivious that a general ‘need’ is not a particular ‘necessity’, they remained unperturbed that no other UK police force extracted this meaning - despite operating under the same wording.So we were left with the peculiar situation where the Assembly had determined that exercise or obtaining food was a ‘need’, but the PSNI was taking upon itself to question whether any particular form of exercise or food purchase was a ‘necessity’. Aside from democratic implications, this ‘necessity’ test is unattainably high.I have a need of nutrition, but it is hardly a ‘necessity’ that I munch on this particular Granny Smith at this set time. The Assembly says I can take reasonable exercise. “Ah”, counters our officer, ‘but is it necessary to walk down this deserted lane  Whatyou are tempted to take a photograph or allow your child to pick some flowers  You could run on the spot in your kitchen, preferably while self-flagellating for doubting our advice”.On the th April the PSNI, together with the Department of Health, issued a further statement.Happily, all tests of necessity have gone the way of the dodo, and wemay hope they rest in peace.Radically, the police now intend to follow the law, applying a test of‘reasonable excuse’. While a further explanation that reasonable excuse refers not to the intentions of the inidual but government policy is unusual, let us be charitable. Well done.Yet the final sentence of the statement is sobering:“We are deeply concerned that the current discourse may serve to undermine public confidence in the overall regulations, and encourage some people to ignore the strong guidance from the NI Executive with potentially devastating consequences.”.It is unclear that the police should act as cheerleader for the wisdom of any government legislation. Yet regardless of how many laws are made up, or how inaccurate statements seem, senior police are “deeply concerned” at public comment on the issue. Nothing to do with me, Gov’!This apparent indference to free speech in the very body supposed to guard our liberty: that is what deeply concerns me.• Andrew Clarke is a councillor for Coast Road, Mid and East Antrim"},{"url":null,"title":" most popular cat breeds uks favourite felines ragdoll maine coon and siamese ","story":"Another  people have died after testing positive for COVID- in NI bringing death toll to  - find out how many people have passed away in your areaOne year MOT temporary exemption certicates for all eligible vehicles - certicates to be processed automatically from May  onwardNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusFarmingNewsPeopleCats : Other rd Party most popular cat breeds: the UK’s favourite felines - from ragdoll to Maine Coon and SiameseCats are one of the nation’s most loved pets, butyou’ve ever wondered which are the most popular breeds then pet food company Purina has compiled a list of the UK’s favouritesBy Helen JohnsonWednesday, th May , : pm\"\"These are nine of the most popular breeds of cats, in no particular, according to Purina - do you agree  .

They were very annoyed by it, because this doesnt reflect what grassroots Labour members are about and it gives the wrong view of the Labour Party.“Now it’s up to the Labour party leadership to take this by the scruff of the neck and sort this out, and I’ve asked Keir Starmer to do that.”Mr Paisley added: “It is absolutely abhorrent that these sort of narrow-minded views are being propelled. I think it shows the level of misunderstanding and I think the tweet was probably put there out of ignorance or to deliberately provke.“I think the person who did this should be severely disciplined by the Labour Party.If this is done out of ignorance, that says more about the person who tweeted it — they are an ignoramus and they shouldn’t be doing that.”UUP MLA Doug Beattie said: “This is incredibly insensitive to those people who were victims of the IRA.“Young Labour will become the present day Labour — the young activists now will become the politicians of the future — and is this is the view that they have now “If they have so little regard for those people who were victims of the IRA including those victims in London, in Birmingham, in Manchester, men, women and children murdered by the IRA,that’s their understanding of what happened here in Northern Ireland then God help usthey are the politicians of the future in regards to Labour.”Mr Beattie continued: “Labour needs to get to grips with this. Keir Starmer needs to take a stand. He needs to understand exactly what Corbyn has created within that party. “Now, Bobby Sands is dead and I do not wish to speak ill of the dead but this is a case of them promoting the aims of the IRA and that’s an affront to victims.“Their tweet and their views does incredible harm. There’s a naievity about this, there’s a lack of understanding about this, there’s an insensitivity. Keir Starmer needs to get a grip of it now.”A Labour spokesperson said: “The tweet in question is inappropriate. The Labour Party will always be committed to cross-community cooperation and the principles of the Good Friday agreement.“Our role must be to remain as a trusted partner between all communities in Northern Ireland and help all sides work together to not only address the legacy of the troubles but create a prosperous future for all the people of Northern Ireland.“That is Labour’s legacy and one we remain completely committed to.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

This means that owners of all eligible cars, goods vehicles, trailers and motorcycles, will no longer have to book and pay for an MOT appointment in order to get a TEC. TECs will be applied to eligible vehicles for up to one year from the date the vehicle was due to be tested. Any appointments in the system will now be cancelled and refunds issued. Due to the volume of refunds being processed, this is taking longer than usual. Separate arrangements are already in place for taxis and buses, allowing vehicle licences to be renewed without the requirement for prior testing. Speaking as she addressed the Assembly today, Minister Mallon said:  \"I am very conscious that for the past number of months one of the areas of signicant disruption for people has been the provision of MOTs by the DVA, caused initially by faults in the lts and more recently by the need to suspend all vehicle testing services in order to stop the spread of COVID-.  “My officials have been working hard to find a number of solutions for the wide range of vehicles they test and a number of exemptions and extensions are currently in place, some of which are soon due for renewal.  “To avoid any further confusion and until MOT services can be safely resumed, from Monday, DVA will process TECs automatically for all eligible cars, goods vehicles, trailers and motorcycles for up to  months from the date the vehicle was due to be tested.   \"This will ensure that those needing to make essential journeys can stay on the road. These certicates will be added to the DVA system, not issued in hard copy. As is always the case, DVA will contact customers well in advance of the new MOT due date.” Vehicles due an MOT soon will also now have a TEC processed automatically.

This means that owners of all eligible cars, goods vehicles, trailers and motorcycles, will no longer have to book and pay for an MOT appointment in order to get a TEC. TECs will be applied to eligible vehicles for up to one year from the date the vehicle was due to be tested. Any appointments in the system will now be cancelled and refunds issued. Due to the volume of refunds being processed, this is taking longer than usual. Separate arrangements are already in place for taxis and buses, allowing vehicle licences to be renewed without the requirement for prior testing. Speaking as she addressed the Assembly today, Minister Mallon said: I am very conscious that for the past number of months one of the areas of signicant disruption for people has been the provision of MOTs by the DVA, caused initially by faults in the lts and more recently by the need to suspend all vehicle testing services in order to stop the spread of COVID-. “My officials have been working hard to find a number of solutions for the wide range of vehicles they test and a number of exemptions and extensions are currently in place, some of which are soon due for renewal. “To avoid any further confusion and until MOT services can be safely resumed, from Monday, DVA will process TECs automatically for all eligible cars, goods vehicles, trailers and motorcycles for up to months from the date the vehicle was due to be tested. This will ensure that those needing to make essential journeys can stay on the road. These certicates will be added to the DVA system, not issued in hard copy. As is always the case, DVA will contact customers well in advance of the new MOT due date.” Vehicles due an MOT soon will also now have a TEC processed automatically. There is now no longer any need to book and pay for a test in order to get a TEC.  DVA is continuing to process refunds for customers who require them as quickly as possible. Given the volume in the system, it is taking longer than usual at present but DVA is working hard to issue these as soon as possible.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_febddcacdb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dbaaadacbf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
