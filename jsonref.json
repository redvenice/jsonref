In the paintings of east Londoner Frank Laws, however, there isn’t a person in sight. The only signs of life are curtains flapping at open windows and the luminescent glow emanating from inside a home. Blocks of flats that teem with life in, say, Plan B’s film and album Ill Manors, stand eerily quiet and vacant in Laws’s images.Laws was born in a village in Norfolk but hated the rural quiet. “I was always scared of the dark in the countryside,” says the 37-year-old. “I’m still scared of it.” It’s this fear, and Laws’ love of film noir, that informs the dramatic, Edward Hopperesque lighting in Laws’ meticulously detailed watercolour and acrylic paintings.Each of the 4x5-ft works takes more than a month to complete at his studio in Dalston, and is based on photographs Laws takes during walks around the area – framing them from a pedestrian, spectator’s view. Their silent stature is impressive – set centre stage, the buildings are imposing characters that direct the human activity that moves through them.After a year working as a labourer in Norwich, Laws relocated to Lower Clapton in east London in 2008. He was immediately struck by the beauty of the area’s social housing estates – his time as a bricklayer gave him a particular appreciation of the work that had gone into the postwar buildings. “The tiled roofs, the brickwork details around the doors and balconies, I was obsessed with them – it was visual overload.”Some of the buildings that became his muses over the next decade included Valette House – an impressive five-storey Edwardian block, one of the first to be built by the London County Council in Hackney, with sash windows and red and red-grey brickwork. The postwar buildings of Mayville Estate and Pembury Estate, as well as the historic Parkside Estate in south Hackney, have featured in his work. Laws used to title his paintings after the buildings that inspired them, but he is now leaving them untitled to encourage viewers to rediscover these local architectural landmarks.In his paintings, Laws maintains a spectator’s view as an outsider looking in. Researching the buildings at Hackney Archives, though, has deepened his appreciation of their inidual history and “what they meant or supposedly meant politically – as better homes for families, affordable housing, where communities could thrive. A lot of positivity came out of those places, but that isn’t always thought about or reported.” Now, he says, the estates are “reminders of what has happened with housing since they were built”.Such ruthless commercialisation, his says, is “very much the climate we live in. But it’s easy to forget what has remained. This is my attempt to really romanticise and elevate these buildings and their original purpose.” Laws’s new exhibition, Monuments, will be presented within another overlooked gem of of east London’s neglected architectural history Holy Trinity Morgan Street, a 19th-century, Grade II-listed church that closed during the second world war, but recently reopened as an arts centre.The east London estates he’s painted this time aren’t always considered historic. “They’re just everyday homes that we pass all the time,” says Law. “I’m trying to show them in a certain light, as future relics.” Yet there’s no didactic moral to these beautiful pictures. “My paintings ideally would be a vessel for discussion and awareness – not an answer or full stop.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cdb310865e7b624ae64170a1a33a240edf19845/69_0_2867_1721/master/2867.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78fdfbccf342ea7c762812739371f5ef","title":"jeff bridges best photograph george clooney men who stare at goats","story":"‘This is George Clooney on the set of The Men Who Stare at Goats. I’m playing with the idea of comedy and tragedy – the masks of ancient Greek theatre’As an actor, and coming from a family in entertainment, I’ve spent pretty much my whole life on set. But what a lot of people don’t realise is just how much downtime you have between scenes. Photographing those moments became a way of documenting my life and the lives of people around me, like a personal archive.Ten years ago, I had just finished filming Crazy Heart when I got a call from George Clooney pitching me his new film, The Men Who Stare at Goats. I was exhausted, but it was such a crazy idea I was immediately interested. When I started to explore it in a little more depth, I knew I had to do it, and off we went into this crazy thing together.I had never met George before, but he was splendid to work with and for. He produced the film and starred in it, and we had such a great time making it. He created such a relaxed atmosphere on set. As this picture shows, he’s playful – an entertainer who’s game for pretty much anything.I shoot on a Widelux, a mechanical swing-lens panoramic camera, which is how I got this doubling effect. I get George in the far left of the viewfinder, then as the shot is exposing, I shout “shift!” at which point he turns his face and makes his sad face. The actor doesn’t move across or anything, they just turn their head.This image is part of a series of photographs that plays with the idea of comedy and tragedy and the masks of ancient Greek theatre. Partly, it’s a way of me exploring what is to be an actor, and tapping into the thrill of acting as I see it: the chance to represent what it means to be a human being – the extreme joy and sadness that make us human. But it also speaks to the masks we all wear in different situations.I’ve always been interested in photography. As a kid I played with my dad’s Nikon, and when he installed a darkroom in our house I loved getting into the technical side of it and seeing what shots would come out of the soup. The first wide-lens camera I had was a wedding gift from my wife, and I’ve shot pretty exclusively on Widelux cameras ever since.I started shooting on set during the filming of King Kong in the 1970s. My character had a Nikon strapped around his neck, so I thought I might as well use it. I guess it started out as part of my character but it became this passion.I used to get mad at myself for taking photos, or playing music, or writing songs, or pouring myself into any creative pursuit that wasn’t acting. I would berate myself that it was a waste of time, that I should focus on one thing. But I’ve come to realise that creativity feeds creativity – it’s all part of the same thing and that you should give yourself time to explore your passions.Shooting on set is a pretty amazing thing. First, because the lighting is spectacular. And second, you’re shooting people who know how to interact with a camera. For me and a lot of actors, even being around a camera changes something in your chemistry.I never intended to publish these shots. Originally, I did it so I could make little books for the cast and crew to remember the experience and time we spent together. Usually, at the first script reading or the producers’ meeting, I’ll ask if people are OK with me shooting backstage. They tend to be pretty cool with it.But it felt as if I should share the work with the world. It’s a way of giving something back to the motion picture industry that has been such a wonderful home to me for decades.• Jeff Bridges: Pictures Volume 2 is published by powerHouse Books on 15 October.High point: “The joy of developing an image that completely exceeds your expectations.”Low point: “Getting your photos and finding that they’re disappointing or not quite right, somehow.”Top tip: “Keep your fingers out of the shot!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b82c444cab7c0a12c4ca549f7f0668289dd00b88/0_464_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d90cf5d9cde5e29e4ff407f76e261de","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.To begin, let’s go to the end of Anthony Trollope’s The Prime Minister, the final book in the Palliser series, as reviewed by capedoctor:With a central theme of 19th century British political life and intrigue, the resonance with current political chaos is astonishing. Although there is no resemblance whatsoever between the eponymous prime minister and Mr Johnson, the smooth journey of landed gentry into political office, the transience and superficiality of political alliances and the jealous protection of self-interest and patronage seems not to have changed much in 150 years. Added to this are Trollope’s eloquence as a writer, his power of understatement on crucial social and political issues and so many other reasons why I personally keep going back to the great Victorian novels.Two views on The Dutch House by Ann Patchett. LLCoolJ writes:In a nutshell: it’s not her best, but it was still supremely satisfying to read, and I find myself still thinking it about it a week after finishing, which doesn’t always happen with any author.But even a less-than-perfect Patchett is better than lots of stuff, and I’m very glad I read it.And Cardellina has also been enjoying it:I haven’t read a Patchett novel before (although “Bel Canto” has lingered on my informal “to read” list for a while), and I bought it purely on the strength of its ludicrously gorgeous cover (always a risky move - I’ve been burned before). So far it has been the perfect book for being curled up under a blanket with a gross cold.Country by Michael Hughes has impressed fingerlakeswanderer:A retelling of the Iliad but set in 1996 Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Achill is a sniper with the IRA who chooses to sit out his cohort’s raid on a local army base. He’s furious because he has been personally betrayed over a relationship, and he refuses all entreaties to change his mind, especially those from his friend, Pat. Henry is a British soldier who first fought in the Falklands, and now he’s been sent to Northern Ireland. Everything leads to the consequences of Pat’s refusal to fight.“I’m currently reading and enjoying (if that’s the word) Julian Barnes’s The Only Story,” says scarletnoir:Barnes is on top form here, telling a tale where the protagonist is roughly the same age as himself, and starting when the young man (19) falls in love with Susan (48). Every word is chosen with care, and the writing is top class.“I am re-reading Alan Booth’s Looking For The Lost in advance of a hiking trip to Japan starting next week,” says greenmill:Although I won’t see the Japan that Booth travelled through or have the level of engagement with local people in remote rural areas that he did (he was a fluent Japanese speaker whereas I have got to the heady heights of evening college level 2), Booth’s beautiful prose which is alternately elegiac and comedic, remains an inspiration for my coming travels. His early death robbed us of a gifted travel writer whose love for his subject is burned into every page.Finally, rgilyead has found plenty to recommend The Testaments by Margaret Atwood:Atwood’s ideas about Gilead have obviously been maturing for many years, helped, as she acknowledges, by feedback from readers and the opportunity to work on the TV adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale. This book is so rich in subtle details. I felt that the TV series, by making her horrific vision visible, actually diminished the impact of the story. She has an incredible, almost offhand, way of suggesting the horrors that have taken place. This book explores how Gilead came to exist and the insidious way in which precious freedoms were lost. The testaments of the three principal characters interleave to build up the picture of the rise of the theocracy and the bravery of the women who fought it. I think the book is a stunning achievement. Margaret for the Nobel, I say!Sounds like a plan. (The Nobel winners will be announced on Thursday.)If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

A reasonable percentage have actually cried.”Irene Hays, who chairs the business, said some new recruits “gave us a cuddle even though we didn’t know them from Adam” after a presentation welcoming them to the company.The couple insisted they could make a success of the business where Thomas Cook’s previous management had failed.Irene Hays rubbished a claim by the Ryanair chief executive, Michael O’Leary, that the number of people booking flights and hotels online meant the package holiday industry was “screwed”.“No, we do not agree with Michael O’Leary,” she said. “There’s been a huge resurgence in package holidays in recent years.”According to statistics from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the number of package holidays taken in the UK has been rising steadily since 2014, reaching 18.2m last year.The Hays said they had no immediate plans to shut any of the 555 stores, although John Hays acknowledged some closures might become unavoidable in areas where there was an overlap.Hays has 190 shops and will almost quadruple in size following the takeover, which was agreed with the receiver, the government official overseeing Thomas Cook’s liquidation.John Hays opened the first branch of his travel company at the back of his mother’s childrenswear shop in Seaham, County Durham, in 1980, recording sales of £812 in the first year.Since then the business has expanded across the UK, employing about 1,900 staff with a turnover of more than £1bn last year. To mark the £1bn milestone the company shared a £1m pot with its employees, who each received £100 for every year they had worked at the company.Despite the vast expansion plan, Irene Hays said her husband, 70, had no plans to hand over to a successor and was “not going anywhere soon”.“I’m tired because we’ve put in a fair shift since Thomas Cook went down,” said John Hays. “I found the sofas at head office are quite comfortable for sleeping on. But we’re still passionately engaged and we’ve got a strong senior management team.”The pair said they were locked into lease agreements with Thomas Cook’s landlords for nine months but could seek to renegotiate rents in future to cut costs.However, they insisted that a network of bricks-and-mortar high street shops could still be profitable in an internet-dominated world.They pointed to the fact that, unlike Thomas Cook, Hays is free of debt even after the cash-funded acquisition, and operates from lower-cost headquarters in Sunderland.John Hays also said the company’s business model was better suited to the internet age, with web enquiries leading to customer visits on the high street.Thomas Cook’s spectacular failure last month, after the government refused to provide a bailout, stranded 150,000 holidaymakers overseas, landed the government with a repatriation bill expected to exceed £100m, and put 9,000 jobs at risk.The trade union Unite said the deal with Hays showed that “various parts of the business were viable”, calling into question the lack of financial support from the government.“It is clear that the government’s assessment that providing any financial assistance would risk ‘throwing good money after bad’ has been proven to be entirely false,” said the assistant general secretary, Diana Holland.The union urged ministers to call a halt to the insolvency process of Thomas Cook’s “profit-making” airline.Labour’s shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, called for a “full public inquiry into the government’s handling of this scandal”. The business minister, Andrea Leadsom, who has been criticised for a lack of involvement  to try to save Thomas Cook, welcomed the sale to Hays, saying it would provide “significant re-employment opportunities”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d3c1b5cb3dc498ff25a5a1177f4f3fa7bd0c620/0_92_4668_2801/master/4668.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f04f5511fc3428a297c1d4238c4dede","title":"tom kerridge fish and chips cheltenham literature festival","story":"Kerridge tells Cheltenham literature festival his dish uses ‘incredibly expensive’ potatoesIt might sound pricey, but £32.50 is reasonable for fish, chips and curry sauce if it is turbot caught that day and the finest quality potatoes inidually hand-cut, the chef Tom Kerridge has insisted.Kerridge’s restaurant dish is much more expensive than what people might expect to pay at their local chippy.But he told Cheltenham literature festival there was no comparison. “This was fresh dayboat turbot,” he said, adding that if a diner had pan-roasted turbot with pomme puree and a sauce gribiche for £32.50, “no-one would question anything”.His chips were inidually hand-cut from “incredibly expensive” potatoes, he said. “If you break it down, it is easily justifiable,” Kerridge said.“From my point of view, fish and chips is one of the greatest dishes in the world. There are Japanese three-Michelin star restaurants that are doing tempura, that are specialising in amazing pieces of fish that are deep fried and served and cost the earth.“Why can’t we get the best fish in the world and create the best batter, deep fry it and serve it with amazing potatoes?”His dish comes with a fruity Matson sauce, named in honour of the curry sauce he remembers having as a child from his local chippy, now closed, on the Matson estate in Gloucester.Front-of-house staff often tell diners it is named after a Gloucester estate. They don’t imagine the type of estate he means, he said: one “with swings that haven’t got the swing bit over it”.Kerridge added: “Oprah Winfrey was in a few weeks ago and she had Matson sauce. I love the fact Oprah Winfrey has had fish and chips with Matson sauce. She knows Matson.”Kerridge has done a lot in his books and on television to demystify cooking. He told the festival it was good to have a microwave in any home kitchen and fine to use stock cubes.He also gave the audience a potentially life-changing tip: roast your mince.Most people making a bolognese sauce will chop and fry onions and garlic, add some dried herbs and “throw in a packet of mince, stir it around until it goes a bit grey and all that water comes out of it”.Instead, he said, put the mince on a roasting tray for an hour in the oven, stirring occasionally. “Texturally, it is amazing. It goes really dry and crunchy and you put it in the stock and tomatoes it rehydrates but it still has this lovely texture. The flavour is massive,” Kerridge told the festival."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d35c82b384dadeb57d4951bc4cb5c30f4b6f238/0_232_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13935656be2bf5590f79cf6f6bf63fad","title":"british airways offset domestic flight emissions from next year","story":"Announcement comes as parent company commits to net-zero carbon flying by 2050 British Airways will offset all domestic flight emissions from next year, after its owner IAG became the first airline group to commit to net-zero carbon flying by 2050.IAG’s chief executive, Willie Walsh, said that the company would reach the net-zero target largely through offsetting but pledged its airlines, including Aer Lingus and Iberia, would also substantially reduce emissions through sustainable fuels and replacing older aircraft.Walsh said offsetting was the only way aviation could promise to carbon net zero and that electric or hydrogen planes would not be an option for most international flights. Offsetting allows companies to invest in environmental projects to balance out their own carbon footprints but it has been criticised as a get-out clause for highly polluting businesses.Walsh said: “We will continue to use a carbon-based fuel throughout. We don’t see a credible alternative. It’s going to be some time until we see an electric or hybrid-electric plane … you’re looking at smaller aircraft capable of flying up to 150 passengers up to 1,000km. The technology to cover the entire network is some time away.”However, he argued that aviation offsetting would invest in regulated, verified carbon-reduction schemes, whereas levies on flying would disappear into general taxation. He said: “In the past there have been concerns about the schemes. It’s very clear that any offsetting scheme has to be a permanent reduction in CO2, and verifiable.”Walsh agreed flying could become “socially unacceptable” if it did not cut emissions. “For some people it will be, in the same way that a car is. But a lot of activity that is normal and socially acceptable today will not be in future.”But, he added: “When I took my first flight in 1979 it was a privilege. The idea that you go back to where only a privileged few can experience flying is, I think, socially unacceptable.”Walsh said BA was offsetting domestic flight emissions as people could choose to travel by train: “In the UK where there is an alternative, there is a greater focus on making sure aviation is paying its way to address the environmental impact.”Walsh said BA would not fly its remaining 33 Boeing 747 jumbos, the heaviest consumers of fuel in the fleet, after 2024. Walsh said the new Airbus A350-1000, which has just entered service on the transatlantic route to Toronto, would typically use 43 instead of 70 tonnes of jet fuel to carry a similar number of passengers.Questioned if it should do more, he said: “We are the first to do it, so if it’s not enough, the world has to do more. We’re aligning ourselves with the government. It’s a huge change from what the industry committed to, so it’s a challenging target, a lot of work and a lot of money.”The cost of offsetting UK flights, which generate about 400,000 tonnes of CO2, is expected to be about €3.2m (£3bn) next year. BA has pledged to invest £327m in sustainable fuel over the next 20 years, including its recently approved joint venture to build a waste-to-jet fuel plant in the UK.Environmental groups, however, dismissed the IAG initiative. Greenpeace said BA wanted to “have their cake and eat it”. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “Offsetting is no answer to the climate emergency that we face, where we have to stop business as usual. BA really need to think much more seriously than this.“What we need is a frequent flyer levy, which would be a better way to go in terms of reducing demand.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc02279040c7a17f14f92c9926eb822d93f33a82/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=384df75a92bd206a5e25ac40c360d647","title":"workers exploited at farms supplying uk supermarkets report","story":"Oxfam finds poor pay, 13-hour shifts and high disease risk at farms in India and BrazilPoor pay and punitive working conditions are common on farms and plantations that supply fresh fruit or tea to major UK supermarkets including Lidl, Aldi, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Morrisons, according to new research published by a leading international charity.The report from Oxfam claims that the supermarkets’ “relentless” drive to maximise profits is fuelling poverty and gender discrimination in their retail supply chains. Its research is based on in-depth interviews with workers in India and Brazil and a separate survey in five other countries.Interviews with workers on 50 tea plantations in Assam allege that cholera and typhoid are rife because of poor access to toilets and safe drinking water. Half of those questioned receive government ration cards because they earn so little while female workers regularly clocked up 13 hours of hard labour a day.Aldi, Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsbury’s confirmed they source their own-brand tea from companies whose suppliers include the estates visited and Lidl was amongst other global supermarkets who source their own brand tea from the Assam region.On fruit farms in north-east Brazil, women with children said they were forced to rely on relatives or government support to feed their families outside the harvest season. Workers reported allergies and serious skin diseases as a result of using chemicals without adequate protection on grape, melon and mango farms that supply supermarkets including Lidl, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and, previously, Morrisons.Rachel Wilshaw, Oxfam’s ethical trade manager, said: “Despite some pockets of good practice, supermarkets’ relentless pursuit of profits continues to fuel poverty and human rights abuses in their supply chains. Supermarkets must do more to end exploitation, pay all their workers a living wage, ensure women get a fair deal and be more transparent about where they source their products.”Oxfam also found that supermarkets are taking the lion’s share of the price paid by shoppers. Of the 79p paid by shoppers for a pack of 100g black Assam tea in the UK, supermarkets and tea brands receive 49p while workers receive just 3p.The research was produced as part of Oxfam’s global Behind the Barcodes campaign, which aims to improve the lives of the millions of people around the world producing food for supermarkets who are trapped in poverty.A separate survey of more than 500 workers on farms in the Philippines, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Peru and the US found that three-quarters of workers said that they were not paid enough to cover basic needs such as food and housing.On behalf of UK supermarkets, Peter Andrews, the head of sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: “Supermarkets in the UK are spearheading actions aimed at improving the lives of the millions of people across the globe who contribute to the retail supply chain. Our members are working hard to address existing injustices and continue to collaborate with NGOs, business groups and government on this vital issue.”A spokesperson for Tesco said: “This is the second year that Tesco has been assessed by Oxfam as doing most, of all major supermarkets globally, to ensure human rights are respected in food supply chains. But we know there is more to do and we are working with NGOs, trade unions and others to improve wages in the key produce, tea and clothing sectors.”An Aldi spokesperson said: “We continue to work hard to ensure every person working in our supply chain is treated fairly and has their human rights respected. We share the values behind Oxfam’s campaign and are in regular dialogue with them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b34f965ce5df67ba96214089e66f0f9be8434e36/52_8_1391_834/master/1391.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e64054e125af8ab665759dc901c1d02","title":"a serious urban mistake why paris went sour on the new gare du nord","story":"As developers aim to turn France’s busiest train station into a gargantuan airport-style mall, Parisians fear for the local neighbourhood – and the station’s soul“When you tell people in Paris you live near the Gare du Nord, they usually grimace,” sighed Sarah, a French academic in her 50s who has lived on a narrow, traffic-choked street next to Europe’s busiest station for 30 years.“Architecturally, the station building is superb. But neighbourhoods around stations are never easy, wherever they are in the world.”Sarah is part of a local residents’ group that has found itself drawn into one of Paris’s biggest development battles in years. The state rail firm SNCF has joined with private developers and is poised to transform the Gare du Nord into a gargantuan €600m (£540m) shopping and office complex along the lines of an airport. The French government says the massive glass refit – which will chop up the station into walkways and mezzanine levels via 105 escalators – is the only way to cope with the staggering 900,000 passengers per day who will be using the rail hub by 2030.But top French architects and urban planners, including the award-winning Jean Nouvel, are leading a rebellion. In an open letter they slammed the plans as “unacceptable”, “indecent” and a “serious urban mistake”. Paris city hall, which is merely an observer of the project run by the state, has this month vociferously opposed the private commercial plans to add vast shopping space, pleading for it to scaled back. A planning commission verdict on Thursday will determine whether the plans can go ahead. Meanwhile, Paris is grappling with what the essence of station is and how residents should live around it.“They can argue all they like about what is going to be put inside the station, but if the area around the station isn’t taken into account and altered, with the thundering road traffic eased, the neighbourhood will never improve,” Sarah said.The Gare du Nord is one of the busiest rail hubs in the world, behind only the biggest Japanese stations. When travellers get off the Eurostar from London or the Thalys from Brussels and Amsterdam they are – unusually for an international terminal – stepping right into a frenzy of local, commuter and northern transport which sees the departure of 2,100 trains a day, with 500,000 daily travellers from the Paris banlieue (suburbs) alone.And yet the Gare du Nord occupies a comparatively small site wedged into one of the most built-up and densely populated areas of one of the most tightly-packed capitals in Europe. It sits in what was historically a working-class area with a large hospital right beside it, roads hemming it in and almost no green space in the surrounding streets. With trains already running for four storeys below ground, and traffic choking the chaotic and unusually small forecourt, there is precious little room to expand.For a decade, the 19th-century building, seen as an architectural and engineering masterpiece, has suffered from unflattering comparisons with the calm and gleaming St Pancras in London where Eurostar passengers alight in the UK. Andy Street, the former head of John Lewis who is mayor of the West Midlands, even had to apologise to France in 2014 after calling the Gare du Nord “the squalor pit of Europe” compared with what he called the “modern, forward-looking” St Pancras. But the Gare du Nord’s 700,000 passengers per day dwarfs the footfall of the airier London Eurostar terminal. St Pancras has discreetly tucked its shops beneath lower level arches, while the Gare du Nord has obstructed its main concourse with retail units plonked here and there – at the expense of seating for waiting travellers, who as a consequence are often reduced to sitting on the floor.The French state railway SNCF wants a gleaming new station for the 2024 Paris Olympics, even though many architects believe this deadline is too tight. But the giant scale of the project has led to soul-searching about the city’s future.Paris politicians on the left say private money has been allowed to dictate the project and threatens the very fabric of the station. France’s indebted state railway company now renovates Paris stations in partnership with commercial property giants, who stump up the cash and claw back profits by putting in large numbers of shops. The €600m plans for the Gare du Nord – drawn up with the supermarket giant Auchun – would turn the Gare du Nord into a gargantuan shopping and office complex along the lines of an airport. There will be separate spaces for arrivals and departures, which will push travellers up and down a striking number of walkways and escalators to get to and from the tracks while passing the maximum amount of shopping opportunity. Like an airport, there has even been discussion of putting up signs warning people how long it will take to reach their platform.Paris city hall – which is not in charge of the project – has for a year pushed for changes from the sidelines, saying there wasn’t enough space for bikes, not enough thought about rail-users and too much commercial focus, that the project was ridiculously big just to enable a private firm to make money. But suddenly this month, Paris city hall under Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo, toughened its stance, arguing the “needless” shopping complex should be scrapped and instead the state should fund a much smaller and simple refit. The government and the state railway insists the full project must go ahead if France’s image is to be upheld for the Olympics.Politicians on the left have warned that the French business model of building vast flagship shopping centres is in decline. Several giant shopping complexes are currently struggling, including one in Aubervilliers on the northern edge of Paris and another near Charles de Gaulle airport. Plans to build a giant shopping and leisure complex north east of Paris called EuropaCity have sparked a huge political row, with business unions warning it will kill small shops in nearby towns. Just one stop away by the RER train from the Gare du Nord, the Forum des Halles at Châtelet is already home to a gargantuan shopping centre which was recently recently rebranded as a Westfield. Restaurants and bars dominate the streets around the Gare du Nord, doing a good trade, and many fear that the new station plans will hurt the neighbourhood economy.The row is so fraught because the Gare du Nord has always had a symbolic place in the social make-up of Paris and the region that surrounds it. It is the gateway to the banlieue and the packed local trains bring professionals to Paris as well as a large proportion of the city’s low-income workers doing crucial service jobs.“I just want to get straight to work and straight home at night and have a seat on the train,” said Maria 52, who lives on an estate north east of Paris and takes crowded trains to several different cleaning jobs each week.In 2001, during the last major renovations, a much-praised glass shed brought some light down into the dingy levels below ground. The architect, Jean-Marie Duthilleul, said: “Instead of looking at their feet, now people can raise their eyes.” But the station is still under pressure to rid itself of the sense it is some kind of border between the rich bustle of Paris and a young population discriminated against and pushed to the outskirts. In 2007, hundreds of youths fought running battles with riot police throwing tear gas inside the station after a man was stopped for fare evasion. The station now has the biggest police presence of any transport hub in France.Alexandra Cordebard, the Socialist mayor of the 10th arrondissement, which is home to the Gare du Nord, lives in an apartment between the Gare du Nord and the nearby, smaller, Gare de L’Est. “Historically, this was the heart of working class Paris, with factory workers and tradespeople with the only remaining large working factory in Paris, the Clairefontaine paper factory,” she said.She said the compact 10th arrondissement, with 100,000 people living in less than three square km of densely packed streets with no public parks, sees its population swell to 1 million people each day as passengers arrive at the two main stations. The patchwork of local apartments and small studios has a broad cultural mix, including students and artists as well as richer residents who have made money on larger properties.Three years ago, France’s first supervised injection facility for drug users opened on a street adjoining the Gare du Nord to allow addicts to inject with clean syringes and under supervision in order to curb overdose deaths and transmission of diseases spread by needle-sharing. Cordebard stressed its opening hours are soon to be extended. The station area has also become a focal point for homelessness. Residents groups insist there must be a post office in the new station as many local services near the station, including the old post office, have closed. Massive traffic jams in front of the station, with motorbikes parked up across pavements, mean it is often a challenge to even cross the road.Cordebard’s key concern is how the area will remain liveable with the climate crisis and rising temperatures. The station and the nearby hospital emit heat amid vast road traffic pollution, and virtually no green space to counter it.“If you look at the thermal map of Paris, the area around the Gare du Nord is the hottest part of the whole city,” she said. “It’s one of the hardest parts of Paris to cool down – we have to limit motorised vehicles and we have to find ways to plant trees.”She added: “For the Gare du Nord to suddenly have this huge extra shopping centre built on top, bringing dozens and dozens of extra lorries a day, bringing extra rubbish each day in a place which can already barely absorb its own daily traffic and activity, I think that’s a problem. It adds to the carbon count, energy consumption and rubbish when we’re already saturated here. Shouldn’t public powers contribute more and build something smaller and better?”In his office at city hall, Paris’s head of urban planning, Jean-Louis Missika said: “A station is about creating a sense of airiness and emptiness, allowing passengers to calmly connect to this monumental public space, it is not about stuffing it full of obstacles for them.” He wanted a return to “the feeling that stations were the big industrial cathedrals of the 19th century” – with the addition, above all, of more space for bikes and connections to public transport.At the Eurostar terminal, Florent, 24, a politics student on his way to visit his sister in London, looked out over bustle. “There’s too much privatisation of public space everywhere else already, stations should be for the passengers,” he said. “But I prefer St Pancras, it seems to have more of a link to history.”And yet the Gare du Nord is dripping in history. The 1864 building, with its striking facade by the German-born architect Jacques-Ignace Hittorff, was built to expand on a smaller earlier station, and was described in the 1920s by the influential architectural historian Henry-Russell Hitchcock one of the great masterpieces of 19th century architecture.It was built at a time when Napoleon III and his urban planner Georges-Eugène Haussmann were driving grand boulevards through the city’s slums and creating vast prestige projects. Hittorff, who would also be involved with planning the Champs Elysées and placing the Egyptian obelisk in Place de La Concorde, was praised for the technical skill of the Gare du Nord’s vast train-shed roof. His project was so ambitious that its giant metal pillars exceeded French capacity and had to be ordered in from Glasgow. The statues of women representing major and international city destinations on the station’s façade were created by leading artists of the time.“Hittorff is extremely interesting for his level of culture,” said the Paris-based architectural historian Karen Bowie, who signed the recent open letter against the latest renovation plans. “As well as an architect, he was an important archeologist, held to have made the discovery that ancient Greek temples were painted in colour. So there is very careful thought to how he used Greek-inspired ornamentation in the station.”Recent work by scholars in Cologne suggested Hittorff had planned to make more use of colour in the Gare du Nord, Bowie said, in order to “use reflected light to enhance travellers’ experience of the space”.She said it would be “a shame” to put up a series of heavy new walkways that would cut through Hittorff’s vast station space and mask the ornate back elevation. She was concerned that, unlike the current mezzanine for Eurostar passengers – designed to be temporary – the new additions could be hard to reverse.Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, the junior transport minister in Emmanuel Macron’s centrist government, insisted that the project was “necessary for the hundreds of thousands of locals and tourists who use the station daily.” He warned that Socialists at city hall were playing politics in the run-up to local elections next March.Claude Solard, of the SNCF railway company, wrote an open letter to detractors in Le Monde saying that the project would see the forecourt pedestrianised, with vast green planting on the roof, and would aim for a zero-waste policy. He said the funding model of private backers meant ticket prices would not go up.Michel Babut of the train-users association FNAUT, said that although there were some positives, such as the Eurostar area of the station being moved to the side and renovated, “this project will spend colossal sums but not improve travellers’ journeys and their experience of the station.”On the station concourse, Patrica, in her 60s, who used to work in a notary’s office in Etaples on the northern French coast, had been travelling regularly to the Gare du Nord for 40 years. “I love the station building, although it does need more toilets,” she said. “But I don’t think it needs more shops. People are so rushed these days, they just want peace and quiet.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5a7100613ee132932ba9cfff24776c9b789e5a1/0_223_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35f27db8fb814383c3b82ea22905cc44","title":"10 timeless fashion trends that never date","story":"Iconic staples rule the catwalk this season.

But we still have a long way to go Nyong’o referred to colourism as “the daughter of racism”, explaining that she was once told at an audition that she was “too dark” for television.Skin-tone-based prejudice used to be a subject only discussed in whispers within minority communities, but slowly, and thankfully, that is changing. In a recent episode of the hit Channel 4 series Black-ish – Black Like Us – two lead characters discover that the lighting used for their daughter’s school photograph didn’t work on dark skin tones, and she has faded into the shadows. Beyoncé’s ode to dark skin on the Lion King soundtrack, Brown Skin Girl, has also helped colourism increase its visibility in the mainstream.This is a conversation that is still burgeoning – and not always taken seriously. Perhaps that is because colourism is perceived as an intra-community issue for minorities to bicker about among ourselves. After all, the general consensus is that it’s only we who bother with the specificity of shade-based bigotry.But it bears repeating: colourism is a seed that was planted by white supremacy and watered within our own communities. Its roots still lie very much in the mainstream: the idea that we live on a colour-coded spectrum in which the lighter you are, the whiter (and therefore, better) you are is replicated in wider, whiter society every day.From the overrepresentation of lighter-skinned actresses in Hollywood to the near-invisibility of dark-skinned female musicians, darker skin is quietly denigrated outside our communities too. It’s no coincidence that several historic “firsts” for the black community were achieved by mixed-raced, fairer iniduals: Barack Obama, the first black president of the US Vanessa Williams, the first black Miss America Lana Ogilvie, the first black woman to become the face of a non-ethnic cosmetics brand Halle Berry, the first black woman to win the Academy Award for best actress.Skin tone affects employability rates, the likelihood of marriage and, most harrowingly, rates of suspension at school. With women’s worth so heavily tied to appearance and lighter skin so heavily tied to beauty standards, it is not surprising that it is usually black women who are hit hardest. The word colourism is believed to have been coined in 1982 by the Pulitzer prize-winner Alice Walker, but it has existed as long as racism has. It must be acknowledged, like any other form of discrimination."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05883a843476992db77224b7893b88ca8ace6aaa/0_216_4020_2412/master/4020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abe238724cfd85a0888da8314caef942","title":"flu jab saves lives fact more people vaccinated","story":"With winter approaching, we’re getting into the flu season – and right on cue, NHS England has announced that every primary school child in England is to be offered vaccination against it. This year’s vaccination campaign will be the biggest ever, with 25 million people being offered free vaccines, including 600,000 schoolchildren aged between 10 and 11.Children, who are given the delightful term “super-spreaders”, are particularly liable to infect others, so all of them aged between two and 11 will be offered the nasal spray vaccine in the coming weeks.Fears that a no-deal Brexit would jeopardise flu jab supplies have also been eased. Although there is a delay in supplies for those who are under 65 (older people and younger patients with chronic conditions are targeted with different jabs), most of the vaccines needed will arrive in the UK before 31 October.All this is excellent news. Flu is often thought of as nothing more than a week of feeling rotten, but it can be life-threatening, particularly for older people and anyone with an acute illness like cancer or underlying chronic health conditions, like me.In 2018 I developed flu complications that left me unable to breathe or move and on a ventilator for months. It’s left me with life-changing fatigue and pain, but in many ways I was lucky. Last year 1,700 people died of the flu – despite the fact that this was a relatively mild strain – and further hospital admissions put even greater pressure on an already overstretched NHS.And yet the solution isn’t simply making the jabs more available – it’s ensuring people actually have them. There’s long been an issue with low uptake of free flu jabs in England, and there’s a fear that immunisations are an increasingly hard sell to the public. The UK, like much of the west, is battling an anti-vaxxing movement in which social media has become a gateway for scare stories and quackery. Diseases such as measles are on the rise in England, with the UK recently losing its measles-free status with the World Health Organization because a growing number of people believe dangerous myths about vaccines.By comparison, the risk of flu is even easier to downplay. When I post a pro-flu jab link on Twitter I routinely face a response from anti-vaxxers: anything from claims that the jab once gave them a terrible flu (the jab can never give the flu, but you may have picked up germs at the GP surgery getting it) to ideas that a special diet of vegetables will do the trick instead. Others point to how the jab doesn’t immunise against every flu strain – and while that’s true, it makes no sense to reject something that gives you a good chunk of protection because it doesn’t safeguard you against everything. The year I developed flu complications, I had been vaccinated. But while it didn’t protect me that time, it had done for more than 25 years previously. I’ve had the jab ever since I was a child, and it undoubtedly helped me stay well through many winters.The social media bots designed to spread misinformation about vaccines are a particular danger, but many online are genuine people who have internalised anxieties – fears that the chatter of Facebook and Twitter easily reinforces. The backlash against professional expertise, coupled with the insistence that personal opinion trumps established facts – which we’ve seen on everything from Brexit to the climate crisis – can just as seriously chip away at consensus about vaccine safety.No one who distrusts vaccines will be won over by bullying insults or dismissing them as stupid – but support and well-funded education drives would help. Worryingly, there has been a drop in spending on flu publicity campaigns in recent years as the government’s austerity measures have been stepped up.The balance between freedom as an inidual and responsibility as a member of society is never easy, but surely no one has the right to put others at risk. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, was said to be “looking very seriously” at making vaccinations compulsory for state school pupils for diseases such as measles – although No 10 rowed back on it.When it comes to flu, greater focus must be put on NHS staff as well as workers in older people’s care homes: for instance, the former chief medical officer for England even recommends all healthcare workers who refuse the jab should wear a lapel badge to warn patients they aren’t protected. Such a solution isn’t perfect – on a crowded ward with few staff, you can’t pick and choose your nurse – but is worth trialling. Compulsory vaccinations for all NHS and care staff are a valid last resort. Those of us who are vulnerable to the worst effects of flu should at the least be able to feel safe around the very people meant to help us.Whether it’s schoolchildren or health workers, vaccine take-up is a pressing public health issue. This winter, let’s hope it’s facts that start spreading."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/127040a20816aef6a409418d24645569cd924803/0_40_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11c3e7ca4d84e2e08a58007a45f226c3","title":"the guardian view on polands election church sanctioned bigotry casts a shadow","story":"In the six years of his papacy, one of Pope Francis’s main goals has been to shift the focus of the Catholic church’s preoccupations away from policing “dogma” to an emphasis on inclusion and tolerance. The pontiff must despair of Poland.In general elections to be held this Sunday, the conservative nationalists of the Law and Justice party are likely to emerge once again as the country’s dominant political force, after four isive years in government. During a nasty, polarised campaign, the party has repeatedly referenced Catholic doctrine on marriage and the family, in order to aggressively target Poland’s LGBT community. Its chairman and most influential figure, Jarosław Kaczyński, has described the movement for LGBT rights as “a threat to Polish identity”, claiming that only Law and Justice can defend the traditional family from alien “western” values.The baleful effects of this extreme language have been all too visible on the streets of Poland’s towns and cities. During the summer, stones and bottles were thrown at around 1,000 LGBT activists attempting to stage the first-ever Pride march in the eastern city of Bialystok. Anecdotal evidence suggests a sharp rise in homophobic attacks in recent months. Municipalities have symbolically declared themselves “LGBT-free zones”. Campaigners report living in a climate of fear.The church was a vital and beloved bastion of resistance to the communist regime in Poland, which eventually fell in 1989. The country’s identity is still bound up with its Catholicism, even as much of the rest of Europe secularises at pace. But at a time when Pope Francis, albeit without altering doctrine, is attempting to develop what he describes as a “church with an open heart” (famously asking “Who am I to judge?” when questioned on the church and homosexuality), his Polish bishops appear to relish operating as the religious wing of a xenophobic, homophobic government. The Catholic faith is being used to bully and marginalise the vulnerable.If Law and Justice win a second term in office this Sunday, Europe will face another four years of grappling with the confrontational, illiberal politics of one of its larger member states. It shames the Polish Catholic church that it has given a theological stamp of approval to the kind of hateful bigotry which is nowhere to be found in the Christian gospels."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d887bb8f68b594f40327a83c435428b57da3484/0_243_6504_3902/master/6504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b6b55608bb29c976b5d461f356d8b70","title":"brexit legacy england northern ireland sectarian politics","story":"How people vote in a forthcoming UK election will depend almost entirely on whether they favour leave or remainYou could call it Ireland’s sweet revenge, and both the timing and the irony would be historically exquisite. It would come just as Boris Johnson’s reckless government tries to bully Dublin on future Irish customs arrangements and as large parts of the Tory party salivate for a no-deal Brexit that will cast the Irish peace process casually aside. But if the 2019 general election that Johnson craves takes place, it may not be long before, politically speaking, Brexit Britain comes to resemble Northern Ireland.To understand that this possible Ulsterisation of British politics is a genuinely serious prospect, step back a bit and consider the way that electoral behaviour has been evolving in Britain. Ever since 1964, political scientists, mainly based at Nuffield College, Oxford, have worked on the British Election Study (BES). For more than half a century they have tracked the decline of the old industrial-based two-party system in which general elections were fought between the Conservatives and Labour, who battled for the floating voters in the middle ground across the land.Electoral volatility was already a growing trend in the late 20th century. But Jane Green, one of the study’s authors, says electoral shocks, which have come thick and fast in the 21st century, have accelerated the process. She cites five big ones: immigration and the rise of Ukip after 2004 the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent recession the Liberal Democrats’ decision to go into coalition in 2010 Scotland’s independence referendum in 2014 and, finally, the Brexit vote in 2016. Each has reshaped politics and added to the impact of volatility.The Brexit vote is the mother and father of these shocks, not only in itself but in its prolonged duration. Even today, more than three years on, it is still creating big aftershocks. Failure to leave the EU by the original 29 March deadline helped trigger the Brexit party’s success in the EU elections, and in turn brought down Theresa May. Another such shock is likely when parliament reconvenes on 19 October after next week’s EU summit, and on 31 October, when Britain will again either leave or stay longer in the EU. What happens on the end of the month deadline will rearrange the board.Few are foolish enough to predict with certainty how a 2019 election will play out. The 2017 election saw a swing back to two-party politics but a significant reshuffling of the two parties’ electoral bases. Two years on that picture has fractured afresh, with the rise of the Brexit party and the revival of the Lib Dems. Today’s unknowns, as Donald Rumsfeld might have said, are still unknown. Tellingly, the most authoritative voice of caution comes from the dean and doyen of British political scientists, David Butler, 95 next week, who told a BES event on Tuesday that in 70 years of studying elections, “I have never felt more totally confused and uncertain” about the outcome. When Butler says that, it is like David Attenborough telling you there is a climate crisis.Nevertheless, there is now a real possibility that in the next election Brexit will become in England and Wales what the union has become in Scotland: the decisive ide in electoral behaviour. Brexit is important, salient and highly isive. Overwhelmingly, people are in one camp or the other. This would not mean that other issues, including economic ides, no longer apply at all. But these other issues would tend to be refracted through the prism of Brexit.But if Brexit is reshaping the electoral battle, it is in reality two separate battles. The Tories and the Brexit party are battling for leave voters, while Labour, the Lib Dems, Greens and nationalists battle for remainers. Very few voters sit in the middle of the road on Brexit or the cultural issues that are so closely associated with it.Remind you of anything? It should. Northern Ireland has had two electorates for decades. Parties battle in one or the other, leaving slim pickings for those who try to reach across the ide. As Geoffrey Evans, another BES author, put it this week: “British politics is no longer about the battle for the middle ground. It’s become like the Northern Ireland system.” And Evans adds a sobering further thought, that in Northern Ireland the winners are the parties that voters trust not to give in to the other side. “Could the Liberal Democrats be the Sinn Féin of all this,” he wonders.Northern Ireland’s ides are rooted in centuries of religious ide. The Brexit ide in Britain is far more recent. But it is rooted in identities and anger, too. If Brexit does become the defining issue in mid-21st-century British politics, the hope of a country coming back together could be as fragile as the dream of Irish peace now is, and just as fraught."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d27db2ed4dbdc2ca8591745ea053df89e9fce7b/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ed625e04a95592416e697ee4d829e54 700w","title":"do you work for a fossil fuel company share your experiences","story":"If you work for a fossil fuel firm, we’d like to hear from you.

Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.Those identified range from investor-owned firms – household names such as Chevron, Exxon, BP and Shell – to state-owned companies including Saudi Aramco and Gazprom.Michael Mann, one of the world’s leading climate scientists, said the findings shone a light on the role of fossil fuel companies and called on politicians at the forthcoming climate talks in Chile in December to take urgent measures to rein in their activities.“The great tragedy of the climate crisis is that seven and a half billion people must pay the price – in the form of a degraded planet – so that a couple of dozen polluting interests can continue to make record profits. It is a great moral failing of our political system that we have allowed this to happen.”The global polluters list uses company-reported annual production of oil, natural gas, and coal and then calculates how much of the carbon and methane in the produced fuels is emitted to the atmosphere throughout the supply chain, from extraction to end use. approached the 20 companies named in the polluters list. Seven of them replied. Some argued that they were not directly responsible for how the oil, gas or coal they extracted were used by consumers. Several disputed claims that the environmental impact of fossil fuels was known as far back as the late 1950s or that the industry collectively had worked to delay action.Most explicitly said they accepted the climate science and some claimed to support the targets set out in the Paris agreement to reduce emissions and keep global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.All pointed out efforts they were making to invest in renewable or low carbon energy sources and said fossil fuel companies had an important role to play in addressing the climate crisis. PetroChina said it was a separate company from its predecessor, China National Petroleum, so had no influence over, or responsibility for, its historical emissions. The companies’ replies can be read in full here.The latest study builds on previous work by Heede and his team that has looked at the historical role of fossil fuel companies in the escalating climate crisis.Heede said: “These companies and their products are substantially responsible for the climate emergency, have collectively delayed national and global action for decades, and can no longer hide behind the smokescreen that consumers are the responsible parties.“Oil, gas, and coal executives derail progress and offer platitudes when their vast capital, technical expertise, and moral obligation should enable rather than thwart the shift to a low-carbon future.”Heede said 1965 was chosen as the start point for this new data because recent research had revealed that by that stage the environmental impact of fossil fuels was known by industry leaders and politicians, particularly in the US.Heede added: “Leading companies and industry associations were aware of, or wilfully ignored, the threat of climate change from continued use of their products since the late 1950s.”The research aims to hold to account those companies most responsible for carbon emissions, and shift public and political debate away from a focus just on inidual responsibility. It follows a warning from the UN in 2018 that the world has just 12 years to avoid the worst consequences of runaway global heating and restrict temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.The study shows that many of the worst offenders are investor-owned companies that are household names around the world and spend billions of pounds on lobbying governments and portraying themselves as environmentally responsible.A study earlier this year found that the largest five stock-market-listed oil and gas companies spend nearly $200m each year lobbying to delay, control or block policies to tackle climate change.Heede said the companies had a “significant moral, financial, and legal responsibility for the climate crisis, and a commensurate burden to help address the problem”.He added: “Even though global consumers from iniduals to corporations are the ultimate emitters of carbon dioxide, the Climate Accountability Institute focuses its work on the fossil fuel companies that, in our view, have their collective hand on the throttle and the tiller determining the rate of carbon emissions and the shift to non-carbon fuels.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2220f6376f76c8c8b4578a18ce220536d70a6955/423_218_4201_2521/master/4201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1194a6cea1d44551ed8b5aabaa77e508","title":"royal society of biology photographer of the year the shortlist","story":"The RSB has unveiled the shortlist for its 2019 photographer of the year and young photographer of the year competition.

She doesn’t need to look at price tags or concern herself with waiting lists. What Moss wants in her wardrobe, Moss gets, straight away. If she wants the Paris fashion week hit dress from the cover of Vogue or the It bag on this month’s billboards, it is hers for the asking.But what has been her signature high-fashion look? Vintage, that’s what. Vintage is to Moss as Givenchy was to Audrey Hepburn and as Hermès is to Jane Birkin. It is the name in the label of her best-ever looks. The lemon-yellow dress she wore to a New York fashion week dinner in 2003, which she later reincarnated in her Topshop collection? A vintage piece by 1950s French couturier Jean Dessès. The black cocktail dress with feathered off-the-shoulder hemline she wore on the red carpet at Cannes in 1998? A vintage shantung silk piece, given a minimal 90s spin with scraped back hair and simple black strappy slingback sandals. At Glastonbury in 2005, with cut-off denim shorts and Hunter wellies? A 1970s Roncelli leather jacket.Now that it is the height of sustainable, zeitgeist cool to wear vintage, can we take a moment to acknowledge that Moss has been across this since the days when she was going out with Johnny Depp. Secondhand to her has never been second best. When she threw herself a 30th birthday party – at Claridges, in the full-on bling glare of 2004 – the look she splashed out on for the occasion was not Tom Ford for Gucci, but a dramatic retro sequinned gown with matching cape she found in a vintage store. Her passion for Vivienne Westwood’s pirate-style strapped flat ankle boots, which she first bought on Portobello market, has lasted longer than any of her relationships. When she wants to look special, she goes vintage.What can mere mortals learn about wearing vintage from how Moss wears vintage? There are some nuggets of wisdom in a book she has edited, Musings on Fashion and Style: Museo de la Moda, in collaboration with the Chilean fashion museum. Firstly, she looks at the garment, not the label. When she shops for the 1970s peasant-style dresses she loves, she sifts the racks for the colours that look right, first of all. And when she bought that lemon-yellow dress, the one that would have broken the internet had it been possible then, she didn’t know who Dessès was. Second, Moss knows what suits her. Bias-cut dresses, for instance, are a vintage-shop treasure, which Moss loves for being flattering, subtly sexy and easy to have fun in. In the words of Madeleine Vionnet, whose bias-cut gowns were the toast of 1930s Paris, “when a woman smiles, her dress should smile with her”.Moss has been on 30 British Vogue covers and thousands of newspaper front pages. She has made cameos on film and television, been painted by Lucian Freud and sculpted in bronze by Marc Quinn. She has a remarkable roll-call of vintage moments – and in the best of them, she’s wearing vintage.Will you often search out vintage all over the world?I always keep my eye out and try to visit vintage stores on my travels. I have found some great places that I return to whenever I can and have lots of favourites in London, too.Which pieces were you most excited to discover?I think Marilyn Monroe’s clothes.

What have you learned?I just go with my first instincts when I see something I like. It doesn’t matter to me the designer or the era, just that the item appeals to me and looks good when I try it on.Do you like the history and stories that vintage clothes contain?Yes, I love the idea that the clothes have a history and have been worn previously. Who knows what they have experienced? Also, it’s good that clothes are recycled and worn again rather than being thrown out.What have been your best finds?My original Vivienne Westwood Sex boots I found at Portobello market in the 90s.Do you keep everything?I try to, but as I wear the clothes out and about not all have survived.How did you first discover designers such as Thea Porter and Ossie Clarke?Anita Pallenberg introduced me to them.You say you would like to have lived in Paris in the 20s.

The riff on her name sparked accusations of insensitivity and cultural appropriation with the mayor of Kyoto, birthplace of the kimono, writing a critical open letter. Kardashian West has apologised for the offence caused, saying that she “had really innocent intentions”.“Cultural appropriation is about who has the power to speak,” said Jackson at the exhibition launch. Jackson, wearing a kimono over a white shirt, said she had “considered the question of whether it is appropriate for me to wear this. It is perfectly appropriate on my colleagues who are Japanese, but on me – is it different from 19th century orientalism? This is an important issue. But there is a danger that being mindful of the reverence in which the kimono is held means that it gets stuck in the past, and that denies the impact it has had on global fashion and mimimises its power to impact fashion in the future.”The exhibition will explore the 21st century revival of the kimono among young people in Japan who are rejecting the industrialised trend system of western fashion and returning to a timeless mode of dress.Seventeenth century trade between Japan and the Netherlands led to a Dutch vogue for kimono, adapted to the northern European climate with warm padding. “There was already a tradition of robes in Europe – think of Holbein’s The Ambassadors – but suddenly you get all these rich, vibrant colours and everyone wants one” said Jackson. A 1678 portrait of Dutch aristocrat Anna Elizabeth van Reede will travel to the V\u0026ampA for the exhibition, the first time it has left the ancestral castle for which it was painted. In Edwardian England, kimono became fashionable in artistic circles as a marker of bohemian taste.With its straight seams and right-angled edges the kimono, unlike most western fashion, is cut to neither trace nor exaggerate the human form. It is because “the body is irrelevant” to the kimono, says Jackson, that it is traditionally displayed on a T-shaped frame, rather than a mannequin.The impact of the kimono on western fashion has been explored in the book accompanying the exhibition by the director of the Kyoto Costume Institute, who examines how Japanese dress culture dramatically changed the course of Paris fashion.Show exhibits will include a dress designed by Alexander McQueen for Björk, immortalised on the cover of her 1997 album Homogenic, and the iconic Star Wars Jedi costume which George Lucas, an admirer of the films of Akira Kurosawa, conceived as part Buddhist monk and part samurai. Milligan Beaumont, a young designer whose graduate collection of “kimono hoodies” was bought in it entirety and taken on a world stadium tour by Christina Aguilera, will also feature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b9edaaf93bc2d78ab43b8cdcf2672d3aa2604a8/0_0_2902_3718/master/2902.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c96ccd70747b660227864ddf2d8e02eb 700w","title":"flour power meet the bread heads baking a better loaf","story":"Mechanised food factories demand ingredients that are standard, stable and easy to transport, and make products that are standard, stable and easy to transport. New wheats have been bred (and, in the US, genetically modified) for high yields and high protein content that require inputs of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. To increase efficiency, hedgerows and copses have been eliminated and farmland agglomerated into increasingly larger tracts of monoculture.From soil to plastic-packaged loaf, industrialised breads are the end product of 100 years of innovation in agriculture, manufacturing and transport, all of which prioritises efficiency and cost over nutrition and taste. Bread is the most-bought food item in the UK, but the supermarket loaf is just part of a basket of highly processed foods that we are now beginning to understand is making us fat, sick and allergic.While the big bakeries may market brown loaves under homely monikers such as farmhouse, wholegrain and multiseed, these are often distinctions without much meaning. The basic ingredient of highly processed flour is the same, even if bran or other sources of fibre are added back into the mix. More research is needed, but there is increasing evidence to suggest that gluten intolerance (not to be confused with coeliac disease, which means people cannot process gluten at all) could be caused by the extra gluten that is often added to mass-produced wholewheat products, and that the old-fashioned longer proving time – the resting time that allows yeasts to ferment the dough and make it rise – is a key factor in rendering wholegrains more digestible.Good bread needs no more than four ingredients: flour, yeast, water and salt. Wheats were once regional and adapted to the land grain was milled locally and often baked as wholegrain flour into dense loaves. In Britain and the US, most of us have not eaten this kind of bread in so many generations there is no longer even a folk memory of what it tasted like. The desire for lighter and whiter bread is steeped in history: finer, paler, sifted flour was more expensive and the province of the rich, and as such has been a enduring trend, even as flour became a bland and cheap commodity, often bleached to make it even whiter.But in the past couple of decades, new movements have begun to challenge the prevailing food culture. In the early 2000s, activist and journalist Michael Pollan wrote about how what we eat had lost its link with the land and the farmer. Leading the revolt against processed food, in 2010, Pollan came up with the line that became a catchphrase: “Don’t eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn’t recognise as food.” Dan Barber, a chef on a mission to bring back the links between sustainable farming and taste and nutrition, delivered a Ted Talk in 2008 in which he described modern industrial agriculture as “an insult to the basic laws of nature”. He and others have popularised the farm-to-table movement that is changing people’s eating habits, encouraging farmers to grow varieties for deliciousness over yield, efficiency of transport and shelf life.In 2011, the geneticist Steve Jones founded the Bread Lab in Oregon, bringing farmers, millers, brewers and bakers together to develop new grains that emphasised taste. In 2014, Jones suggested the supermarket loaf should be called “American” or “processed bread”, to distinguish its mass-produced identity and nutritional characteristics. He told me he does not like to be in the same room as white flour. Meanwhile, a sourdough movement bubbled up in San Francisco, championing the resurgence of the traditional method of leavening bread using natural starters that harness a complex web of ambient bacteria and fungi, rather than strong modern yeasts bred to inject air into almost anything.The great food writer Julia Child once said British white bread tasted “like Kleenex”. Maybe that is why we load our white sliced toast with so much jam and chocolate spread and peanut butter. Wholegrain, sourdough bread is a very different beast crunchy, crusty, chewy, with a complex taste that is rich, nutty and tangy. Quite often, I find a couple of thick slices, spread with a generous swathe of butter, a satisfying lunch.The revival of ancient varieties of wheat is inspiring a new movement of agronomists, farmers, millers and bakers in the UK. They are coming together to develop and grow new kinds of wheat that do not need dousing with chemicals, to mill the grain in such a way as to keep taste and nutrition intact, and to bake loaves that are delicious and healthy. In the process, these artisans want to challenge the dominance of chemical agriculture and the supermarket loaf, to establish a new kind of supply chain that links our diet to nature and creates healthy communities.Bread is a basic foodstuff. It is our land and our kitchen table, family tradition and religious celebration. Our daily bread is our daily life it is economics – breadwinner, breadbaskets, breadlines it is politics – upper crust, bread and circuses, grist for the mill. As this group of growers, millers and bakers are demonstrating, bread can be revolution, too.In the 1960s, while we were falling for for the abundance of postwar produce and the convenience of the supermarket, one British plant pathologist was battling with mould. As a young researcher in East Anglia, Martin Wolfe specialised in barley mildew. At the time, the prevailing view was that science could improve on nature’s design agronomy focused on breeding grains that would produce the highest yields, and developing fertilisers and pesticides to encourage and protect them.Wolfe began to see that as soon as a new variety of barley was introduced, pathogens adapted to find a way to attack it as soon as a new fungicide was formulated, the pathogen reacted by developing resistance to it. He realised that nature was always going to win the race.He was single-minded, driven, almost obsessive his family complained that he was difficult to call away from his desk for dinner. He understood earlier than most that adding more chemicals was not a sustainable answer, and looked for different ways to grow healthy crops. He experimented with breeding varieties carrying different resistance genes. When he planted out his new varieties and mixtures, he found that infection levels fell.In the 70s, Wolfe worked with East German scientists who wanted to reduce their use of expensive foreign pesticides. By the end of the 80s, almost all their spring barley (an important crop, because the East exported malted barley to the West German brewing industry for hard currency) was being grown according to Wolfe’s techniques. But when the Berlin Wall came down, they were encouraged, like other farmers in western Europe, via subsidies and promises of high yields, to use chemical fertilisers.“I’ve always felt like a bit of an outsider,” Wolfe admitted in an interview. He was a scientist, and at first sceptical of the organic movement that emerged in the 80s, which he felt was turning back the clock. His priority was breeding new crops to tackle the environmental challenges of the future. Over the decades, Wolfe became convinced that ersity – the very thing that modern agriculture was eliminating with its herbicides and monoculture – was the key to resistance. When a pathogen attacked a genetically homogenous crop, it could wipe out a whole field.As he approached retirement, Wolfe wanted to put some of the new ideas about mixed farming practices into use. Agroforestry had begun to gain ground in the 70s when Phil Rutter, an American plant breeder, asked a big question: if nature’s dominant agriculture was trees – perennials – why had man spent 10,000 years developing annual crops? Rutter was convinced that trees such as hazel and chestnut could provide as much nutrition as cereals without having to be resown every year. His motto was: “The future of the world is nuts.”In 1994, Wolfe bought two meadows and a low-ceilinged long house in Suffolk called Wakelyns, which had a been a pig farm, then a dog-breeding site. Wolfe drew up elaborate plans for avenues of hazel, willow and a mixture of fruit, nut and timber trees. In the lanes in between the trees, he would grow annual crops: vegetables, cereals, legumes. Wakelyns was always imagined as an experimental agroforestry farm, “a rather expensive personal hobby”, as his son, David, put it, not a going concern. It soon became a centre for real research.At first, the saplings, planted in mud with protective plastic rabbit-proof sleeves, looked thin, vulnerable and unimpressive. Visiting farmers shook their heads, wondering why land was being wasted by planting trees on it. “No experiment ever fails,” Wolfe liked to say. As the trees grew and projects proceeded, visitors were drawn to Wakelyns to see for themselves one of the best examples of agroforestry in Europe. Wolfe walked them through his lanes of crops, his white hair glowing like a nimbus, backlit by the sun, explaining the how the trees, with their long roots, were able to draw nutrients from deep in the soil, which the annual crops also benefited from, via fungal networks in the soil. “There is an idea that crops suffer from competition with trees,” he told one interviewer, “but it is not true – they are sheltered and protected by trees.”In 2000, Wolfe created a very special crop. With the help of plant breeders and the scientists from the Organic Research Centre, Wolfe took 20 varieties of wheat that had been doing well under low-input conditions in the UK, half chosen for their quality – their high protein and gluten contents – half for their high yield, and cross-bred them every which way, resulting in 190 new crosses. Normally, a breeder would look at these plants and select for the traits they wanted. But this time seeds from all 190 were thrown together in a field, grown, harvested and reseeded together for several years. Wolfe called it YQ, for “yield” and “quality”.Whereas selection ordinarily narrowed the genetic pool, as with inbreeding dogs, this method maintained it. The genetic ersity in this crop meant the wheat was not only resistant to pathogens, but also tolerant of varying growing conditions. The yield of YQ was never going to match that of high-yield wheat in a good year, but over time, Wolfe showed, its yields through wet or dry or pestilential years, when whole fields of homogenous wheat could be wiped out, were compellingly consistent.Wolfe milled his YQ grain into flour in a small electric stone mill in his barn. His wife, Ann, made cakes and pastry with it, and everyone loved its rich, nutty taste. But Wolfe had not yet found a baker who would turn it into bread.Last February, I drove north to meet one of the foremost of a new generation of British artisanal bakers – Kim Bell, who started The Small Food Bakery in Nottingham five years ago and, in 2018, won a prestigious BBC Food and Farming award. I found Bell cleaning up at the end of the day. Hale, with floury hands, and her hair tied up in a cloth bandana, she gave me a bottle of house-made rhubarb kefir as she finished vacuuming the ovens. She is a proper baker – a mix of passion and exhaustion. When she finally sat down, I said: “One day you’ll have someone else to do the washing up!” Bell shook her head. “We don’t have anyone who comes in to do menial work. We all do it ourselves.” This, she explained, was deliberate, part of a policy to encourage autonomy and responsibility. She wanted each baker to be mindful of resources: energy, time and hot water.I ate one of her cinnamon buns: sticky, soft and crunchy all at once sweet from the chestnut honey and sour from the tang of the naturally fermented dough. Every mouthful was differently delicious.Bell had gone to art school but didn’t want to be an artist. For many years, she worked with her father in a contracting business, specialising in installing coffee shops and minimarkets in petrol stations. They were successful, but she found the world of mass-market retail depressing and wasteful. Bell is the kind of person who always has a dozen projects on the go and a large cast of collaborators. She was often cooking on the side, filling in at a friend’s pub, catering a wedding or baking for the Women’s Institute market. At one point, she got involved with helping a friend open a cafe.She also started reading Michael Pollan and Dan Barber, and discovered the US food movement linking sustainable agriculture and deliciousness. She went to listen to a talk by Andrew Whitley, the godfather of the British sourdough movement, who had opened the first organic bakery in the UK – the Village Bakery in Melmerby in Cumbria – in 1976. “Andrew was selling the idea of a bread revolution where we use wild yeasts and we know where our grain comes from.”Bell is a very good baker she is also a political baker. Learning about soil depletion and disease and social justice, she was appalled, and then galvanised. “It just all came together for me: there is a problem in our food system and we need to fix it.”Thoughts converged, and events conspired: a small kitchen-cafe came up for hire in an artists’ co-op in Nottingham, and in 2014, Bell found herself with a space and an oven. Opening a bakery seemed an obvious way to challenge all that she felt was wrong with the industrial food system, a sourdough gauntlet to throw down in opposition to the supermarket loaf in its plastic sleeve.“I flung my doors open one day with absolutely no fanfare,” Bell remembered. “I didn’t announce it. There was no sign. I had one customer the whole day. And she was gluten intolerant.” Bell had no formal baking training she did what most new artisan bakers do: she tried to copy the Tartine Bakery in San Francisco, with its much-lauded and Instagram-famous crumb (bread’s interior texture) full of big holes, and its sharply crunchy crusts.“You think flour is a stable ingredient,” Bell explained to me as she opened a few bags of different flours for me to feel and taste. “But if it’s done right, it’s living and alive.” I held some flour in my palm and saw how it clumped a little when I compressed it – the measure of its moisture. The flour I had unthinkingly always used is really only an inert powder of indefinable shelf life, whereas this kind of whole grain, containing the oils of the germ, lasts a few months before it can go rancid. Bell is one of the vanguard of bakers in the UK trying to make better flour and tastier, more satisfying loaves. Part of the taste comes from using different grains – the ancient progenitors of modern wheats, like spelt, einkorn and emmer, or cereals such as rye, buckwheat, barley and oats – and part from the lactic tang of the “starter”, the natural leavening ferment made from a flour-and-water paste and ambient yeasts.When Bell first started the bakery she used organic flour from Shipton Mill, a British miller that provides high-quality blends of flour. But she wanted to understand more about the products she was using, where they came from, how they were grown she wanted, as part of the mission and identity of the bakery, to source ingredients locally. She soon found someone who was milling organic flour in a windmill only 40 miles away.After working for years in the corporate world, Paul Wyman and his wife, Fari, bought the refurbished windmill at Tuxford 14 years ago, pretty much on a whim. The learning curve was steep. Wyman had to figure out the hard way the difference between “milling wheat” and “feed wheat” fit for animals (it has a different protein content a lot of bakers are used to working with higher protein contents because it creates a more open, structured crumb), and there were plenty of mechanical problems and sudden wind gusts, but, he admitted, “slowly, I became a pretty good miller”.His wife presides in the tea room, selling cakes and scones made with flour he has milled, to showcase how different the taste can be. (I bought two bags of his Tuxford Gold and made everything from pasta to pastry with them the difference in quality was clear – it was richer, more complicated, more interesting.)There is something quite extraordinary about the sheer physicality of a working windmill. The big canvas sails turned as gracefully and powerful as a tall masted ship. Inside the shafts and chains and pulleys and wooden toothed gears clanked and thumped as the iron spindle revolved, running through the centre of the two heavy grinding stones. People have been grinding grain into flour in this way for thousands of years.Jones convenes an annual symposium, the Grain Gathering in Oregon, which brings together bakers, breeders and millers from all over the world. Jones is a global leader developing new wheats and other cereals tailored to the varied needs of bakers, brewers, farmers and consumers. Recently, the Bread Lab launched a new sliced loaf developed to appeal to consumers brought up on soft and sweet American bread.Kim Bell met Jones several times at the Grain Gathering. For the past two years, she has organised a UK version, the Grain Lab, a two-day event bringing together 150 farmers, millers and bakers from 14 countries to discuss issues of marketing, transport and cost.A supermarket loaf might cost about £1, a loaf from an artisanal bakery three or four times that. Inevitably, the price of sourdough has given it an elite, middle-class foodie tag. Supermarket bread sells at wafer-thin margins, and big bakeries operate on giant economies of scale small bakeries have to contend with high rents and labour costs, expensive organic ingredients and a time-intensive process. Bakers defend the value of their loaves, their high satiety (one thick slice fills you up quite happily) and lower waste: supermarket bread is so undervalued that almost half of it is thrown away. Increasingly, we are beginning to understand the real costs of an industrialised food supply, not borne by the agro-food industry, but by the taxpayer. A study for the Sustainable Food Trust in 2017 suggested that when you have factored in the health costs of obesity and diabetes, environmental clean-up and subsidies, the real cost of our food is double what we pay for it in a shop.Bell and others are trying to put together local networks of supply, to create a new kind of grain economy inevitably, their efforts come up against the problem of how we value benefits that we can feel, rather than count. Bell told me that the connections she makes are often personal and unexpectedly moving (for example, when farmers taste bread baked with grain they have grown for the first time). For Bell, the quality of her relationships is as important as the quality of the ingredients.One day, more than three years ago, Josiah Meldrum, an organic farming activist, walked into Kim Bell’s bakery with a bag of YQ flour. Meldrum, co-founder of Hodmedod’s, a Norfolk company selling and championing British legumes, was a close friend of Martin Wolfe and keen to help him get bakers interested in YQ. He told Bell the story of YQ and asked her if she would try baking with it, explaining apologetically that YQ had a relatively low protein content. Most bakers would have been put off, but Bell smelled its toasty nuttiness and was intrigued.Her first efforts produced tough, dense loaves, or the dough became a puddle of unshapeable slop. Bell tried varying the proportions of starter, upped hydration levels, reduced the temperature, mixed it vigorously instead of gently. “It was just trial and error really.” She wanted to bring out the flavour of the wheat. Finally, she was satisfied and had a domed loaf with a dark umber crust and a russet interior of soft, pillowy crumb that she could take to show Wolfe at Wakelyns.Bell was nervous: “He’s a bit famous.” But they ended up spending all day talking. “He was delighted, because he had been working on this project for 20 years and scientists were fascinated by it, but he couldn’t seem to get a baker to bake with it.” Bell and Wolfe recognised in each other the other half of an equation. For Bell, the YQ wheat represented “everything we had been thinking about in the bakery, ersification and decentralisation, resonated back down to the seed.”Since the early 20th century, seeds that are sold commercially have had to be legally registered according to variety. In this way, buyers are protected and breeders can receive royalties on plants they have spent time and money developing. Accordingly, seeds and plant varieties must conform to certain criteria for uniformity and stability. But YQ is genetically thousands of different varieties of wheat, known as a “population”. As such, it could not be legally registered, or traded, in Europe.When Bell fell in love with YQ and its story, Wolfe had been growing it for almost 15 years. In the US, they were continuing to develop populations, as were a few agronomists in France, Germany and Italy. But generally, these were a new, untested type of crop. Between 2007 and 2013, YQ went on a tour around Europe, to see how it would grow in different climates. The results showed that even in varying weather conditions and soils the overall yield of YQ was remarkably stable.In the meantime, Wolfe went back and forth between Brussels and Westminster to lobby for an exception to the EU regulations that would allow YQ to be sold. Finally, in 2014, he was successful, and in July 2017 YQ seed, officially called the ORC Wakelyns Population, was the first population wheat to go on sale in Europe.Bell wanted to use YQ flour at the Small Food Bakery, but she needed to find a farmer to grow it. She asked Paul Wyman at Tuxford Mill if he had any ideas. Wyman sourced a lot of his organic wheat from John and Guy Turner, who had a family farm in Lincolnshire, 40 minutes down the A1. He suggested giving them a call.The Turner brothers at Grange Farm are fourth-generation farmers with 100 hectares (250 acres). Over the decades, they had watched other small farmers around them struggle and sell up. So, in 2001, they decided to go organic. “Basically, we’ve been holding on by our fingertips for the last 30 years,” John Turner told me. They had begun to send their wheat to Paul Wyman when they were looking for a way to sell a few tonnes of extra grain. When Bell asked if they would be interested in planting YQ the brothers said: “OK. Why not?”“Over the winter, we weren’t too sure about it at all,” Guy told me. “It was quite a spindly, thin crop. But then in the spring, when the weather warmed up, it just absolutely took off. You could almost sit at the edge of the field and watch it grow.”Bell continued to champion YQ to other bakers and gave baking demonstrations with it at her Grain Lab. Ben Mackinnon at E5 Bakery in London Fields, which mills its own flour at its premises under a railway arch, grew up on a farm near Wakelyns, knew Wolfe (he once spent a month digging up potatoes for him) and said he would take four tonnes. Turner was delighted. The only problem was how to get the grain to London. Turner suggested he take a load on a trailer hooked up to his 4X4. He soon got lost in the narrow streets. “I felt like a real hick from the sticks,” he said, laughing. I said he was doing something that probably hadn’t been done in 150 years: a farmer transporting his own grain into central London to be milled.When I visited E5 in April, they had almost run out of the Turner’s YQ and had begun to source it from another farmer in Essex. Word had gone around, artisanal bakers were excited by the YQ story and its flavour almost the whole 2018 crop had sold out.Martin Wolfe died after a short illness in March. We had been in touch and he had invited me to come to see his farm. Two weeks after his death, his son David and Josiah Meldrum kindly met me at Wakelyns. It was a brittle spring day, bright spots of sun in a cold wind.They showed me Martin’s office – a mess of papers, slides of mildewed barley leaves, a nest of wires on the floor, chainsaw parts. In the sheds and barns, there were tractors and combine harvesters and all sorts of Heath Robinson-esque machinery he had modified for his experiments. “There’s not much you can’t do with a Ribena bottle,” David laughed, pointing to plastic bottle taped to a stick. “Everything tied up with baler twine,” Meldrum added. “Martin would never let a good idea be stymied by not having the right equipment.”And here were the avenues of trees, and between them alleys of clover and blades of green YQ. The trees were splotched with green and white and pink blossom, 40 kinds of apple, multiples of pear, plum. There were the prints of muntjac deer and hares in the mud and thrushes warbling in the hazel.We walked through a hedge and came out on to a lane as a blast of raw wind, unchecked by trees, blew into our faces. Before us was a 40-hectare expanse of wheat on the neighbouring farm, as evenly green as a billiard table. The contrast between the variegated beauty of Wakelyns agroforestry and this conventionally farmed field could not have been more stark.We are only beginning to understand the importance of ersity and the complex systems that plants – and animals, and us – need to thrive. In an interview, Martin Wolfe once argued that value should be accounted not just according to the cash received for a crop, but to the effect of the plants on the soil and carbon sequestration, and wider effects “on mood, on beauty, on community”. The story of YQ spins a narrative from soil health to grain resistance to nutritious flour to tasty bread, and it also describes a group of people working together to create a local food network that nourishes a community.“Martin was always full of crazy ideas,” said his son. We walked to the end of a grassy meadow. His wife Ann’s grave was marked with a simple stone among stands of daffodils. In April, Martin was buried next to her.As a result of his lobbying, YQ wheat will receive legal status to be traded from the EU in 2021. Before he died, Bell told me: “I’m buoyed by Martin. Last year he said to me: ‘Kim, it’s happening, I’m seeing it for the first time in my life. It’s going to come. Things are changing.’”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/057d479adf10c7f81764bd28f9a6afc92ec55881/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=54806bfebf7a372b78dcaf558880890b","title":"euro 2020 qualifiers 10 things to look out for","story":"Prague steels itself for England’s fans, Ireland may have a new hero in Aaron Connolly and Scotland are desperate to find goalsIn what looks certain to resemble the world’s most unedifying stag party, an estimated 6,000 England fans will descend on Prague to watch Gareth Southgate’s team take on the Czech Republic. Unsurprisingly designated as a “high risk” fixture, this Friday night game will attract no shortage of thirsty visitors to the Czech capital, hellbent on making a weekend of it in a city renowned for the cheapness of its beer and myriad other nocturnal delights. Scheduled to kick off at 8.45pm local time, when more patriotic fans will have had all day to occupy the city’s Old Town Square, get liquored up and perform their traditional repertoire of ditties, it is difficult to imagine the local constabulary will be kept idle following Uefa’s refusal to move the game to a more suitable day or time. While many England fans are perfectly well-behaved, anti-social behaviour of the kind seen in Amsterdam and Porto on recent excursions seems dismally inevitable. “You’re part of our team, make the country proud,” said Gareth Southgate, in the FA’s attempt to get in front of the problem by releasing a video entitled Don’t Be That Idiot. Somebody will almost certainly be that idiot and, if recent history tells us anything, they are unlikely to be alone. BGMick McCarthy’s second coming as Republic of Ireland manager got going in earnest in March when his team played with impressive vibrancy at home to Georgia, though they only won 1-0. Goals, you see, remain extremely hard to come by for Ireland. But a solution may have emerged: Brighton’s Aaron Connolly, fresh from scoring twice against Spurs last weekend, could make his senior international debut in Tblisi on Saturday. If he shows the same sharpness that he did against Tottenham, then Ireland could take a big step towards Euro 2020 qualification, and young Connolly will be hearing more of that ‘new Robbie Keane’ talk. PD• Georgia v Ireland, 2pm SaturdayAnything less than a haul of four points from games at Slovakia and at home against Croatia over the coming days is likely to end any chance Wales have of qualifying for Euro 2020, although they could still be thrown a lifeline via the Nations League. Suffering from discomfort to his adductor, Aaron Ramsey, arguably a more important player for the Welsh than even Gareth Bale, is out of the Slovakia game. Ryan Giggs could be forced into a tactical change and the thinking by Danny Gabbidon and Iwan Roberts on Elis James’s Feast Of Football podcast was that Giggs needs to avoid playing the brand of expansive football he prefers in charge of making his team more difficult to beat. With this in mind, playing five at the back with two midfielders sitting directly in front of them was mooted as a potential solution. Whatever Giggs decides, a very talented generation of Welsh players is in danger of being wasted and the results of the next two games could have a major say in the future of a young manager who has been far from convincing during his tenure so far. BGDarlings of the last European Championship, Iceland need to pull out some big results if they are to reach Euro 2020. They are third in Group H, behind an exciting young Turkey team and France, who thrashed them 4-0 earlier in the group. On Friday they host Les Bleus, who will be without the injured Paul Pogba and Kylian Mbappé but still have no shortage of options. Didier Deschamps could, for instance, use Mbappé’s absence to give Wissam Ben Yedder his most meaningful cap to date. The striker, who joined Monaco in the summer and has been as prolific there as he was at all his previous clubs, has had to wait a long time for international recognition but, at 29, he is still young enough and good enough to make an impact. He would boost his chances of appearing in an international tournament if he helps France beat Iceland on Friday and Turkey three days later. PD• Iceland v France, 7.45pm FridayWhile Scotland’s rugby players scored 61 without reply against Russia at the Rugby World Cup, their footballing counterparts would gladly settle for victory by a far slimmer margin when they are entertained in Moscow on Thursday. Scotland trail Russia, who are second in Group I behind Belgium, by nine points with four games remaining and their hopes of qualifying via any other route than the play-off place they earned through the Nations League have evaporated. In Ryan Fraser, John McGinn, Andy Robertson, Scott McTominay and John Fleck Scotland have decent players, but their inability to score goals remains aconcern. The six forward players picked by Steve Clarke squad have just eight international goals between them and urgently need to improve that tally ahead of those play-offs so many Scottish hopes are pinned on. BGSecond behind Germany in a group that also contains the Netherlands, Northern Ireland’s remaining fixtures in Group C could scarcely be more difficult. Following their trip to Amsterdam they travel to the Czech Republic for a friendly, before completing their qualifiers against the Dutch at home and Germany away in November. Michael O’Neill will have to make do without Norwich left-back Jamal Lewis, who has pulled out with a knee injury, but the manager remains upbeat about his team’s chances of doing enough in successive qualifiers against the Netherlands to not have to concern himself with a potential route to the finals through the Nations League play-offs. “We are in a double-header with Holland and I believe if we get four points we will qualify,” he said. Having made his first international start in defeat against Germany last time out, Linfield striker Shayne Lavery could be the manplaying up front faced with a defence marshalled by Virgil van Dijk, as O’Neill has hinted the 20-year-old’s pace and intelligence could be a key weapon in a battle against one of the world’s best defenders. BGSwitzerland could have already secured their qualification for Euro 2020, instead they are set for a tense finale in Group D: and they have not coped well with tense finales so far. In their first match, at home to Denmark, they blew a three-goal lead in the last six minutes and in their last outing, in the Republic of Ireland, they looked comfortable before conceding an 85th-minute equaliser and hanging on for a point. They face those two countries again in the next few days, starting with a trip to Copenhagen on Saturday. Xherdan Shaqiri has chosen to remain in international exile but manager Vladimir Petkovic has recalled Stephan Lichtsteiner after omitting him for the trip to Dublin. Apparently he values the 35-year-old’s experience. “He is still our captain and leader,” said Petkovic of the Augsburg defender, without saying whether Lichtsteiner will actually play. PDFinland have never qualified for a major tournament. It’s somewhat of an annoyance for a nation of over five million people who gave football the supremely talented Jari Litmanen. Even tiny Iceland have beaten them to the punch. But having assumed a strong position in Group J – they’re second behind Italy – they will never have a better chance of enjoying a summer party themselves. Markku Kanerva’s side have won four and lost two (both to Italy) but now it’s crunch time. They face Bosnia-Herzegovina and Armenia next, the two teams directly below them. They travel to the Bilino Polje Stadium in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Saturday. With Norwich’s in-form Teemu Pukki leading the line, Kanerva’s compact system is well set up to pick off their inconsistent opponents on the break. Finland have not conceded a goal against any team except Italy and Pukki has been just as lethal in qualifying as he has in the Premier League, scoring five in his last six. If he can continue his hot streak over the next few days, Finland’s long wait for some summer fun could soon be over. GBGoing into their game against Slovakia last time out, Hungary were pretty much two wins from Euro 2020. Now, after a 2-1 loss, qualification from Group E looks unlikely. Hungary did beat a sluggish Croatia in Budapest in their previous group encounter, and looked impressive in doing so. But with Hungary distinctly lacking in inidual quality, it’s the sum of their parts that makes this Hungarian apparatus tick. And when two or three of those parts falter, the whole machine malfunctions, as evidenced against Slovakia. Things don’t look like changing in Croatia either, with very few of Hungary’s key men finding any kind of form at club level this season. Yet Hungary are an odd side full of players unheard of in western Europe, but who are prone to big performances in big games. Croatia are massive favourites, but Hungary have refound a quality of turning up when it matters most under Italian coach Marco Rossi. And with Croatia looking decidedly inconsistent since the World Cup, maybe this isn’t as improbable as first thought. TMAndorra have played 55 European Championship qualifiers and lost 55 European Championship qualifiers. It’s not pretty but maybe, just maybe, the tiny principality (population 76,965) could end that ugly losing streak against Moldova at home. Their visitors are the one nation that have a worse defensive record than them, having shipped 17 goals in six Group H qualifiers to Andorra’s 14. Moldova have managed to win once, 1-0 at home against Andorra, but if ever there was a chance for Koldo Álvarez to take a point – or even three – in a Euro qualifier, it is at the Estadi Nacional on Friday night. It would help if they could score a goal, mind. They haven’t managed that in six Euro 2020 qualifiers but even a 0-0 draw would be enough to make history.

Yet on this particular Monday morning, almost two years ago, King couldn’t exit the roundabout.“It was like I was possessed, my body was telling me not to go to work,” she says. “Instead, I turned around and drove to my GP.”King was burned out. Her job of 17 years at an international manufacturing company, where she managed their accounts, office and IT, was sapping the life out of her, largely due to a “micromanaging boss”.“I was very emotional, teary and agitated at work I had a short fuse,” she says.“It really hit home to me when someone said to me, ‘You know, you’re such a different person outside of work to who you are at work.’”King, who is based in Victoria, quit the role almost two years ago and now runs her own small business.But the effects lingered.“Even three months after I quit, I found myself thinking, ‘I hate Sundays’, then I realised, ‘No, I don’t anymore.’”A 2018 report for the Centre for Future Work at the Australia Institute found that Australian workers are completing 312 hours of unpaid overtime per year, which adds up to two months per worker annually.“The majority of people in corporate Australia are living that dash-for-cash philosophy, and we are no longer working a standard week and having weekends off to enjoy downtime,” says Stuart Taylor, workplace expert and founder of corporate resilience training company Springfox.“There is a sense of always being ‘on’ even when you’re not actually at work.”An unrelenting workload was also familiar to Australia’s colonial antecedents.In 1856, Melbourne stonemasons marched to Parliament House to demand an eight-hour day, marking the beginning of a series of progressive labour laws that enshrined workers’ rights to clock off at a reasonable time.While these protections have been preserved to varying degrees in contemporary workplace agreements, many employees are nevertheless working 19th-century hours at the expense of their mental and physical wellbeing.“These days, the people who get paid the most are those who are working the most hours,” says  Michael Leiter, a professor of industrial and organisational psychology at Victoria’s Deakin University.“It used to be those who worked the most hours were low-paid people trying to make a living.”In a sign of growing concern over the increased incidence of workplace burnout, the World Health Organisation recently added burnout to a list of occupational phenomenons, although it stopped short of labelling it a disease.WHO defines burnout as being characterised by exhaustion, cynicism or detachment from one’s job, and reduced professional efficacy at work.This chimes with King, who used to love her job and got on well with her previous manager.“But the new manager made me feel so devalued and like my opinion didn’t matter, even though I had seen the company grow over many years,” she says.Leiter has been studying burnout since the 1980s, and says the global nature of the business world has chipped away at Australia’s standard working hours.While burnout is “more intense” in the US, owing to precarious healthcare and higher levels of student debt, Australians are suffering too, he says.“There are definitely some people in Australia who are working their allotted hours and then they go home,” Leiter says.“However I think there is a significant slice in Australia, on the low and high wage-end of the scale, who are working ridiculous hours.”As Leiter, points out, burnout seems to affect those earning at the extreme ends of the spectrum: commercial lawyers working 100 hours a week as well as underemployed gig economy workers who struggle to earn a minimum wage ferrying delivery food to the same corporate lawyers too busy to cook.“The gig economy is totally hostile to a unionised framework, and then at the higher end of the pay scale if you want to compete globally, you have to scramble all the time,” Leiter says.Which speaks to one of the common features of burnout: an overwhelming sense that your work life, your career, is out of your control.A recent study by researchers from Montreal University tracking 2,026 people – half of whom were women – for four years, found that women were more likely to burn out because they had less authority or control over their work than men.“People have a real need for that autonomy. And by autonomy I don’t mean, ‘I can do whatever I like’, it’s about that feeling of making something happen as opposed to being acted upon.”This was certainly the case for King, who felt worn down by a lack of agency.“When my manager wanted something done, he wanted it done straight away,” she says,“If I wanted to put in a new procedure, he wouldn’t allow it and always wanted it his way even if it wasn’t the best.”Taylor has worked with scores of corporates to help build resilience in stressful situations and says both men and women, senior or junior, can feel they lack control.“I know a lot of high-ranking executives who say they feel they have no control over what the board is doing,” Taylor says.If your workplace is not allowing workers any freedom whatsoever, then maybe it’s time to look for another job, Taylor suggests.“It may not be easy and it may take a while, but starting the process of looking is part of taking some control back,” he says.How invested employees feel in their work can also be the difference between exhilaration and exhaustion. “Within reason, doing work that really matters does not burn people out as quickly and, in fact, it often energises them,” Leiter says.And the problem, according to Leiter, is that many people are pulled away from work they enjoy to perform soul-crushing administrative tasks. “Technology gets a bad rap, but the problem with technology is that it allows employers to impose all kinds of administrative nonsense, such as compliance training, filling out forms, online time sheets,” he says.“This meaningless work exhausts people, and it makes them more cynical.”Leiter notes that millennials are more likely to feel the effects of burnout compared with other demographics, with a viral Buzzfeed article, “How millennials became the burnout generation”, capturing the mental load many young Americans feel.It appears to be no different in Australia, with a stress and wellbeing survey conducted by the Australian Psychological Society finding those aged 18 to 25 consistently report lower levels of wellbeing.“It’s a vulnerable time for burnout when you first start work as you’ve usually come from university or some form of training, which is more idealistic,” Leiter says.“So there is a conflict between the reality and the idealistic vision of work.”The tech-heavy aspect of much of modern work is not helpful for millennials either, according to Leiter.“While information technology opens access to resources that further a person’s work, it also opens users to distractions and to administrative busy work that will hurt their productivity in the long run,” he says.In King’s view, far too many of us have merged our identities with what we do for a living. “I honestly think a lot of people are lost and work is feeding people’s self-worth,” she says. “After all, you don’t have time to realise you’re unhappy if you’re working all the time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/381348d51dda4b8896a972a74cb371ae4ae1a836/0_0_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13fe050218367e873d056851470e5f0d","title":"three ministers make top 10 in list of most influential uk asians","story":"Sajid Javid tops power list, with Priti Patel second and Treasury secretary Rishi Sunak seventhThree members of the cabinet have made the top 10 of the list of the 101 most influential Asians in Britain, which is topped by Sajid Javid for a second successive year.Despite failing to become prime minister, Javid’s elevation to chancellor from home secretary ensured he beat his successor at the Home Office, Priti Patel, who has risen 36 places from last year into second.The full GG2 power list will be announced on Thursday night by the Asian Media Group (AMG).Javid, the first Asian to hold one of the great offices of state, is the son of a Pakistani immigrant bus driver, like the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, whom he deposed from the top of the list last year.“I’m honoured to be recognised on the GG2 power list again and I am proud to live in a Britain where anyone can become chancellor, whatever their background,” Javid said.“Each person on this year’s power list has their own story to tell, but the example they set to young Asian women and men is helping to create a better and brighter future for Britain. I commend and congratulate them all.”Despite being second-generation migrants, Javid and Patel have both attracted controversy for their language around immigration. Javid was criticised for referencing the race of criminals when tweeting “Asian paedophiles” in reference to the conviction of a Huddersfield grooming gang, while Patel has mocked those who champion free movement.Shailesh Solanki, the executive editor of AMG, said: “They do ide opinion but we have to recognise that they are holding two of the great offices of state. The Asian community – we are not a monolithic bloc, we have different views. You cannot say that they do not represent the views of any Asian people.”He said that Patel “as an Asian woman will inspire another generation”, expressing pride that 10 out of the top 30 this year are woman and – for the first time – two out of the top three, challenging outdated perceptions of Asian women as being in the background.“We are seeing a steady increase in the number of women on our list,” said Solanki. “It’s a cause for celebration to see Asian women in different sectors enriching British society.”Gina Miller, born in British Guiana (now Guyana) to parents of Indian descent, completes the top three after winning a second legal challenge against the government over Brexit. Khan is down two places to fourth.This is the ninth year of the list and it features 29 new entries. The other cabinet member in the top 10 is the chief secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, up 37 places to seventh. With the country’s most senior counter-terrorism officer, Neil Basu, at five, the actor Riz Ahmed at eight and the president of the Royal Society, Sir Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, at nine, Solanki said the list’s composition had changed significantly over time.“There’s definitely more ersity of roles and professions in the list,” he said. “As a media group, we have always tried to encourage the Asian community to look beyond the traditional professions of law, medicine, business, engineering and encouraged public service.”He said the other 91 places, when revealed, would further illustrate the ersity of contributions, featuring many from the worlds of art and culture.4) Sadiq Khan, mayor of London6) Sir Rabinder Singh, court of appeal judge9) Sir Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5fca6e3685824d8b9bba53fab53c341781ad774/639_1035_5479_3288/master/5479.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1958f04b1405ebc1a149c59f682d0cef","title":"brexit and the irish border is there a solution","story":"Lisa O’Carroll and Rory Carroll tell Anushka Asthana that solving the Irish border problem is still key to a Brexit deal.

Hostile briefings flowed out of Downing Street, enraging EU officials. Both sides now admit an agreement before the European council summit next week is unlikely. At the heart of all of this, one issue has remained unresolved: the Irish border.

Experts hope the research could lead to new treatments for a common type of arthritis.Osteoarthritis, in which joints become painful and stiff, is the most common form of arthritis and is thought to cause pain in about 8.5 million people in the UK alone. It is caused by a breakdown in the cartilage that protects the ends of the bones, as well as the growth of new bone around the joint as the body tries to repair the damage.It has long been thought that adult humans are unable to produce new cartilage, unlike a number of animals, including salamanders, which can not only repair damage to joints but grow whole new limbs.Now researchers say they have found fresh evidence that adults can produce new cartilage. They say the process is more common in joints less prone to osteoarthritis, and appears to be linked to small molecules that control the regrowth of limbs in animals such as the salamander.“We like to call it our inner salamander,” said Prof Virginia Kraus, the co-author of the research from Duke University, in North Carolina.Writing in the journal Science Advances, Kraus and colleagues describe how, as proteins age, their amino acid building blocks undergo a particular chemical modification. If the rate of this chemical change is known, it is possible to work out the ratio of young to old proteins in tissue by looking at the degree to which these changes have built up.Using samples of cartilage proteins from 18 iniduals, the team found this rate of change was different for different proteins. However, cartilage proteins in the ankle typically accumulated fewer of these changes than those in the knee, and even fewer than those in hips, suggesting proteins in the ankle are younger and that the joint has a greater capacity for repair. “We suddenly started noticing that the ankle proteins tended by and large to be much younger than the same proteins in the knee and the same proteins in the hip,” said Kraus.Kraus said that might be an evolutionary hangover, noting that it was easier for animals such as salamanders to regenerate a part of a limb that is further away from their core – like a digit. Kraus said that might be because these distant body parts were more likely to be damaged in an attack that leaves the animal able to escape.Further work revealed the ankle contained higher levels of small molecules called microRNAs that play a key role in limb regeneration in animals such as salamanders.Various microRNAs have previously been linked to the development of osteoarthritis, while work in animals has suggested injections of certain microRNAs might slow osteoarthritis progression.While the latest study has limitations – including that it only looks at a subset of cartilage proteins – it adds weight to the idea that injecting human joints with microRNAs, shown by the team to be linked to cartilage protein production, might aid their repair.The team even suggests that if the other substances involved in limb regeneration in creatures such as salamanders were unpicked, it might be possible to use these in humans to trigger the regrowth of limbs. “That would be extremely exciting,” said Kraus.The findings support recent work from researchers in the Netherlands, which showed cartilage in adult humans becomes thicker when knee joints are pulled apart.Dr Fiona Watt, of the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, at the University of Oxford, said the study highlighted a possible mechanism by which cartilage repairs itself, and why some joints are more prone to osteoarthritis. She stressed it was important to carry out long-term studies looking at how such processes might change in iniduals as they develop osteoarthritis, and explore when might be best to intervene. She was cautious about injecting microRNAs into joints. “Clearly they are enhancing these proteins, but they may have off-target effects and have some sort of effect on things that you don’t want to target,” she said, adding that it was also important to investigate whether they would persist long enough if injected into a joint to produce an effect – and how long that effect would last.The idea of limb regeneration would be even more complex. “It is probably quite optimistic,” said Watt. “But I think if we could improve growth of at least a single tissue like cartilage that would be a really great start.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b3b211035b826d6e6f8f12a719f1cad2633e408/0_198_4152_2491/master/4152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=487b29048e1e8f6c678fd3f542523eda","title":"nike alberto salazar athletics","story":"“This is my body. And I can do whatever I want to it. I can push it. Study it. Tweak it. Listen to it. Everybody wants to know what I’m on. What am I on?! I’m on my bike, busting my ass, six hours a day. What are YOU on?” The full voiceover, there, from an inspirational Nike commercial from 2001, featuring the cyclist Lance Armstrong.For those who didn’t get the message with that one, Armstrong filmed another Nike ad a few years later to really push it home. “The critics say I’m arrogant, a doper, washed up, a fraud, that I couldn’t let it go,” this one brooded. “They can say whatever they want. I’m not back on my bike for them.”If you’re catching up with this millennium on tape delay, my apologies for the spoilers that follow. But Armstrong, that shining beacon of purity, was finally, finally dropped by Nike in 2012, accused of having “misled Nike”. This is really as close to athletic treason as you can get, and for a firm headquartered in a US state where capital punishment is still legal, I’m amazed it somehow doesn’t carry the death penalty yet.In order that they might save face for having been misled for so long, it was commercially vital for Nike to push the line that Armstrong was the most fantastically clever cheat in human history. He was basically the unbroken world record holder in cheating. Because the alternative is that something that was always too good to be true, in a sport we already knew was completely bent, turned out to be what many wise observers had been saying all along. Of course, “we are selectively gullible” isn’t really the Nike brand.And yet, at some point in the future – like 100 years from now or something – perhaps it will be seen as such. Back in the short term, I wonder if any corporate censure will even await Alberto Salazar, who has been banned for four years for doping violations, but who is still being supported by Nike in his legal appeals against the ruling. The critically misunderstood running mastermind behind the Nike Oregon Project, Salazar has the Nike swoosh tattooed on his shoulder (like a second-tier member of the Staines massive). So he will presumably be glad to note that a de-swooshing ceremony remains in the long grass.As Nike insisted in a statement to the BBC a few days ago, the decision on Salazar “had nothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete”. Taking gold in hair-splitting, the firm added: “As the panel noted, they were struck by the amount of care Alberto took to ensure he was complying with the World Anti-Doping Code.” Guys, they were mainly struck by the need to ban him for four years for doping violations – but go on. “We support Alberto in his decision to appeal and wish him the full measure of due process that the rules require.” Nike’s CEO sent a global email explaining that Usada “upheld three charges against Alberto, all of which were committed without an intent or effect to dope or cheat”.Indeed – and yet it’s one that basically seems to run world athletics. Seemingly half the pundits are sponsored by Nike or work for the sportswear giant, which runs its own secretive training programmes, pushing the association beyond mere conflicts of interest toward the sense that a vast percentage of the sport has basically been bought and paid by the firm in one way or another. Should any commercial company really be so powerful in sports? At what point would a governing body who understood the existential threat to athletics’ credibility start thinking about antitrust issues? How can any one firm wield so much influence, then claim to be little more than ingenues when agents of that influence are found to be cheats? These are the sorts of questions Sebastian Coe should be asking. Unfortunately, he was a Nike ambassador for 38 years, and only relinquished his role with regret, when it was pointed out that being IAAF president was a conflict of interest. He insisted it was just “noise”.Thus Nike is permitted to continue presenting itself as at once the most cynical and the most naive company in the entire world of sport. How else to explain the fact they seem to have bought Salazar’s claim that he was using his son as a lab rat to work out just how much testosterone you’d need smeared on you to test positive? That the Usada panel accepted this is what you might call intriguing that Nike did so is even more of an eyebrow-raiser.Still, Nike specialise in adverts that produce all the chills, with their Colin Kaepernick ad – which told you not to listen to “non-believers” – last month winning the Emmy for outstanding commercial. So who knows, maybe they’ll find some way to enfold even this latest scandal in a spine-tingler that sells more shoes. There is a point, not very far away, where “non-believers” will destroy athletics. But sportswear? Sportswear will be just fine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5ea502cd6f1f74058e10834e21e0212b749342b/0_285_4427_2656/master/4427.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04f610a2296a861de4e9d76979071561","title":"david pocock and wallabies teammates lead sporting charge on carbon emissions","story":"Exclusive: Pocock convinces Bernard Foley and Dane Haylett-Petty to join him in encouraging the sports industry to play a bigger role in sustainabilityWallabies flanker David Pocock, along with Rugby World Cup teammates Bernard Foley and Dane Haylett-Petty, have announced their partnership with a scheme that aims to compensate for the carbon emissions associated with travel.Earlier this year, musician Heidi Lenffer, from Australian band Cloud Control, launched FEAT. (Future Energy Artists), an initiative that would allow Australian musicians to invest in a solar farm in south-east Queensland.Lenffer was concerned about the carbon emissions generated by her group’s touring schedule and what she saw as her own contribution to the climate emergency. Now, FEAT. is opening up to other sectors and iniduals.When FEAT. was announced, Pocock responded via Instagram – “he was putting enthusiastic emoji responses on a lot of our posts,” Lenffer says – and contacted another songwriter, Jack River, who put the two of them in touch.“As an athlete, you’re in a somewhat similar position to artists in that there’s no escaping what you do requires travel, and I’m very conscious of my personal contribution,” says Pocock, who will captain the Wallabies in their final World Cup pool game against Georgia in Japan on Friday.“To see what FEAT. was doing, and to see people like Heidi getting on with it and trying to harness that energy into actually building the future we know is coming and we all want to see, but need to speed up, that was really exciting.”Lenffer says that while FEAT. started and would always be identified with the musical community, she was keen for the scheme to expand and be inclusive. “We see allies in other industries as being critical to the success of what we’re trying to do,” she says.Money invested in FEAT. is being used to buy ownership stakes in a solar farm called Brigalow, near the town of Pittsworth on the Darling Downs. The floor price for investment is low, just $5. The farm will power the equivalent of over 11,000 homes for 30 years.Pocock presented the scheme to his teammates, trying to impress upon them the carbon footprint of a major sporting tour. “It’s like any slice of the population. There are some guys who were interested in it, others didn’t really see it as an issue,” he says.“I just presented the guys with what FEAT. was doing, giving them an idea of the Wallabies’ emissions this year and suggesting we team with them as a way of investing an equivalent amount into renewable energy.”He convinced Foley and Haylett-Perry to come on board. “They’re excited about seeing solutions to these problems that we’re facing … It’s ridiculous to think that changing lightbulbs and that sort of thing is enough. Those days are over. We need a big system change.”Pocock has been a vocal campaigner about the climate emergency, and has extended that to direct action: in 2014, he was arrested in a protest against Whitehaven Coal’s Maules Creek mine in northern New South Wales.He extended his support to the wave of school strikes started by Greta Thunberg. “If you look at social change, it very seldom just happens. It ends up taking a percentage of the population actually willing to give up their freedoms and engage in civil disobedience,” he says.He also highlighted how global heating was already impacting on world sport, with a sharp message for rugby’s governing bodies. “I’m not playing rugby in Australia next year, but round one of Super Rugby is in January next year,” he says.“Can you imagine, in the last weekend of January, playing 80 minutes of rugby? That’s the way that change is going to happen in sport, when a few players get together – and our players’ unions – and say, hang on, this is an issue that’s going to affect our sport.”Asked what he would say to those who tell him to “stick to sport” – and many have – Pocock says, “first and foremost, we’re all humans, and this is a much bigger issue than sport … It’s an existential threat. Rugby is a big part of my life and I’m doing absolutely everything I can to be playing at my best to be contributing to the Wallabies working towards us winning the World Cup and taking it back to Australia, that’s what we’re all working for.“But I really believe that sport is at its best when it’s challenging society to be more inclusive, to be more forward thinking, and hopefully this is an area where sport can play more of a role, because we certainly aren’t getting the leadership from our politicians.“When young people who are too young to vote tell us their futures are on the line, you’ve got to listen to them. They’re not making it up, they’re listening to the best of the available scientific projections.

However, get a ban now that goes into the knockouts and a body blow could turn into a grievous one. How many of the top teams could go into a quarter-final fully confident without their best player banned? England without Billy or Faz? New Zealand without Beauden or Ardie? Wales missing Alun Wyn or Gareth?Now I’m not saying the bans and cards earlier in the group stages didn’t have an impact but the stakes are now considerably higher.The England v Argentina match promised so much more before the dismissal of Tomas Lavanini dissolved any contest that might have transpired. However, Argentina were already on their last chance after defeat against France and England looked in control before the South Americans were down a lock.The odds of a dismissal in my mind go up further when there is more at stake and the risks and rewards are higher. Look no further than 1995 when South Africa played Canada in their final pool fixture. Both sides needed to win to progress, a loss and an exit beckoned. Three red cards were dished out in that game.Sunday’s Japan v Scotland encounter falls into the same category. Both need to go full out and neither can worry about a quarter-final the following week that may never transpire. These games make tournaments and often it’s these last group rounds and the subsequent quarter-finals that bring with them the most excitement and pendulum-swinging periods of possibilities.To a lesser extent England v France on Saturday could provide that, the typhoon notwithstanding. This match-up always pulls on the emotions, although there has also been a fair bit of chatter about the loser of this game perhaps having an easier route towards the final.Yes, teams have reached the finals after losing but they didn’t win the one that counted. Momentum and confidence for me overrides any perceived “easier” route through the knockouts. I just cannot see it being any different this time around.I’ve been in France this week, doing some work with the federation. The mood is certainly not overly confident but, contrary to a lot of speculation, the spirit in the squad sounds high and they have some class to match England’s outstanding side. This could be a cracker and is exactly what the Red Rose need before knockout rugby commences.But the jab of adrenaline and focus that game will provide both teams isn’t on the cards for two of the pre‑tournament favourites. New Zealand and South Africa had to be on point against each other in their first match and since then have largely been able to coast the remaining three games to the quarter-finals. An argument could be made that they both lack a big game recently to get them up to the intensity a last-eight game needs, but their match-up in the opening game wasn’t that long ago and neither looked rusty, so I don’t think that’s an issue.Importantly it will also mean no risks need to be taken in selection and one obvious benefit from that is if your best players aren’t on the field then they can’t get injured and certainly cannot receive a red card. That brings with it a nice ability to rest players and rotate and begin the cycle again towards peaking for the knockouts. I can see a lot more advantages than disadvantages for both the All Blacks and Springboks and no doubt about it, they are in the box seat.Wales are through and join those two behemoths but they won’t want to lose any of the emotional energy they captured after their Australia win. However, they were pushed all the way by a Fiji team that had nothing to lose after their defeat by Uruguay. An expectant nation demanded they put in one big 80-minute performance before they look towards France 2023 and they certainly did so in the 29-17 defeat. A disjointed performance from the Welsh shouldn’t overly worry their supporters. Even so, this Fiji team haven’t got what they came to Japan for but still remain a class outfit. This tournament has been ace but the best is yet to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbd79405751a0884de459389cc812c0d618f44dc/0_78_5175_3107/master/5175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d953e418e671512efba8004d04ea2075","title":"rugby world cup tournament japan super typhoon hagibis england scotland france game live","story":"Head coach Eddie Jones says everyone is “disappointed” about the cancellation of their upcoming match against France but they “have no issue” with Rugby World Cup’s decision to cancel the game.My colleague Rob Kitson is at the same presser: “Jones says is taking his squad down to Miyazaki for the weekend to train away from the storm before relocating to Oita early next week. He says he does not want to get involved in the ins and outs of whether the tournament organisers could have reacted differently.”Andy Burke from BBC Scotland has a statement from Scottish Rugby.A spokesman for Scottish Rugby said: “With potential impact on our last Pool A fixture, Scottish Rugby fully expects contingency plans to be put in place to enable Scotland to contest for a place in the quarter-finals, and will be flexible to accommodate this.”Reaction from France Rugby, which (for those who don’t parlent francais) roughly translates to: The match between France and England on Saturday is cancelled, security is more important than anything, we encourage fans to follow all security advice.“Supporters, fans, we want to also extend our full support. The disappointment is shared.”A reminder of the stakes from Duncan Smith, sportswriter for The Scotsman publications and the i. In line with his tweet, there was a lot of emphasis on safety from the RWC officials at the press conference.

If you are a supporter, thank you. If you haven’t yet contributed, please consider supporting our independent journalism.And the press conference has ended.Alan Gilpin is answering a question about why the cancelled matches couldn’t have been moved to stadia that were used in previous games and the reporter wonders if this is because some stadia have been de-rigged and no longer have any branding visible.“It wasn’t a question of whether they’d been de-rigged, they just weren’t an option to us,” says Gilpin, who adds that given the size of the typhoon’s potential zone of impact, there were very few stadia that could be used safely.He is now being asked if “in hindsight” they should have built more flexibility into the scedule.“I don’t think so. The schedule for RWC is a complex beast - 40 pool matches in four weeks,” he says. “There is very little flexibility in the RWC match schedule, that’s why the tournament rules are as they are, we have some different opportunities in case of something similar in the knockout round.”After extensive evaluation, World Rugby and the Japan Rugby 2019 Organising Committee have announced an update regarding the predicted impact of Typhoon Hagibis on this weekend’s Rugby World Cup 2019 pool matches. This includes the decision to cancel matches on safety grounds.Based on the latest detailed information from the tournament’s independent weather experts, Hagibis is predicted to be the biggest typhoon of the 2019 season and is highly likely to cause considerable disruption in the Tokyo, Yokohama and City of Toyota areas throughout Saturday, including likely public transport shutdown or disruption.As a result, World Rugby and the Japan Rugby 2019 Organising Committee have taken the difficult, but right decision to cancel matches in the affected areas on safety grounds. The impacted teams have been informed and are understanding. For matches that do not go ahead as scheduled, two points will be awarded to each team in line with tournament rules.It is an exceptional, complex and rapidly evolving situation and team and public safety is the number one priority. This has been central in all decision-making in partnership with the tournament’s weather information experts, host cities, venues and teams.Based on the latest detailed weather information, the following update is provided:Pool D match between Australia and Georgia in Shizuoka at 19:15 JST to be played as scheduledThe decision to cancel matches has not been taken lightly and has been made in the best interests of public, team, tournament personnel and volunteer safety, based on expert advice and detailed weather information. While we have extensively explored all options, public and team safety was our utmost priority as well as ensuring a consistent, fair and equitable outcome for all teams. All fans with tickets for a cancelled match will receive a full refund for the face value of their match tickets.Every effort is being made to ensure Sunday’s matches will be played as scheduled. A thorough assessment of venues will take place after the typhoon has passed before a final decision is made on Sunday morning.Based on the advice of government authorities and experts, World Rugby and the Japan Rugby 2019 Organising Committee are advising fans in the Tokyo, Yokohama and City of Toyota areas to stay indoors on Saturday, not to travel and to keep monitoring the official Rugby World Cup 2019 digital and social channels, including the RWC 2019 Fan Information Twitter handle @Japan2019_ENG for regular updates.World Rugby Chief Operating Officer and Tournament Director Alan Gilpin said when addressing the media: “This is a complex and dynamic situation which we have been monitoring extremely closely with the assistance of our weather information experts. We are now in a position to accurately predict the likely impact of Typhoon Hagibis on Rugby World Cup fixtures this weekend.“While making every possible effort to put in place a contingency plan that would enable all of Saturday’s matches to be played, it would be grossly irresponsible to leave teams, fans, volunteers and other tournament personnel exposed during what is predicted to be a severe typhoon.“As a result, we have taken the decision to cancel some matches in order to ensure the safety of all involved. It is the right thing to do, and comes with the support of all stakeholders, including the teams.“We fully appreciate that England, France, New Zealand and Italy fans will be disappointed, but we trust they will appreciate that their safety must come first. They will be entitled to a full refund on their match tickets.“Our message for all fans in Japan for Rugby World Cup is to heed all official advice, stay indoors throughout Saturday and do not attempt to travel on the day.”Alan Gilpin has been asked about the Scotland match, which is slated for Sunday and has not yet been cancelled, with Gilpin saying RWC would make a decision about the game on Sunday morning after reviewing weather conditions.The reporter asks if conditions mean it can’t be played on Sunday, whether RWC might consider moving the match to a different venue, or delaying to a difference day, given the significance of the match and the fact it is effectively a knockout match for Scotland,Gilpin says they have been striving for consistency with their contingency policy.“Italy are in exactly the same position Scotland are in,” says Gilpin. He says that while Scotland v Japan is a “huge match” and they’d obviously love it to go ahead “We won’t be treating that match, if it can’t be played, any differently.”Alan Gilpin has been asked if Rugby World Cup has any regrets in light of these cancellations.“No regrets at all,” he says. “I think what you’ve all seen over the last three weeks, absolutely in all respects vindicates the decision to hold the tournament here in Japan.“It’s rare for a typhoon of this magnitude to cause these impacts this late in the typhoon season.“We’ve made the right decision.”Scotland’s World Cup is still in doubt after tournament organisers said on Thursday they would wait until Sunday morning to decide if the Scots’ final and decisive pool match against Japan would go ahead that evening, as large parts of the country await the arrival of one of the most powerful typhoons in decades.England and France, however, will not play in Yokohama on Saturday evening, with World Rugby and tournament organisers taking the unprecedented step of cancelling their match. Both teams have qualified for the quarterfinals with a game to spare.Tournament director Alan Gilpin told reporters that “after extensive evaluation of weather information” organisers had decided to take the unprecedented step of cancelling matches between New Zealand and Italy and England v France.The matches will be treated as a 0-0 draws and each time awarded two points.“We’ve taken the very difficult but we think right decision to cancel matches,” Gilpin said, adding that Australia v Georgia and Ireland v Ireland Samoa would go ahead. “The decision to cancel these matches has not been taken lightly and had been taken with the safety of players, supporters, and volunteers’ safety as a priority,” Gilpin said.He said the risks were “too challenging” to deliver a fair and consistent approach for all teams and ensure the safety of spectators. Fans with tickets for the two cancelled matches will receive a refund.Gilpin says that RWC is issuing advice to all rubgby fans in the Tokyo and Yokohama areas “to stay indoors, not to travel and to monitor Rugby World Cup through digital and social channels”.Alan Gilpin is running through a list of the matches from this weekend and the impact the typhoon will have on them:Australia v Georgia will go ahead.Ireland v Samoa will go ahead.New Zealand v Italy will be cancelled.England v France will be cancelled.Unless I missed it, he did not say what will happen with the Japan v Scotland game.Alan Gilpin, head of the Rugby World Cup, is speaking now.He says they are “Confirming adjustments to match schedule” as a result of the predicted impact of Hagibis.Which includes “regrettably the decision to cancel matches on safety grounds”.Officials are arriving and taking their seats on the podium. Cue the mad shuttering of cameras. What is a super typhoon?\u0026nbspIn a word, intense. Hagibis earned super status – the most severe category – after winds passed the 150mph threshold, peaking at 180mph. It is far larger than Typhoon Faxai which – on the day of England’s arrival for the World Cup – brought Tokyo to a standstill, killing three people and leaving a million homes without power. Hagibis is weakening, but its power remains destructive.How did it grow so fierce?\u0026nbspUS Navy meteorologist Robert Speta told the Japan Times the storm had gone through an \u0027explosive intensification in a matter of hours\u0027, adding: \u0027In fact it was an historic amount of intensification in such a short time. This only happens when all the right ingredients are in place. Like if you had a fire and instead of throwing gasoline on it to make it bigger you also grabbed some lighter fluid, a bit of oil and a couple of aerosol cans for good measure.\u0027What are those ingredients?\u0026nbspWarm sea temperature, high humidity, Coriolis force, low wind shear and atmospheric instability.\u0026nbspWhich games are affected?\u0026nbspBesides the Pool C decider in Yokohama on Saturday, Scotland’s match with Japan at the same venue 24 hours later. Ireland’s Pool A game against Samoa on Saturday and Wales’s Pool\u0026nbspD match with Uruguay on Sunday are on the other side of Japan, so likely out of the storm’s main path. But the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka could be affected.Ooh, we have someone speaking. They’re just issuing housekeeping notices – about translation, asking people to raise their hands, identify themselves and to speak slowly for translators.We have a livestream of the press conference (which is also embedded at the top of this blog), though as you will see, nothing is happening and we are waiting for officials, including Mick Wright, Alan Gilpin, Akira Shimasu, and Koji Horluchi to arrive.Our rugby union correspondent Rob Kitson is there and says: “There’s plenty of interest from all over the world, as you would expect. Clearly it is an extreme weather situation but World Rugby is under a bit of pressure to clarify a number of issues, not least precisely how many games the organisers are still looking to reschedule. If Scotland v Japan does not happen for any reason there will be a major row England, meanwhile, are understood to be relocating to a new base away from Tokyo today to avoid the approaching typhoon.”Our rugby union correspondent Gerard Meagher explains what is going on and what it might mean for the tournament:World Rugby may be forced into taking the unprecedented step of cancelling Saturday’s Pool C match between England and France as well as Scotland’s crucial fixture with Japan 24 hours later as the category five super typhoon heads for Yokohama. Both matches were among the most in-demand when tickets went on sale.Any games cancelled due to weather problems are registered as scoreless draws, with both sides awarded two points. While England and France have already qualified for the quarter-finals, it could have huge consequences for Scotland’s Pool A game with the hosts, which also takes place at Yokohama’s 72,000-seater stadium. If that match is cancelled Scotland would be eliminated, assuming Ireland beat Samoa on Saturday.One of World Rugby’s contingency plans is to move both matches to other venues but that would cause havoc for more than 140,000 supporters across the weekend and prove a huge logistical headache for tournament organisers.Hello and welcome to the ’s live coverage of today’s Rugby World Cup weather-related drama.World Rugby is set to hold a press conference, announcing a decision on whether Super Typhoon Hagibis will prompt some of this weekend’s matches to be cancelled or moved.Japan is awaiting updates on the progress of one of the most violent super typhoons in recent history, which, if it makes landfall in Japan as it is predicted to on Saturday, could cause huge damage and potential casualties.Rugby fans are watching the progress of the typhoon carefully, for its impact on the World Cup. Two crucial matches face cancellation or disruptive last-minute shifts to new venue due to Hagibis.Scotland are scheduled to play Japan at the 72,000-seater Yokohama Stadium on Sunday, and England are scheduled to play France at the same venue on Saturday. Both matches were among the most in-demand when tickets went on sale.The stakes are highest for the Scots, who would be eliminated if their match against Japan were to be cancelled, assuming that Ireland beat Samoa in Fukuoka on Saturday. World Rugby and World Cup organisers are due to hold a press conference at noon local time on Thursday (4am BST, 2pm AEDT). Our Japan correspondent Justin McCurry is on the ground at the press conference, to bring us news from it. Our stellar Rugby World Cup team is also on hand to provide analysis of and reaction to whatever announcement is made today. Thanks for following along.

They gnash their terrible teeth. Pound their feet. The company bringing to life my novel The Panopticon are pushing themselves as hard as they can towards a point of no return. Anna Russell-Martin is playing the lead role of Anais Hendricks, a 15-year-old counterculture outlaw and young offender who has just been accused of a violent crime and placed in the Panopticon. She shoves a circle of actors surrounding her, clears a space for herself and drops to the floor in tears – fierce and sudden. She makes a sound that could be wolfish, it holds rage, strength, frustration. I know that sound. I know how affecting this world can be.This is a story I never wanted to tell about a system I did not choose to be raised in. I walked into more than 30 different placements with strangers before the age of 16. I had four legal names. I lived in every single area of the care system. I was a runaway from the age of 12. I’d had strangers telling me who I was for as long as I could remember. My sense of identity as a kid was so fragmented. I wrote poetry daily from the age of seven, for no other reason than I had to and I didn’t see why I shouldn’t. I was too sensitive by far, but I was also pissed off. I did not see why I should have to accept what was expected from me as a child who had always been in the care system.Some people have positive experiences of care and I am always relieved to hear of them. But I did 18 years in the system and that is not how it was for me. My case was extreme even by care standards. Kids at school took bets on whether I’d make it to 16. I wasn’t sure anyone even vaguely understood me.In the process of passing The Panopticon over to this company, I sit for days on end answering questions about the care system. I hate talking about it but it is necessary. The actors are unsure if they can own this material. I tell them they have to. Finding what ties them to their character will help to humanise a demographic that is almost always discussed as a collective. Children from care are iniduals. Just kids. Each brings their own unique self. Their own quirks, strengths, beauty.Theatre is a medium that can make real, raw human experience as stark as it can be. It also holds magic – even on an empty set. I love that. The challenges are many, not least emotionally. I met with the director, Debbie Hannan, many times before we got to the point of rehearsals. We spent a long evening having dinner at my flat, I told her about my upbringing and why I have rarely spoken about it directly. We were able to meet each other as artists and women – people first, storytellers second. It was important. Once we had the measure of what The Panopticon meant to each of us, a foundation of trust was ready to build on.In early discussions with Jackie Wylie (artistic director at the National Theatre of Scotland) and Fiona Mackinnon (associate director of The Panopticon), we discussed how to bring Anais’s huge imagination into a visual medium. I watched a play years ago that had animation throughout the set and it was stunning. They had seen it too. Working with a video designer (Lewis Den Hertog) and an animator (Cat Bruce) clicked as the right approach. We are building the world in layers. It’s so exciting to do.Our set designer, Max Johns, created the cleverest set for this iconic building. A panopticon is a semi-circular institutional building with a watchtower in the middle. The watchtower can see into every cell, but people in the cells cannot see each other, they can only see the watchtower. In that way they feel they are being observed all the time, even if they are not. It was designed by Jeremy Bentham in the 18th century as an experiment in social warehousing and was originally used for prisons, or mental health facilities. It is interesting for me to have watched society become a panopticon. Thanks to social media and CCTV, everyone is living in a system in which we are constantly observing and being observed. We send in our own notes to the watchtower all the time, but we still can’t see into it. The building is a visual representation of Anais’s entire experience of care.When we had our first meeting, Max unpacked a tiny version of the set from a box. It was complete with artwork on the walls, and characters to move around. On stage, it will be an imposing four metres tall, made up of nine triangles, each with two levels. I was captivated. Right there was a tiny world that had come out of my head, out of my childhood, out of a novel, into a play.• The Panopticon is at the Traverse theatre, Edinburgh, until 19 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caaa51f58e3153abb609bb04bf4cfb5c9b22ec7d/0_0_4089_2453/master/4089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c123cad3798b231ec09551921c7c729","title":"children interested in gambling and alcohol facebook","story":"Exclusive: algorithm may expose thousands of under-18s to harmful targeted advertsFacebook has marked hundreds of thousands of children as “interested in” adverts about gambling and alcohol, a joint investigation by the  and the Danish Broadcasting Corporation has found.The social network’s advertising tools reveal 740,000 children under the age of 18 are flagged as being interested in gambling, including 130,000 in the UK. Some 940,000 minors – 150,000 of whom are British – are flagged as being interested in alcoholic beverages.These “interests” are automatically generated by Facebook, based on what it has learned about a user by monitoring their activity on the social network. Advertisers can then use them to specifically target messages to subgroups who have been flagged as interested in the topic.In a statement, Facebook said: “We don’t allow ads that promote the sale of alcohol or gambling to minors on Facebook and we enforce against this activity when we find it. We also work closely with regulators to provide guidance for marketers to help them reach their audiences effectively and responsibly.”The company does allow advertisers to specifically target messages to children based on their interest in alcohol or gambling. A Facebook insider gave the example of an anti-gambling service that may want to reach out to children who potentially have a gambling problem and offer them help and support.But advertisers can target the interests for other purposes as well. The developers of an exploitative video game with profitable “loot box” mechanics, for instance, could target their adverts to children with an interest in gambling without breaching any of Facebook’s regulations.The presence of automated interests also means that alcohol and gambling advertisers who do try to avoid Facebook’s rules about advertising to children have an audience already selected for them by the social network. Facebook relies primarily on automated review for flagging adverts that break its policies. But the automated review is not guaranteed to find breaches before the adverts start to run. Facebook recently settled a lawsuit with the financial expert Martin Lewis over the company’s long-term failure to keep his image out of scam adverts.Facebook’s automatic categorisation of users has been criticised before. In May 2018, the social network was found to be targeting users it thought were interested in subjects such as homosexuality, Islam or liberalism, despite religion, sexuality and political beliefs being explicitly marked out as “sensitive information” by the EU’s GDPR data protection laws.A month later, the  and DBC discovered that the social network had algorithmically labelled 65,000 Russians as “interested in treason”, potentially putting them at risk from the repressive state. Facebook removed that label following inquiries from the .Facebook’s desire to offer as much information as possible to advertisers for their targeting of consumers has repeatedly led to issues regarding advertisers’ ability to misuse that targeting data in ways that are often borderline, or outright illegal. In March, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development charged Facebook with violating the Fair Housing Act, arguing that the site’s targeting features allowed advertisers to restrict housing adverts in a way that “unlawfully discriminates based on race, colour, national origin, religion, familial status, sex, and disability”. Facebook said at the time that it would work with the department and civil rights groups to improve its ad-targeting systems."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25abce4cdfd84799f4b9e30db3106f8105d656dc/0_142_4626_2776/master/4626.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=619298e63916696e06425700dcf4fbc0","title":"send tip winter festival europe win 200 pounds hotel voucher","story":"Spectacular light shows, parades, fireworks, food and drink bacchanals, art shows, carnivals … tell us about the best winter event you’ve experienced on your travelsAs the clocks go back and evening skies darken, outdoor events take on a special atmosphere, whether they are on city streets, up mountains or in forests.

Swap the road for the rails, as Nick Inman provides some of the best train trips in the UK and mainland EuropeRail’s sustainability credentials mean it’s a no-brainer to swap the stress of the airport and traffic jams for the more scenic and greener option. With Europe’s extensive rail network ready to take you directly from city centre to city centre or guide you through some of the best scenery on offer, forget flying or driving, hop on the train. You could stay in Britain and explore unfamiliar parts of the country you don’t normally get to see, or you could take the Eurostar from London to mainland Europe and connect with an international system of high-speed trains and quaint branch lines.Rail is convenient, competitively priced and environmentally friendly. It’s also a reminder that travel is as much about the journey as the destination. It allows you to slow down and think.What are you waiting for?Here are five routes – two at home, three abroad – to get you started. All can be booked through Trainline’s app or website.Glasgow to Mallaig via Fort WilliamIf you want to get kids used to travelling by train, take them north to see the magnificent curving viaduct of Glenfinnan, which is used to carry the Hogwarts Express in the Harry Potter films. The West Highland line is regularly described as one of the most scenic in the British Isles, if not the world (beating even the Trans-Siberian), being a procession of mouthwatering lochs, moors and mountains. From Mallaig you can take ferries to several of the islands of the Inner Hebrides.Getting to Glasgow: you have a choice of trains from London (or other mainline stations in Britain).Typical journey time: Glasgow to Mallaig, 5 hours 16 minutes direct.Nice (Provence, France) to Pisa (Tuscany, Italy)Steep wooded hills tumble into the sea all along the beautiful coast of Liguria from the French border near Ventimiglia to the ancient port city of Genoa and beyond. This trip makes a relaxing way to get to Tuscany along the Riviera. If you are tempted to break up the journey, you may want to visit the resorts of San Remo or Portofino, or one of the dramatically sited and colourful towns of the Cinque Terre.Getting to Nice: take the Eurostar and change at Paris Gare du NordParis Gare de Lyon.Typical journey time: 6 hours 30 minutes, with one or two changes at Ventimiglia andor Genova.Vienna to Klagenfurt via the Semmering PassThis trans-Alpine line was built in 1854 to link the capital of imperial Austria with the Mediterranean. It was a huge engineering achievement and set the standard for mountain railways, for which it has been declared a world heritage site. Take a seat on the left side of the train by preference. The views are superb as you cross the 895-metre (2,900 ft) Semmering Pass, the highlight of the journey. You can extend your trip via Villach to reach Venice: travelling from central to southern Europe in one exhilarating journey.To get to Vienna: take the Eurostar and change at Brussels and Frankfurt.Typical journey time: Vienna to Klagenfurt, 3 hours 55 minutes direct.Leeds to Carlisle via SettleIt has been described as the line that should never have been built, being a technical challenge that was financially ruinous and costly in the lives of navvies. When it was threatened with closure in the 1980s, the Settle-Carlisle line was rediscovered by train lovers, day-trippers and hill walkers and given a second life. Leaving industrial West Yorkshire, climb into the Yorkshire Dales national park via the Ribblehead viaduct to reach the highest mainline station in England, Dent, at an altitude of 350 metres (1,150 ft). Great views of the austere Pennines are guaranteed.Getting to Leeds: there are plenty of high-speed mainline trains from London.Typical journey time: Leeds to Carlisle, 2 hours 40 minutes direct.Cologne to MainzFancy a river cruise through the Rhine Gorge – only, by train? There are railway lines on both banks of the river, giving splendid views of the gorge, which stretches for 40 miles between Koblenz and Bingen. The east bank line is more scenic, but not as well-serviced as the western side, which has a wider choice of trains – so take the west-bank mainline through Bonn. Or, if you don’t mind taking a slightly more circuitous route, you could go down one and back up the other. Either way, en route are innumerable magnificent castles – whether real, mock or ruined – and pretty villages with half-timbered houses.To get to Cologne: take the Eurostar from London St Pancras and change at Brussels.Typical journey time: Cologne to Mainz, 1 hour 40 minutes.Journey times and ticket prices vary according to which particular options you choose.Ticket to rideIt is easy to book the train for your next adventure.

Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s far-right president, is a longstanding critic of Venezuela’s embattled leader, Nicolás Maduro, and has close relations with rightwing Venezuelan groups seeking his overthrow.Earlier this week, Bolsonaro dismissed speculation that the spill had been released by a sinking ship. “If it was a shipwreck, oil would still be coming up. It is more probable that something was dumped there criminally,” he told reporters.Bolsonaro said he did not want to blame another country without proof, but hinted darkly: “We have a country on our radar screen that could be the origin of the oil.”Petrobras’s chief executive, Roberto Castello, said on Tuesday that the amount of oil spilled so far – approximately 500 barrels – was far too much to have been from the result of a routine tank cleaning.Social media users have shared shocking images of the spill, showing kilometers of white sand stained with oil blotches and dead, oil-covered turtles and dolphins. One video shows thick black oil lapping up against a rocky jetty.The oil’s appearance came shortly after Brazil became the focus of international criticism over record wildfires and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest – both of which have surged since Bolsonaro came to office.Environmentalists and indigenous leaders say that Bolsonaro’s stripping back of environmental legislation and protections has stoked a fresh assault on the country’s ecosystems.“The oil spill that’s reached over 132 beaches in the north-east is criminal. Removing the residue from the ocean can take 10 to 20 years,” said the former environment minister Marina Silva in a tweet. “This is a warning that we need to strengthen and not suffocate the environmental monitoring institutions in the country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8634f83acc9955ce00e44528dfdaa101e28b4f40/0_127_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=130f5db285a546aa8382fa5981d1cb7f","title":"ecuador strike lenin moreno latest","story":"Protesters clash with riot police in worst political unrest for decade as thousands call for repeal of austerity measuresIndigenous protesters have clashed again with riot police in Ecuador’s captial as thousands of people joined anti-government rallies and marches calling for the repeal of austerity measures which have sparked the worst political unrest in a decade.Hooded youths threw stones and burned tires as police fired tear gas around the empty parliament building which had been sealed off. Demonstrators also tried unsuccessfully to storm barricades around the presidential palace, which the president, Lenín Moreno, left on Monday, moving his government to the port city of Guayaquil.Other groups including labour unions and indigenous federations marched, for the most part peacefully, on the first day of a national strike which leaders say will not end until the government repeals a decree scrapping fuel subsidies which caused the price of petrol to spike by a third and the cost of diesel to more than double.Moreno’s government lifted the petrol and diesel subsidies last Tuesday as part of a $4.2bn loan deal with the International Monetary Fund reached last year that hinges on belt-tightening reforms. According to the government the payments had cost the country close to $1.4bn (£1.1bn) annually, according to official sources.Outside Quito’s parliament building, thousands of indigenous Ecuadoreans camped out on the grass, many of them carrying sticks. Through loudspeakers, leaders of different indigenous groups addressed the crowd.“What the government has done is reward the big banks, the capitalists, and punish poor Ecuadorians,” said Mesías Tatamuez, head of the Workers’ United Front umbrella union.Indigenous protests have played a central role in toppling a string of Ecuador’s presidents, including Abdalá Bucaram in 1997, Jamil Mahuad in 2000 and Lucio Gutiérrez in 2005.Jaime Vargas, the leader of the Ecuador’s indigenous confederation Conaie, said there would be no dialogue until the government rolled back its order ending the subsidies.“If it is repealed the people will then decide if we will talk or not, but we are angry because we have several injured, several detained and several dead, and this will not stand.”Across the country, two people have died in the unrest, dozens more have been injured and more than 570 have been detained, according to official sources.One demonstrator who wanted to remain anonymous said she had been among more than 100 protesters held by police in the basement of the parliament after a foiled attempt by protesters to take over the building on Monday.“They treated us badly, they insulted us. There are children and young people who are suffering terribly, young people who are being subjugated,” she said.Amnesty International called on the Ecuadorean government to end to “the heavy-handed repression of demonstrations, including mass detentions”.“The state of emergency cannot be an excuse to violently repress people’s discontent over economic measures that may put their rights at risk,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.Ecuador’s defence minister, Oswaldo Jarrín, said the army was seeking to “restore, order, peace and tranquility” on Wednesday as widespread protests took place across the country.Moreno, 66, has accused political opponents of orchestrating an attempted coup and claimed associates of his predecessor Rafael Correa – a former ally turned bitter enemy – were infiltrating the protests and stoking unrest.“They are sectors who are taking advantage of the situation to generate an atmosphere of chaos in Ecuador, very different behaviour from a country which has seen other social protests,” María Paula Romo, the interior minister, said on Wednesday.Correa, who governed Ecuador for a decade, has brushed off the claim he was behind the protest but called for Moreno to step down and for new elections in which he might consider being a candidate.Protest leader Lourdes Tibán, a former parliamentarian, said the violence had been caused by “infiltrators who want to show that the indigenous activists are criminals and thieves who causes damage – but that’s not true”.She said the vast majority of protesters were marching because the fuel price hike had inflated food and transport prices and the indigenous people were the hardest hit.“Rafael Correa does not have the moral authority to praise this protest when he criminalised social protest for us,” she said.Street vendor Carmen Jaque, 50, who had marched to the capital from the Andean province of Chimborazo, said: “We, the people, are marching here, not infiltrators. We’re the ones feeling the price rises.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6431a16d8f68070bd35888200036db05a95296b/161_0_5850_3512/master/5850.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32bd49e0f890cbf594a43587ed554ebf","title":"erdogans syrian incursion could be his biggest gamble yet","story":"Turkey’s president faces some difficult choices after being given green light by the USFor Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, it’s a case of be careful what you wish for. By most accounts, Turkey’s president bamboozled Donald Trump into giving a green light for an invasion of north-east Syria.Yet now, having got what he wanted, Erdoğan faces some difficult choices. How far to go? Who is the enemy? And how long can such a big operation be sustained? It may be the biggest gamble yet by a politician known for taking risks.Worried about biting off more than they can chew, Turkey’s representatives are busily redefining and repurposing the military incursion, which began with a series of air strikes on Wednesday. What Erdoğan has for months described as an essential move to eliminate a Kurdish terrorist threat has suddenly been transformed into a “peace operation” primarily targeting Islamic State.It’s plain this abrupt change of tack was influenced by the uproar in Washington that followed Trump’s decision. Even normally sycophantic Republicans accused the White House of betraying Kurdish-led forces that hitherto spearheaded the anti-Isis fight. It’s possible Trump gave Erdoğan the go-ahead in order to distract attention from the impeachment inquiry. If so, his ruse backfired.Turkey has also changed its tune about long-term territorial ambitions in Syria, notwithstanding Erdoğan’s stated intention to create a quasi-permanent “safe zone” potentially 20 miles deep and 300 miles long (32km and 483km). “Turkey has no interest in occupying any part of Syria,” said Kalın, characterising previous cross-border operations in Jarablus and Afrin as mere temporary landgrabs.Fahrettin Altun, Erdoğan’s director of communications, meanwhile offered assurances that humanitarian considerations were uppermost. “The plan helps Turkey shelter innocent people,” he wrote in the Washington Post. Up to 2 million Syrian refugees now in Turkey would “volunteer” to live in the safe zone, he added – even though most do not have a prior connection with the area.Kalın also claimed a mass repatriation would take place voluntarily, not under duress, although nobody seems to have asked the people concerned and aid agencies are highly sceptical.As he prepares to send in the troops, Erdoğan face multiple unknowns. One is whether Turkey has the capacity, let alone the will, to lead the charge against Isis or take control of the detention and refugee camps presently guarded by the Kurds. Ankara is already being blamed in some quarters for jeopardising the fight against Isis.Like everybody else, Erdoğan has no idea which way Trump may jump next. Similar doubts apply to Russia, which is reportedly supportive but recently clashed with Turkey over operations in Idlib, and to Bashar al-Assad’s Iranian-backed regime in Damascus, which may use the confusion to recapture territory and insert its own forces.It’s unclear what the Turkish public, already disillusioned with Erdoğan and beset by deepening economic woes, will make of a costly, open-ended conflict that will look to many like an unnecessary war of choice. And if the dire humanitarian consequences predicted by the UN come to pass, Erdoğan surely knows he will bear the blame internationally – and face possible US and EU sanctions.For all these reasons, Erdoğan will probably tread cautiously at first. He may use Turkish-backed militia fighters from Syria’s rebel National Army, supported from the air, rather than regular Turkish troops in any initial deployment. Reports on Wednesday said the rebels were moving into position. US officials predict there will be no large-scale invasion and any first advance may be limited to establishing combat posts inside Syria.Only now fully aware, perhaps, of the dangers – personal, political and military – of his high-risk Syria gamble, Erdoğan can be expected to use a White House meeting with Trump on 13 November to try to shore up US support, possibly before making any definitive move. Yet what happens next may be beyond his control. Kurdish leaders insist there will be no retreat. If the Turks come, they say, they will take the fight to them."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4045590.1570660816!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us heron family bird blown to kerry by storm lorenzo","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeast Bittern:  bird only lived for 30 minutes after it landed from America in John O’Donoghue’s back garden near Tralee. Photograph:  Domnick Walsh A rarity of a small American bird being swept across the Atlantic by Storm Lorenzo before being discovered in a Co Kerry garden will be the envy of European birdwatchers for years to come, say experts.The unexpected arrival on Irish shores of the Least Bittern earlier this week was tinged with sadness, however, when the bird died of exhaustion shortly afterwards.Lorenzo delivered several US-based birds to Irish shores, but none as rare as the Bittern. It is only the 10th time one has been found on this side of the Atlantic.The bird – a member of the heron family – was found in John O’Donoghue’s back garden near Tralee on Monday night. Unable to identify it, his neighbour, Anthony O’Connor, sent a photograph to Birdwatch Ireland.“They really struck gold with this,” explained ornithologist Brian Burke, who differentiated it from the similar European Little Bittern with the help of rare bird expert Niall Keogh. Find of a lifetimeUnsure at first, the experts requested follow-up pictures of the wing – which confirmed their suspicions and the find of a lifetime in the bird-watching world.“At this time of the year you would get some American birds blown over,” explained Mr Burke. “They are usually migrating from the northern part of America to the southern part of America and something goes wrong when they are trying to navigate.”In recent days, other confirmed sightings in Ireland have included a Baltimore Oriole, a Black and White Warbler, a Common Nighthawk and a handful of Red-Eyed Vireos. Rerouted speciesBut the Least Bittern is an exception – a holy grail of hardcore birdwatchers who travel to western Irish islands every year in the hope of spotting rerouted American species.“It would have flown over on its own. The journey was way too long for it,” said Mr Burke. “When birds migrate, they burn off fat reserves. It would have run out so it would have then burned off muscle. It was never going to recover.”It was placed in one of the men’s freezers to await collection by the Natural History Museum. While it has no monetary value, it is of considerable scientific merit and will be available to international researchers. “There are lifelong birdwatchers who will never find a bird as rare in Ireland,” said Mr Burke.

Photograph by Cyril Byrne Majority State-owned AIB is preparing to offload thousands of distressed mortgages secured on family homes, a politically contentious step which the bank has avoided until now.The lender has sold billions of euro in non-performing debt in recent years, but it has all been secured on second homes or business debt. The loan sale, which has been code-named Project Birch, is being planned for early next year, likely before the end of spring.It is likely to reignite debate about the sale of non-performing loans to so-called vulture funds. Many of the borrowers earmarked for inclusion in Project Birch have paid little or nothing towards their debts for long periods of time. Meanwhile, the bank is under pressure from the European Central Bank to bring down its record level of non-performing loans. Debtor advocates and Opposition politicians have raised fears over the treatment of borrowers by overseas funds who have invested billions in Irish assets. Others point out that debtors are offered the same protections no matter who owns their loan, and argue that the fears around investment funds are overblown. Both Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB have sold owner-occupier loans to investment funds this year.AIB – which is 71 per cent owned by the taxpayer – has targeted reducing its level of non-performing loans to about 5 per cent by the end of the year, down from its current level of 7.5 per cent. The exact size of the Project Birch portfolio will be influenced by another process, already under way. AIB is currently engaged with two charitable organisations that are bidding to take some non-performing family home mortgages from the bank. An organisation called iCare Housing, which is run by debtor rights advocate David Hall and funded by UK debt investor Arrow Global, is competing with Home for Life, an Irish entity backed by financier Arizun and another UK investor, LCM Partners, to buy the loans.Indicative bidsWhile it is not clear exactly how many loans are likely to be sold to the charitable investors, it is understood that indicative bids were received in recent days from the two organisations. The charitable groups are likely to bid at a significantly lower level than an investment fund, as they have ruled out aggressive strategies such as home repossession, which would allow them to maximise the value from the portfolio. This will limit the bank’s ability to sell a significant number of loans to the charities, leaving the remainder likely to face inclusion in Project Birch. Three sources agreed that thousands of loans were being considered for inclusion in the larger loan sale process next year.A spokesman for AIB said: “We remain focused on reducing non-performing exposures to more normalised levels. Supporting customers in difficulty remains a key priority for AIB, and whilst we do see loan sales as part of our overall plan, our key priority remains restructuring customers on a case-by-case basis.”"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit a day in the life of an irish border crossing","story":"Ambrose “Bo” McGurgan is checking the tyres on his six-axle lorry at the Applegreen truck stop near Castlebellingham, Co Louth, south of the Irish Border. It is the only check he will undergo before crossing over into Northern Ireland.From the end of this month all that could change with the UK’s exit from the EU on October 31st, the date British prime minister Boris Johnson wants Brexit to happen.McGurgan fears the return of the dreaded customs checks of more than a quarter century ago. He remembers the hard border when 300 or 400 trucks could be parked up for hours awaiting customs clearance.“It will be going back to square one, like in the 70s. It would be a disaster. You could be sitting all day in Dundalk waiting to get cleared,” he tells The .It is 11am on a Monday and the Armagh man has been working for six hours and has already lifted and “tipped” a trailer in Dublin and is heading across the Border for another delivery in Newtownards, Co Down.He is hauling a mixed load of food and industrial goods – sauces and engineering bolts – but requires no paperwork as he drives, unhindered, across an open border between two jurisdictions currently within the EU. A return to the border of the past, that McGurgan waited hours to cross. is very real again.Johnson’s government proposed to the EU last week to replace the contentious backstop guarantee to avoid a hard Irish border with a plan to impose a new customs border on the island of Ireland.The deluge of paperwork, the queues of lorries, the hours-long delays, the potential targeting of customs officers by people upset with the return of a visible border “would be a disaster,” says McGurgan.“People don’t realise how bad it is going to be. We, the older generation, we have done it all. We know how bad it is. There will be customs men shot. There will be. Everybody is fighting for a loaf,” he said.McGurgan’s truck was one of 6,639 goods vehicles to cross the Border on the A1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast last Monday. This is the busiest crossing on the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Traffic counters operated by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the agency monitoring the State’s roads, show that on average five goods vehicles crossed this point of the Border every minute on Monday.This is where the impact of the UK leaving without a deal has the potential to cause the most complications.Next to McGurgan’s truck is fellow haulier Brendan McParland, also a veteran Border-crosser. He is heading to Dungannon, Co Tyrone, with a load of peat after dropping plasterboard in Athy, Co Kildare.He usually hauls European steel, landed at Warrenpoint in Co Down, across the Border to Dublin, Kilkenny or Carlow. Normally he can complete two return runs to Dublin in one day from Warrenpoint.“If the Border was to come, you couldn’t guarantee you would even get one load done,” he said, munching on a sandwich in the cab of his lorry.Michael Harbinson is one of several lorry drivers stopped at Applegreen transporting Coca-Cola products from its manufacturing facility in Knockmore Hill outside Belfast to customers in the Republic.He believes an all-island economic unit is the way to avoid a hard Border. Not everyone wants this when it comes to both customs and EU single market rules north and south. The DUP also wants Northern Ireland to be able to vote to opt in to an all-island zone covering EU single market rules for goods every four years.“If the North takes a deal still tied with the South, it is the best of both worlds. It is the DUP who is ruining it. They just stand firm in their stance,” said Harbinson.At the last junction before the southern M1-N1 crosses the Border and turns into the northern A1 there is a fuel service station. It lies between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.Colin Byrne, one of the pump attendants of the junction 20 service station, has no clue how the UK and EU would manage this Border if Britain leaves without a deal.“That’s the six million dollar question. Sure how many back roads are there across the Border. It is not doable, simply not doable,” he said.Johnson has ruled out customs checks at or near the Border but has not specified in his plan where “designated locations” for some required checks might be. Byrne offers a foretaste of how checks might work: “every once in a while,” he says, the Garda and customs check vehicles at the southbound exit 18 off the M1 into Dundalk. “If you saw the mayhem that that causes,” he said.On the bridge over the A1 dual-carriageway next to the Carrickdale Hotel there is a constant drone of noise as an “artic” or smaller “rigid” lorry or a light goods vehicle is always coming or going.This is the north-south White Van Man highway.Between 5am and 7pm last Monday – the busiest period of the day – 5,722 goods vehicles cross the Border. That is one goods vehicle every eight seconds. This traffic is split 50:50 in either direction.“It shows trade is equally balanced going in either direction,” said Séamus Leheny, policy manager of the Freight Transport Association, speaking loudly to be heard over the hum of traffic on the bridge.“It is the artery of trade on the island of Ireland. It connects the two largest cities and to have any type of barrier on this, or ersions, or checks, it would inhabit trade and growth economically on either side of the Border here.”Interrupting the flow of traffic here would have a huge impact, he says lorries would “soon stack up” and could be waiting hours if they had to have paperwork inspected or their load physically inspected.The stakes on finding a fix to the Brexit-Border conundrum are high. Leheny explains that five times as much freight crosses the Irish Border than moves between Northern Ireland and Britain, the North’s biggest market, but it is lower in value because it is mostly ingredients and components, and not completed products.“What we make in Northern Ireland, it is comprised of bits and pieces sourced from every corner of the island of Ireland. If we have a hard border, the existence of those products that we make in Northern Ireland are jeopardised because you would have delays, tariffs and the sanitary controls as well,” he said.In the retail game, this Border crossing is an essential supply chain route for multinationals. Northern Ireland supermarkets are stocked from distribution centres in the Republic, and vice versa. Then there are the food products made with ingredients coming from both north and south of the Border.Aodhán Michael Connolly, director of Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, says that a supermarket chicken salad sandwich can have ingredients involving six border movements (north-south and east-west, between the North and Britain), while “the humble cottage pie” can have eight, including a cheese topping produced and processed on different sides of the Border. Each movement involves tariffs so the overall costs could be huge.“That border crossing isn’t just to move goods A to B. It is a lifeline to the supply chain and to those small and medium-sized enterprises right down to the farmers who are in our supply chain,” he said. “If there isn’t frictionless movement across that border, each of those costs will have to go down the supply chain and it is going to make things tougher for the Northern Ireland consumer.”Connolly sees Johnson’s plan as “unworkable” if it is the final deal because a customs border would amount to a hard border, but it is “progress” to open negotiations because it includes an all-island zone for goods.Driving one of his nine trucks across the Border on the A1, Declan Trainor, a cattle and goods haulier, believes the island of Ireland should be “treated as a whole and as one island”.He has no idea how the Border, just a few hundred metres from his office at Carrickcarnan, will look on November 1st, or how he will be able to continue transporting tiles from mainland Europe to Northern Ireland.“It is the unknown. That is the scary part. The Government hasn’t really said how to prepare for it. They are only guessing themselves now so how are you supposed to prepare?” he said. “You don’t know whether it is a dance you are going to or a war. Sure how do you dress for it?”Speaking a few days later, Trainor says Johnson’s “two borders for four years” proposal has left him even more confused. It has also made people who rely on free trade and free movement of goods across the Border “desperate,” he said.“Whatever concern we had, we are more concerned now,” he said.How busy is the M1A1\u0026nbspcrossing?The Border crossing on the M1 motorwayA1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast is the busiest thoroughfare along the 499-kilometre open frontier between the Republic and Northern Ireland.The four-lane crossing between Newry and Dundalk is about five times busier than the next busiest crossing over the Blackwater river between Emyvale, Co Monaghan, and Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, based on traffic figures counted daily by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the State agency that manages the Irish road network.The agency uses a system of counters under the surface of strategically important roads across the country that can differentiate vehicles by wheel axle lengths. This allows the agency to gather data and analyse the volume of traffic and type of vehicles passing on the road for every hour of every day.The counter at Junction 20 on the A1 at Ravensdale between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth, showed that Monday, September 30th – a month before the UK’s scheduled exit from the EU – was a typically busy day for traffic for this major transport route on the island of Ireland.Some 25,301 vehicles crossed the Border over the 24-hour period: 18,175 cars, 6,639 goods vehicles (including the heaviest articulated lorries), 318 buses and 24 motorbikes. That means 17 vehicles crossed the Border on average every minute last Monday. One goods vehicle crossed the Border every 12 seconds.Hauliers, traders and businesses along the Border say any kind of delays stopping traffic on this corridor after Brexit would quickly result in heavy congestion and tailbacks.The busiest times of day are during the morning rush-hour between 8am and 9am, when traffic volumes peaked at 1,935 vehicles, and the late afternoon peak between 4pm and 5pm at 1,897 vehicles.The bulk of the traffic crosses the Border between the hours of 7am and 7pm when 19,625 vehicles were counted last Monday, or on average of 1,635 an hour.The traffic is evenly split between northbound and southbound vehicles. However, more than twice as many goods vehicles head southbound between 5am and 9am – making deliveries to the Republic or transporting goods to Dublin Port in time to make the 8am ferry departures to England out of Dublin Port.This route is a critical artery for goods travelling from Northern Ireland south into the Republic. Some 3,425 goods vehicles crossed the Border heading south into the Republic last Monday.This worked out an average of 143 per hour. In other words, one goods vehicle crossed the Border into the Republic on the main Dublin-Belfast road every 25 seconds last Monday.To put this in a national context, this part of the A1 is almost as busy or busier every day than the main Dublin to Galway M4 road at Kinnegad (26,400 vehicles on average a day), the main Dublin to Cork M7 road at Portlaoise (25,700 vehicles) and than the main Dublin to Wexford M11 road at Arklow (22,800 vehicles).Cross-Border workersTen minutes drive south of the Border, dozens of parked cars – nearly all Northern Irish-registered vehicles – line either side of the road off Junction 17 of the M1 near Dundalk in Co Louth.They belong to Northern Irish tradesmen, mostly from across the Border in south Armagh, who park and car-pool into the Republic for work. They are mostly construction works, plumbers and electricians.“There are thousands of people going to and from work every day, crossing the Border every couple of minutes. There are thousands and thousands of guys down south working and Dublin is most of where the work is,” said Neil Byrne, a plumber from Mullaghbane near Forkhill.The Armagh man usually arrives at around 5.50am to park his car and catch his lift to Dublin. He has worked “all over the south” including in Kildare and Athlone.Byrne says he and his fellow commuters to the Republic are concerned about a crash-out Brexit and the return of a hard border resulting in hours and hours of traffic delays crossing the Border.He doesn’t believe a hard border would work it does not make sense to have one, he says. “It is one small country in my opinion: it doesn’t matter whether you are north or south, Ireland is Ireland and you have to get to your work regardless,” he said.Delays and traffic jams are not his only worry.“If there’s a Border, it has the whole issue of the Troubles starting again because in my own personal opinion it is going to happen the exact same way it did back then: customs guys get attacked, then there is a police presence, then they get attacked and then there is a military presence,” he said. “It doesn’t take much to set it off.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Stephanie LecocqIrish Government sources were last night playing down the chances of any breakthrough on Brexit when Taoiseach Leo Varadkar meets British prime minister Boris Johnson in Liverpool on Thursday.While reports from London suggested the meeting could lead to a breakthrough in time for next week’s crunch EU summit in Brussels, several senior Irish sources played down this possibility.The notice of the meeting, the wording of which was agreed between Government Buildings and Downing Street, said only that the talks would be “about the process for securing agreement for a Brexit deal” and not, Irish sources pointed out, about actually securing an agreement on the substance on how the UK leaves the EU. Dublin has repeatedly refused to negotiate directly with the UK on Brexit, insisting that the negotiations can only take place between the British government and the EU taskforce under Michel Barnier.Yesterday, Mr Barnier said it was not currently possible to reach agreement with the UK, and there is little expectation in Brussels that any breakthrough is possible to enable EU leaders to approve a deal at next week’s summit.‘Consent clause’Nonetheless, Mr Varadkar and Mr Johnson are likely to discuss the two main impediments to an agreement – the nature and operation of any “consent clause” which enables a Northern Ireland administration and assembly to have a say on remaining under EU single market rules, and the future customs relationship between the North, the rest of the UK and the EU. Dublin objects to any arrangement that would require customs checks between North and South, but the UK says that any such checks – inevitable if the North leaves the EU customs union with the rest of the UK – can be managed to the point of near-invisibility and irrelevance. Dublin does not so far accept these assurances.On Wednesday in the Dáil, Mr Varadkar stressed the views of the people of Northern Ireland, who voted to remain in the EU. ‘Grave difficulty’“Part of the difficulty at the moment is that it is the position of the UK government that Northern Ireland must leave the EU customs union and be part of the UK customs union no matter what the people of Northern Ireland think,” he said. “That is its position and that creates a grave difficulty for us because we want there to be a deal that respects the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland and the people in this Republic too.”Officials say that Dublin is open to discussing how mechanisms could work to attain the consent of the Northern Ireland institutions, but remains opposed to any veto for the DUP. The official statement said only that the two men would meet “in the North West of England” for talks. It is thought the venue is in the Liverpool area, though no details have yet been released. The meeting will not be open to the media, it is understood.It will be the second meeting between the two leaders in the space of three weeks. They also spoke by telephone earlier this week. However, sources in Dublin remain sceptical that any breakthrough on Brexit is likely before next week’s EU summit.

cyclin D1, cyclin E and CDK2 - which are responsible for hair growth and hair retention, were decreased by PM10-like dust and diesel particulate in a “dose-dependent” manner.Dr Hyuk Chul Kwon, who led the study at the Future Science Research Centre in the Republic of Korea, said: While the link between air pollution and serious diseases such as cancer, COPD and CVD are well-established there is little to no research on the effect of particular matter exposure on the human skin and hair in particular.“Our research explains the mode of action of air pollutants on human follicle dermal papilla cells, showing how the most common air pollutants lead to hair loss.”Recent research in China, the world\u0027s most polluted country, found men in their 20s are going bald sooner than previous generations.Although balding is typically associated with advancing age, an increasing number of millennials in the United States say they are experiencing hair loss.Two-thirds of all men will eventually be affected.Read more | Tips and myths on going baldIn the UK, this means roughly 7.4 million men are losing their hair.Genetic factors remain the most influential known cause of baldness.Sources of PM include the burning of fossil fuels, including petrol, diesel and other solid-fuels such as coal, oil and biomass as well as other industrial activities such as building, mining and the manufacturing of building materials like cement, ceramics and bricks.“While it is difficult to escape ambient pollution, limiting time walking on busy streets, especially during rush hour, should help to reduce exposure,” said Mr Kwon.“If you are exercising outdoors, try to do so in areas that are less polluted and do not spend too much time waiting at traffic hotspots such as traffic lights.”Earlier this year a study published in the European Heart Journal showed that pollution is now killing nearly as many people as smoking in Britain.The data suggested the toll is approaching 64,000 a year, compared to 78,000 deaths caused by tobacco.The new study is being presented at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress in Madrid.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

And after a five-month investigation, she has now caught the alleged culprit an account belonging to her fellow footballer’s wife Rebekah Vardy.She announced the findings of her inquiry on Wednesday morning, prompting a huge reaction. Netflix promised to make a documentary on the saga, while Conservative MPs praised her ability to flush out nuisance leakers.On Wednesday night international trade secretary Liz Truss waded into the debate. She said: There has been a massive fallout between some very influential people figures in our country that has ided the nation.There has been finger-pointing, there has been blame-shifting and there has been denials. But enough about Coleen Rooney and Rebehak Vardy.The MP went on to add what a fantastic British export football was.The stories at the centre of the mystery included such family secrets as Ms Rooney’s trip to Mexico to “make a baby girl”, her plans to resurrect her TV career on Strictly, and even a flood in the basement of their mansion.But in a surprise post, Mrs Rooney told her 1.2 million followers that she had invented the stories in a bid to work out who was sharing stories from her private Instagram account.Rooney, 33, said she came up with an idea, and that she blocked everyone apart from an Instagram page belonging to Ms Vardy from seeing her posts.She added: Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper.And, you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV, and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.“Now I know for certain which accountinidual it\u0027s come from.I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.Each of the stories apparently invented by Mrs Rooney were indeed published by the Sun newspaper. All were swiftly deleted.Ms Vardy then wrote back to Mrs Rooney claiming that “various people have had access” to her account, adding: I\u0027m not being funny but I don\u0027t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?Vardy, who is on holiday in Dubai and pregnant with her fifth child, said she was so upset that Rooney had made the accusation, adding: I\u0027m disgusted that I\u0027m even having to deny this.You should have called me the first time this happened.The Sun refused to reveal on Wednesday whether it had paid money for the fake stories about the Rooneys. Ms Vardy has been interviewed a number of times by the newspaper in recent months, where she “opened up” about violent relationships and alleged abuse she suffered as a child.Ms Rooney’s detective work was met with widespread incredulity online, and was discussed by celebrities and politicians.Gavin Barwell MP, former chief of staff to Theresa May,  said the episode was a “sadly all too rare moment when you can identify a leaker”, while Greg Hands MP jokingly invited Ms Rooney to become a Conservative whip.Ms Vardy, 37, is a former nightclub worker who once dated Luke Foster, a footballer in the lower leagues. He later accused her of dropping him to ”trade up” to Mr Vardy, who was playing in the Premier League.During the Euro 2016 tournament it was reported that Wayne Rooney had “warned” Mr Vardy about his wife’s social media posts. Roy Hodgson was forced to deny the story during a press conference.There were also rumours - denied by Ms Vardy - that she had fallen out with Ms Rooney over the use of VIP seats.A statement from the Sun newspaper said: Each of the stories provided to The Sun was put to Coleen\u0027s representatives before publication, and on each occasion they declined to comment.In her statement, Coleen Rooney said she posted false stories on her social media account in the hope that they would end up in The Sun. Those she claimed to have fabricated include the story about gender selection in Mexico - an article which appeared on page 11 of the paper on Friday, August 16.The following month, The Sun reported that Mrs Rooney was resurrecting her television career by appearing on Strictly Come Dancing. The story appeared on page 19 on Sunday, September 29. In today\u0027s paper - which appears to be the straw that broke the camel\u0027s back - The Sun published a story which again Mrs Rooney said was fake. In its Bizarre showbiz section, the paper reported that the Rooneys\u0027 new £20million mansion had flooded. The Sun\u0026#39s story about the Rooneys\u0026#39 flooded mansionMrs Vardy responded to the tweet with a statement of her own denying she had anything to do with the stories. The Sun has reported on Rooney and Vardy\u0027s exchange and their article states: Each of the stories provided to The Sun was put to Coleen\u0027s representatives before publication, and on each occasion they declined to comment.As is customary in the modern era, a big story like this is easy pickings for the meme-makers and tongue-in-cheek social media accounts.Here is a selection of the funniest:Want the best of The  direct to your email and WhatsApp?

flooding our market and resulting in unsustainable price falls.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks -

You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load. Go to your profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, open Cellular Data Use and choose Use Less Data.411 See your LikesIt’s easy to lose track of your friends’ old posts on Instagram, but if you know you Liked it, you’ll be able to track it down easily.

Take a look at everything you’ve bookmarked by tapping the same icon that sits near the top of your profile.Everyone knows you can expand the reach of your posts by using a number of relevant hashtags, but what those are aren’t always glaringly obvious. You can easily find the right ones for you by typing a keyword into Instagram’s search bar, selecting a hashtag from the list and swiping along the Related row that appears at the top of the screen.611 Clear your search historyWhatever your reasons are, you can clear your recent searches by going to your profile, hitting the three dots in the top right and selecting Clear Search History. To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon.

Go to your profile, tap the three dots, open Two-Factor Authentication and toggle it on.911 Share lots at onceIf you want to upload a bunch of related pictures and videos without flooding everyone else’s feed, you can shared them all as one post. Hit the + icon, select Gallery, choose Select Multiple, pick out up to 10 of the pictures and clips you want, tap Next and reorder them by dragging and dropping.Instagram Stories has been a massive hit since it came out last year, but you might not know that you can record Stories clips without having to hold one of your digits on the record key. On the Stores screen, just swipe through the options at the bottom until you get to Hands-Free. Most people know you can delete any of the images you’ve already posted, but not everyone is aware that you can also edit them.

The trick that Rooney says she used to find out who had been passing on information from her private posts\u0026nbsprelies on a feature specific to Instagram stories, and not found on most other social platforms. When navigating through posts, you are not simply looking at the pictures and videos people shared – they\u0027re also looking at you, looking at their posts.Coleen Rooney accuses Rebekah Vardy of leaking her stories to The SunWhen someone posts an Instagram story, they can see a full list of the accounts that have viewed that story. Since it is not possible to look at stories unless a user is logged in, there is no way to see any post without being logged in.What\u0027s more, those stories can be locked down, ensuring that only specific people can see them. If an account is private – as Rooney says hers was – then someone has to request to follow it that means that only approved people can see stories or feed posts on a private account.Once someone is following an account – whether\u0026nbspit is private or public – people can also be blocked from seeing posts on a story. That means that people must be approved and also not blocked to see a post, which can be used to give very precise\u0026nbspcontrol over who is looking at Instagram stories.Rooney says she used this feature to find out who had been taking information from her posts. She says that she uploaded stories but restricted them so that they could only be seen by one specific account – Vardy\u0027s, she claims – allowing her to know where any information had come from.What\u0027s more, despite the fact that Instagram is unusually transparent about who has been interacting with stories, it importantly does not tell people who else has been viewing a story. That means there is no way to know if you are the only person who has seen a specific post, and therefore no way to know if only you know certain information.In short, there are three particular features of Instagram that make such a claim possible. It allows you to shut down your account so that only approved people can see it it lets you see who viewed your stories\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspyou can block specific people from doing so.When combined, those three settings can be used as a powerful trick to allow people to see information without knowing that only they are seeing it.It is rare that this\u0026nbspwill be used to work out who is passing on personal information to newspapers. But it could expose people in a variety of other, more pedestrian ways – and do so without the person using it even knowing.Similar features do exist on other platforms. Snapchat, which had the stories features before Instagram, also allows people to see who has been looking at their stories, and even when someone screengrabs one LinkedIn informs users when somebody has been looking at their profile.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

With the release of iOS 13 and Android 10, both platforms support system-wide dark mode.Those dark modes turn the phone\u0027s menus, notifications and other parts of the system black.

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  Instagram had been particularly slow among the bigger apps to update to reflect that change. That meant that users could often find themselves hit by the glare of the app after navigating around other apps that had already adopted the darker look.The trick Coleen Rooney used to accuse Rebekah Vardy, explainedThe rollout was confirmed by Instagram boss Adam Mosseri, who reminded users that they need to be on the latest version of their iPhone or Android operating system to be able to use it.Starting today, you can use Instagram in dark mode on iOS 13 or Android 10, he wrote on Twitter.\u0026nbspTurn dark mode on your phone to try it out.As Mr\u0026nbspMosseri\u0027s message suggests, there seems to be no way to turn on the dark mode on a per-app basis, so that it is only switched on for Instagram and not other apps. Instead, it seems to only be able to take its lead from the operating system, and whether dark mode is switched on for the whole phone.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Get Me Out Of Here! star Vardy, following a process of elimination.She wrote: “For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.“There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family – all without my permission or knowledge.“After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.”Rooney, 33, said she “came up with an idea” to try to prove her theory that it was Vardy, and that she blocked everyone apart from her from seeing her Instagram stories.She added: “Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into The Sun newspaper.Hodgson rubbishes rift between Rooney and Vardy over striker’s wife“And, you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV, and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.“It’s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked however, I had to.

Jed Foster, 20, has appeared at Reading Magristrates\u0027 Court where denied any involvement with the murderA fire that broke out at the site of Village Bakery on Coed Aben Road, Wrexham Industrial Estate in Wales“I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.“If you thought this was happening you could have told me \u0026amp I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped. Over the years various people have had access to my insta \u0026amp just this week I found I was following people I didn’t know and have never followed myself.“I’m not being funny but I don’t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?“I liked you a lot Coleen \u0026amp I’m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I’m heavily pregnant. I’m disgusted that I’m even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.”She ended the post with a broken heart emoji.Her spokeswoman has since told The Independent she is consulting with her legal team over the accusation. “Such a shame that Coleen didn’t just call,” she added.The Sun said it was unlikely to comment on any story about its journalists’ sources – but by late morning it appeared to have removed all three stories made up by Rooney from its website.The spat comes after then England manager Roy Hodgson denied rumours of a rift between the two women when their husbands were playing together for the national team in the 2016 European Championships.But if it seemed like a miserable situation for all the main protagonists, there was at least one happy note. A chap going by the name Dave had first suggested Rooney turn detective.In January she had tweeted that she had become aware that someone in her close circle was betraying her to the press.“Make a false story tell ppl different things see which 1 comes out  find the culprit,” wrote Dave.Whether Rooney saw the tweet and followed the advice remains to be confirmed but by mid-afternoon on Wednesday, Dave had taken credit anyway. His own Twitter biography had been changed: “uk football darts #mufc poker player, Detective who recently solved the coleen rooney vs rebekah vardy case.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I couldn’t be an enabler.”Rihanna continued, adding in an apparent reference to the National Football League, which\u0026nbsporganises the championship every year: “There’s things within that organisation that I do not agree with at all, and I was not about to go and be of service to them in any way.”Created with Sketch.The best albums of 2019 (so far) Show all 67Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 467 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.567 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1367 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1467 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1767 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2167 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2767 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2967 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3167 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3667 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4367 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4567 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5967 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6067 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.6167 Pixies – Beneath the EyrieTales of witchy curses (“On Graveyard Hill”) and spirit reincarnation (“Daniel Boone”) feel like they’ve been dug up from ancient folklore, and capture classic-Pixies menace and ghoulish spirit. Over the album’s 12 tracks, ghostly organs and minor-key guitar-picked sequences help to conjure this dark, Gothic vibe. Yet for all its darkness, Beneath the Eyrie is brimming with the kind of melody that we expect from these indie-rock giants from the late Eighties. “Ready for Love” is a melancholy ballad with harmonising vocals from bassist Paz Lenchantin (Kim Deal’s now-permanent replacement), while lead single “Catfish Kate” – a tale of a woman battling a catfish in a river told by Black Jack Hooligan – is a rock hit in waiting. (Elisa Bray)6267 Jenny Hval – The Practice of LoveThis endlessly fascinating artist’s seventh, full-length, album The Practice of Love is just as considered as 2016\u0027s Blood Bitch, examining one’s role in humankind and on Earth, and probing that favourite of pop-song themes: love. But where the 2017 Nordic Music Prize-winning Blood Bitch was packed with visceral imagery and disarming sonics, the themes of The Practice of Love are encased in a warm cocoon of poetry, blissed-out circling synths and trance-like Nineties beats. (Elisa Bray)This is nomy at their most ambitious and pleasurably weird. As with the dreamy “Upset My Girlfriend”, which speaks of a man about to propose to his partner despite the fight they’re in, it’s an album stranded somewhere between pure joy and unexplainable sadness like slapping on a false smile despite feeling miserable, and recognising how much it helps in the moment. (Adam White)Listening on headphones, I was reminded of the late French designer Janet Laverriere. Born in 1909, she was still a powerful, playful force when I interviewed her for this paper in her eighties. She banged a cast iron radiator with a spoon to celebrate the echoes and curves of essential pipework: “I put all the hard plumbing on the outside. In kitchens, in bathrooms, I am feminist, evidemment!”Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Why Me? Why Not. is enjoyably defiant, Gallagher embodying a settled and contented aura. “Gotta live for something besides yesterdays,” Gallagher snarls on “Be Still”. The downbeat “Once” forgoes easy Noel-bashing for a mournful glance at the years when the pair were still speaking (“I remember how you used to shine back then... but you only get to do it once”). And “Now That I’ve Found You” is even somewhat sickly-sweet in tone, a cheery tribute to his daughter Molly, whom he met for the first time when she was 21. “I know it’s late for lullabies, but the future is yours and mine,” he sings, alongside upbeat whoops and Radio 2-friendly guitars.The album takes a deep, contemplative breath on “Short and Sweet”, which is exactly what it promises, a Grace Jones-like ballad on which Howard’s voice takes precedent over inconspicuous guitar, and the background hisses like an old vinyl. On “He Loves Me”, she grapples with maintaining a relationship with God when she’s long since stopped going to church.  It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 467 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.567 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1367 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1467 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1767 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2167 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning.

Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2967 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3167 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3667 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4367 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4567 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5967 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6067 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.6167 Pixies – Beneath the EyrieTales of witchy curses (“On Graveyard Hill”) and spirit reincarnation (“Daniel Boone”) feel like they’ve been dug up from ancient folklore, and capture classic-Pixies menace and ghoulish spirit. Over the album’s 12 tracks, ghostly organs and minor-key guitar-picked sequences help to conjure this dark, Gothic vibe. Yet for all its darkness, Beneath the Eyrie is brimming with the kind of melody that we expect from these indie-rock giants from the late Eighties. “Ready for Love” is a melancholy ballad with harmonising vocals from bassist Paz Lenchantin (Kim Deal’s now-permanent replacement), while lead single “Catfish Kate” – a tale of a woman battling a catfish in a river told by Black Jack Hooligan – is a rock hit in waiting. (Elisa Bray)6267 Jenny Hval – The Practice of LoveThis endlessly fascinating artist’s seventh, full-length, album The Practice of Love is just as considered as 2016\u0027s Blood Bitch, examining one’s role in humankind and on Earth, and probing that favourite of pop-song themes: love. But where the 2017 Nordic Music Prize-winning Blood Bitch was packed with visceral imagery and disarming sonics, the themes of The Practice of Love are encased in a warm cocoon of poetry, blissed-out circling synths and trance-like Nineties beats. (Elisa Bray)This is nomy at their most ambitious and pleasurably weird. As with the dreamy “Upset My Girlfriend”, which speaks of a man about to propose to his partner despite the fight they’re in, it’s an album stranded somewhere between pure joy and unexplainable sadness like slapping on a false smile despite feeling miserable, and recognising how much it helps in the moment. (Adam White)Listening on headphones, I was reminded of the late French designer Janet Laverriere. Born in 1909, she was still a powerful, playful force when I interviewed her for this paper in her eighties. She banged a cast iron radiator with a spoon to celebrate the echoes and curves of essential pipework: “I put all the hard plumbing on the outside. In kitchens, in bathrooms, I am feminist, evidemment!”Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Why Me? Why Not. is enjoyably defiant, Gallagher embodying a settled and contented aura. “Gotta live for something besides yesterdays,” Gallagher snarls on “Be Still”. The downbeat “Once” forgoes easy Noel-bashing for a mournful glance at the years when the pair were still speaking (“I remember how you used to shine back then... but you only get to do it once”). And “Now That I’ve Found You” is even somewhat sickly-sweet in tone, a cheery tribute to his daughter Molly, whom he met for the first time when she was 21. “I know it’s late for lullabies, but the future is yours and mine,” he sings, alongside upbeat whoops and Radio 2-friendly guitars.The album takes a deep, contemplative breath on “Short and Sweet”, which is exactly what it promises, a Grace Jones-like ballad on which Howard’s voice takes precedent over inconspicuous guitar, and the background hisses like an old vinyl. On “He Loves Me”, she grapples with maintaining a relationship with God when she’s long since stopped going to church.

But with the prospects of a deal looking slim, The Independent has been told the recall will now be staged “either way”.“We are in uncharted waters because only God knows what Boris is up to,” said the MP. “Whatever people had been discussing, they are not discussing it in the same context any more because of this move by No 10.”Plotters are wary of giving Downing Street too much notice of their plans, or of striking before a majority is assured, said the MP: “A lot of people are looking for ways to try to get the option of a second referendum onto the table, but we want to make sure we avoid the danger of it not being carried.”Even if passed, any referendum motion would come up against a series of obstacles, including the fact that it would require a money resolution to authorise the substantial spending involved, which can only be tabled by a minister.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s been about all the hopes and dreams we have as iniduals and collectively in this city.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This multi-exposure picture shows USA\u0027s Simone Biles performing on the beam during the women\u0027s team final at the Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in StuttgartExtinction Rebellion activists block an intersection in Melbourne, AustraliaProtesters hold smoke grenades as they gather in central Kiev to demand broader autonomy for separatist territories, part of a plan to end a war with Russian-backed fighters Anti-government protesters rush to an injured man during a demonstration in Baghdad, IraqFootage of a hugely rare polka dot zebra has been captured in Kenya.

Southern states voted to form the Confederacy\u0026nbspin Montgomery in 1861 and the city served as the unofficial republic\u0027s first capital.Last year, the Equal Justice Initiative opened a memorial and museum in Montgomery’s city centre to honour victims of lynching in the racially segregated era after the US Civil War.The city was the site of the pivotal bus boycott, a year-long civil rights protest sparked by black seamstress Rosa Parks, who was famously jailed after refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger as required by law in 1955.The US Supreme Court ultimately ordered Montgomery to end racial segregation on its buses, and Martin Luther King Jr, one of the boycott’s leaders, went on to emerge as one of the most prominent leaders of the American civil rights movement.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She was reportedly later sacked following a row with Robinson.Many women recruited by far-right groups are tempted by the flattering, sometimes obsessive, remarks they will undoubtedly receive from men, and the opportunities for promotion.Women usually climb up the rungs [of groups] really quickly, explains Julia. They get a lot of attention from the male fan base and are almost fetishised... that can be an incentive.Former neo-Nazi Elisa Hategan says joining such groups can be a massive ego boost - as there are usually far more men than women and all the guys want to date you. Elisa was just  when she was recruited into the notorious white supremacist group, the Heritage Front in Canada - and was soon thrust into the limelight as its softer, female face. During her time in the organisation - which disbanded around  - Elisa was taught how to fire a gun, ordered to terrorise anti-racist activists, and even told how to dress and act.[I was told] to dress more provocatively, she recalls.To wear my hair down and keep it long. To flirt with potential recruits in order to get donations.She adds: I’d say there was probably a -to- ratio [of men to women].Canadian far-right activist Lauren, the daughter of a secretary and a web designer, rose to fame around four years ago working for the countrys far-right political website The Rebel Media.Her first video - a verbal attack on feminism  - was an overnight hit.Since then, the -year-old has become a far-right icon internationally, including in Britain, known for blasting Islam and immigration, holding a sign reading “there is no rape culture in the West at a Slutwalk protest, and dubbing Black Lives Matter an ethnic terrorist organisation.Last year, she was even banned from the UK, after handing out leaflets saying Allah is gay and Allah is trans in Luton, Bedfordshire - yet denies being racist or far right.On Instagram, pictures of Lauren smiling in low-cut tops, stroking animals and visiting churches, mountains and cities across the world are interspersed with more sinister snaps.In one, she performs the OK hand sign - which was last month added to a list of hate symbols alongside the swastika. In another, she drinks from a mug reading: Feminism is cancer.But despite Laurens extremist views, some women long to be her.Commenting on an Instagram snap of Lauren in a fitted black dress, one girl told her, You are my role model, someday o wish to be like you, a strong, beautul, smarrrttt. Human being .Another tweeted: You inspired me to get into politics.Lauren, who recently retired from the public political sphere, strokes a dogAnd the same goes for hipster-looking Brittany Sellner  - another far-right activist who peddles right-wing conspiracy theories on YouTube and has also been barred from entering Britain.Brittany - one of Laurens pals, who also denies being an extremist - previously co-hosted an alt-right interview vlog, dedicated to the traditional values that once made Western Civilization great, including... traditional gender roles and love of one’s own culture, race and country.She also runs her own YouTube channel, where she peppers controversial videos with titles like You can no longer criticise illegal immigration with millennial-style vlogs, including one on dating.In a recent anti-feminism clip, named The War On Men, Brittany tells her , subscribers there is a hostile narrative surrounding men that has escalated over the past few years.Brittany, dubbed a white power Barbie, has previously spread the sick lie that Hillary Clinton was part of a paedophile ring and that white people are being systematically eradicated by migrants.She has also been accused of supporting anti-Muslim and anti-migrant views.Yet her , Instagram followers love her. Posting under a snap of the American influencer kissing her husband Martin Sellner, , one wrote: The West needs more people like you two. Martin is an Austrian former neo-Nazi, perhaps best known for leading a stunt where he and his supporters tried to sink rescue ships picking up refugees crossing the Mediterranean.He is also a leader of Generation Identity- Europes largest youth-focused, far-right group which anti-racism campaigners say calls for the segregation of people along racial lines.Two years ago, Julia went undercover with GIs UK branch. And she tells us she was quickly eyed up to become its public face - a decision she believes was largely based on the fact shes female.They were actively trying to recruit young women, she claims.The group initially considered asking Tommy Robinson to be their figurehead, according to Julia, originally from Austria and author of The Rage: The Vicious Circle of Islamist and Far-Right Extremism.But they were concerned that he wastoo old.For Sellner and other key GI players, how their members appear to others is vital.Today, Ben Jones, leader of the UK branch - which spews out propaganda with protests and events - claims it is now known as the Identitarian Movement and is independent of GI groups where.The -year-old tells Sun Online women make up around  per cent of his groups current activists - but admits: Most of that has come about in the past six months.However, he denies specically targeting females: We dont target any demographic except students.Yet one woman in the group - a -year-old called Alice - admits that she and other female members often share ideas about how we can attract more like-minded women to join.Wed love to see our numbers continue to expand, she says, adding that being active on social media is certainly something that the group supports and encourages among our members.Another member Sarah, , tells us social media is a great  to talk with others who believe in the same things you do and also talk to others who dont.Today, former neo-Nazi Elisa believes there are more far right female role models than ever before.Because of the internet, alt-right women such as Lauren, Brittany and others have gained a prominent voice, says the -year-old, from Toronto, who left the Heritage Front aged  and is now director of the charity The Changemaker Project, helping those at risk of radicalisation.The message is that women can be successful in peddling hate.Elisa, seen at another Heritage Front rally, was told to wear her hair down and keep it longAnd as other online profiles crop up of pretty, young far-right women posing like catwalk models and Instagram stars, its likely that they will only continue to lure in girls.There is a much greater awareness that the medium is the message, Elisa says.Andyou want the message to be palatable, the messenger has to be equally disarming.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And hoping to hell she doesn’t suddenly draw Will Carling in that sandpit of hers.Which, mercully, she didn’t. There was just a hospice, a candle and two little heads who were probably William and Harry, but could just as easily have been Wayne Sleep and Simon Le Bon.It passed without major diplomatic incident, though. As did the rest of Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions’ final, where viewers were served up everything from Stavros Flatley and the Ukrainian sandpit woman to Twist And Pulse and the astonishing -year-old German dog dancing girl, Alex Lauenburger, who’s got those mutts of hers drilled like . . . like . . .Well, never mind what she’s got them drilled like. Let’s just say they’ve cocked their little legs all over Pudsey the dog’s grave. There were a couple of failures among the success as well, of course: magician Darcy Oake, who dropped his act in favour of a bereavement story, and American comedian Preacher Lawson.Brilliant, charismatic and funny during the semi-final, Preacher was rushed, confused and barely raised a laugh during the final. Not that any of the judges did him the favour of spelling out the truth. They don’t seem to do that on BGT: The Champions. What they get instead is OTT praise and  hope.Absolutely the oddest thing they did, though, during Saturday’s final, just before Cowell teed up daredevil Bello Nock as “certiably insane”, was getting Ant  Dec to introduce Britain Get Talking, an ITV mental wellness campaign sparked, apparently, by a “ per cent rise in anxiety and depression”.To counter that trend, proceedings were halted and replaced by an awkward silence inside Wembley Arena, so that viewers could communicate with their nearest and dearest, as they probably would’ve done during the following ad break anyway.Opinions on this stunt will, I realise, y wildly. Given there’s no shortage of shows dealing with mental health issues, though, it just looked to me like BGT had jumped on board the virtue-signalling bandwagon.It also flew in the face of light entertainment’s real purpose, to lt the human spirit and remove you from le’s harsh realities for a minute or two.The audience understands thisonly too well, and that’s why Saturday’s top two places were filled by acts who offered no sob stories, just entertainment.Twist And Pulse deservedly won and got the BGT trophy. Stavros Flatley came second, so Deme’s we doesn’t even get that new fridge. What happens to BGT: The Champions next  I’ve no idea and suspect ITV doesn’t either.All we do know for sure, in fact, is the next part of this weird Autumn Cowell trilogy is X Factor: Celebrity, a replacement for the civilian version which was, in part, dragged down by endless audience manipulation and accusations of favouritism.“Megastar” acts on this new show will include Max  Harvey. A new one on me but, lo and behold, turns out they’re managed by Simon Cowell’s mate Tim Byrne, who used to be Creative Director of Syco.ON Friday’s EastEnders Jean Slater said: “I can’t believe they’ve been pretending to like my sausage surprise all these years. It makes me wonder what they think of my fishy basket.”THANKS to Wednesday’s Cape Town jaunt on The Apprentice, I now know there are , shipwrecks off the coast of South Africa, rhinos are not to be confused with elephants and hippos enjoy mating.

It was a shining beacon. Somehow it made everyone, regardless of age or background, feel special.The menu was fresh and new. We had never even seen torn basil or dough balls. The restaurants were in cool locations. There was one above a recording studio in London’s Bloomsbury.When I was in Blur, we lived off those pizzas for years. I’d order two margherita pizzas at a go because they were so cheap.So it is sad to hear the chain, a British staple since , with  restaurants here and in Ireland, is struggling under a mountain of debt.Some p of every £. margherita it sells goes directly to paying off interest. That’s before salaries and rent costs.Social media is mourning its possible demise. Jokers quip that when it folds, it should be renamed Calzone Express.Yet the chain is far from alone. Jamie’s Italian had to close  restaurants this year and , staff lost their jobs. Strada has shut a third of its venues. Prezzo and Carluccio’s have undergone restructuring.Pizza, as a business model, is brilliant. It has the same ingredients as a cheese and tomato sandwich but you can charge £ for it.Yet times have changed. Services such as Deliveroo mean we can have our pick of restaurant food in the comfort of our own homes.Pizza Express is still somewhere wonderfully classless and unfussy. You can just as happily take a date there as a family.Its three-course meal deal for little ones is brilliant and the staff are always wonderful with picky children. My we and five kids love it . . . and so do my girlfriends. It has expanded its menu, with low-calorie options and vegan meals. Yet it still suffered a fall of nearly eight per cent in earnings over the first half of this year.Part of the problem is that until quite recently there were very few places you would really want to eat on the high street.Now we are overwhelmed with choice in the “casual dining” market, with everything from Japanese to Thai to Mexican, plus a lot more pizza options.What’s more, Pizza Express is owned by a Chinese private equity company, Hony Capital, which has greedily expanded the number of venues since it took over the chain in . There are branches everywhere now.That expansion has slowed, with just two new restaurants opening in the first half of the year. It is taking a more measured approach.I always felt the restaurants had a lot of personality and charm, as well as serving great food at affordable prices — all things that were hard to get in the brand’s heyday.Founder Peter Boizot probably never imagined how much the market would change. He fell in love with Italian food while working as a tutor in Florence before going to Cambridge University. Pizza was unusual here then.Movie director Mario Zampi opened a pizzeria called Pizza Express in Soho’s Wardour Street, central London in . But his film-star friends, including Sophia Loren, turned their noses up at such “peasant food”. Boizot was undeterred.He took over Zampi’s restaurant, including its £, of debt, shipped in Britain’s first pizza oven from Naples and sold his first square pizza slices for two shillings a pop on March , .His first chef was a Sicilian aged  who made the dough in the front room of the restaurant, so customers could see it taking shape.That led to the idea of the chain’s open kitchens, which were revolutionary. It was also responsible for introducing Peroni beer to the UK, an Italian classic.While you would usually have to stand in other pizzerias, Boizot brought in tables and proper metal cutlery.As an art collector, he wanted a stylish concept and hired Italian designer Enzo Apicella to work with him across  restaurants.He called his empire a “necklace of inidual gems” rather than a chain.His favourite pizza was a quattro formaggiwith chopped basil and extra green peppers.Boizot sold the business for £million in  and Hony Capital bought it  years later for £million, racking up debts now estimated to be £.billion.The annual interest is £million, wiping out its profits. Experts say the high street favourite is not in immediate danger, as it has until  to start paying back large chunks of this debt.We have seen what happens to similar chains before, though. If we don’t want to lose this one, action must be taken.Sadly, it is hard to see how our high street can survive without government incentives. Business rates are high and parking is often a nightmare.If you care about a business, the best way to support it is with your custom.And I reckon dinner out with the family is probably better value now, and tastier too, than ever before.

In the last three-and-a-half years, the opposite has ­occurred.It has been the British people — calm, patient, amazingly good-humoured — who have set the example to the foaming fools of our political class. It has been the elite that has been rioting and generally behaving like hooligans.Has there ever been a wilder time in the corridors of power, here and abroad  In the House of Commons we have had sit-ins and choruses of communism’s Red Flag anthem.Middle-class vegan eco-warriors — few of them seemingly poor enough to have to earn a living — have set up tents in Trafalgar Square and Whitehall and brought traffic chaos to working Londoners.Top civil servants and privy councillors have almost come to blows. And a prince of the realm and his new we have thrown a massive wobbly about their Press coverage, mere days after most newspapers had showered them in positive publicity.The clincher for me was Piers Morgan’s rivetingly bizarre ITV interview this week with Boris Johnson’s ex-crumpetJenner Arcuri.Here was a network breakfast TV show quizzing a dimpled dolly-bird in Los Angeles for the best part of an hour, feverishly trying to find outshe had had nookie with our Prime Minister.Up and down the country, families were trying to get some cornflakes into the kids before school, while listening to a blonde with a dirty laugh fight off persistent questions about whether or not she had been “intimate” with the head of our country’s government.Look, I’m no vicar. I don’t really care about politicians’ sex lives, though I happen to think people are happier — and lawmakers more trustworthy —they obey their wedding vows. I also thought Morgan did pretty well in the interview. But it was just such a vivid demonstration of the cartoon-ishness of our current predicament.Cartoon seems the right word because so much of what has been happening in British public le has been farcical and obvious to the point of caricature. Look at the behaviour of the Commons Speaker, John Bercow. His self-conduct in the chair of the Commons has been so maniacally biased, it really does belong to an episode of The Simpsons.Bercow has screamed abuse at MPs who have dared criticise him. He has ripped up centuries of procedural custom to bend the rules to the advantage of his Remain-backing friends. One of his family cars even sported a “Bollocks to Brexit” sticker.If someone tried to chair a parish council in such a blatantly preachy, lecturing way, they would be fired before the first item of business had been completed. Yet Bercow, who will finally quit his role at the end of this month, is going to walk into a six-figure pension for the rest of his le — and he is only .The recent party conferences saw ripe behaviour from our political class. The Liberal Democrats passed a motion vowing to ignore the result of our country’s largest ever public vote. Er, how is that “democratic” At Labour’s conference, the apparent result of a key vote was overturned on the blatant say-so of one of Comrade Corbyn’s key commissars. They didn’t bother to have any votes at the Tory con­ference — they never do — but we did have the spectacle of a parliamentary knight of the shires being kicked out of the premises after an alleged contretemps with a doorkeeper.And you should have seen the amount of booze being put away at those party conferences and at the TUC’s shindig a week earlier. Great lakes of alcohol were gulped down, much of it free. This from the same political class that loves to lecture the rest of us about watching our weekly units.Things are not much better where in our body politic. Top judge Lady Hale has been revelling in her notoriety after she and her fellow Supreme Court judges changed the law and thus made Brexit less likely.Judges once kept themselves away from the media fray. Hale, making jokes at Boris Johnson’s expense and giving quite unnecessary self-promotional interviews, has looked swollen-headed and has done nothing to allay fears the judiciary is as bent as Bercow.The police’s reputation is also in the mire after the mishandling of some plainly absurd sex-abuse allegations. The only other person who believed them was Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who is now bleating about the dangers of a No-Deal Brexit.Why should we believe a single word he says  Talking of the police, why are the Met so timid about stopping the Extinction Rebellion protests in London  You can bet thatthose protestors had been massing in favour of a No-Deal Brexit, they’d have been baton-charged and loaded into the back of a Black Maria. And the public’s response to all this  You have, ladies and gentlemen, been magnicent.You have not rioted. You have not risen up in fury. You have found it hard to stomach, I know, but you have kept your humour.

Charlie Gaughan got the temporary inking the night before flying home from a family holiday in Cabo Roig, Spain, this summer. A week after getting the aposevolution of manapos outline on his forearm, the pigment started flaking off and the schoolboy was left with a painful-looking burn that became infected. Doctors said the burn was caused by Paraphenylenediamine- a chemical commonly found in black henna and dark hair dyes. Mum Lisa Gaffney, , from Audenshaw, Greater Manchester, said: When I saw I saw the red mark left behind on his arm I panicked. He said it was itchy like mad but also burning him at the same time and couldnapost settle. I felt it was my fault and felt really bad for him because you donapost want them [your child] to be in pain, you just wish you could take that pain from them. The family, including Lisaaposs mum Carol Gaffney and her partner Mark Byrne, visited a stall in the Costa Blanca resort on August rd and paid  euros for the design.    The artist spent  minutes drawing and filling in the elaborate design, leaving Charlie thrilled with the results. Admin assistant Lisa said:As we walked past each day heaposd seen them and when we were out for a walk on our last night he askedhe could have one. He didnapost want to get it done sooner becauseyou go in chlorine too much sometimes it takes it off.

He was really pleased with it and it was absolutely fine until a week later when it blistered. When Lisa discovered the chemical burn on Charlieaposs arm on August th, the day after the henna flaked off in the shower, she rang  and was advised to go to AE. As the youngster had spent a week with his grandma in York, Lisa took him to York Hospitalaposs AE department where his blistered arm was examined and bandaged. Two days later back at home in Manchester, Lisa was given an appointment with a hospital burns doctor who examined and re-dressed it. [September ].

There a doctor bandaged it and said it would need re-dressing and two days later in Manchester we saw a burns doctor who was really good. He said he didnapost think it would scar and put a special burn cream on it and dressed it again.

Mary Hardiman, , has spent four years writing letters to three prisoner pen pals awaiting death. She said husband Hughie, , who accompanies her on their yearly two-week holidays, and son Kieran, , are supportive. Mary, of Stockport, Cheshire, who works as a counsellor, said: “It’s about looking past their crimes and finding out who these people really are. I have spent money out of my own pocket to visit the prisoners that I have become friends with. I would usually always opt for a sunny beach holiday but over the last year we have holidayed around notorious prisons. I started writing to these prisoners through a charity four years ago, after I heard about a lelines charity through a Catholic conference. Itaposs fair to say that trips like these are not for everyone, but we come back with incredible stories and we think itaposs a far more selfless way to spend our time.    But we donapost just visit prisons, when we go away we treat it as out holiday and visit the area, so itaposs also a holiday in Texas as well as visiting one of my pen pals. Most recently, Mary, started writing to death row inmate Charles Mamou, who has been awaiting lethal injection for murdering a woman in . Sheaposs also corresponding with a separate inmate in Louisiana who she has visited, and is also planning to fly across the pond to meet a third man in Arkansas. Mary said: I met a second death row inmate in Louisiana, and the man Iaposm about to go and meet is Arkansas killed his father and stabbed a female prison officer to death. Itaposs very easy to read what they have done and judge them solely on their crime butwe held everyone to their biggest mistake nobody would be seen as perfect. My husband and son are both very supportive, they understand why I do it. I never know what theyaposve done andthey tell me thataposs up to them, it starts with saying hello and the conversation grows from there.    Earlier this year, Mary visited Charles Chucky Mamou in Texas, US, who has been on death row for  years. Chucky is a really funny man, heaposs very literate and has educated himself whilst heaposs been in prison. I always found him very inquisitive, he would ask hundreds of questions about me whenever I mentioned something new that he could learn about. Chucky is definitely more than his crime, he claims he is innocent, and I have visited him seven times. I asked himhe would want me to be in the room when he is due to be executed andhe wants me to be there I will be. Mary says that she would never do any of this without the approval of her family and that her husband and son are extremely supportive of what she does as they all have a strong faith. She added: Itaposs like a calling and my family understand that, my husband comes with me every time I go. I have spent money out of my own pocket meeting these convicts but itaposs something that I feel I really need to do in order to give them a chance at having a normal conversation without judgement.

Adam Woollard captured a cheeky viral photo of his fast-paced worthy adversary who he usually walks past at around .am. However one day -year-old freelance script writer he lost his pace and was defeated by his adversary. It was then that Adam took a quick snap and penned a post about him. He said he felt happy when he beat him on a previous occasion due to an energy drink pit stop. Adam, from Tufnell Park, North London, said: I would see him pretty much every day I was working at about .am approaching Aldgate East. I would follow him for around ten minutes before weaposd split ways at the traffic lights that go down Commercial Street, which for me is where the race ended. That would be when I would know whether Iaposd beaten him or not. He often beat me because he was quite quick, he wasnapost as tall as me but he had two legs and he knew how to use them - he knew what he was doing. I saw him as a marker for being on time for work andI didnapost see him I assumed he was ill, then I was worried about him, wondering whether he was running late, early, orI was running late. This happened for about a year.    I only ever saw the back of him and from the back he looked like one of my friends. I wasnapost brave enough to turn around and look at him - I didnapost want to ruin it for myself by seeing his face. Adam originally shared a post about his smartly-dressed competitor back in May , which went viral last month. Adamaposs original post read: He doesnapost know it, but me and this guy race on our walk to work every day. Today he got the edge on me because I had to stop and tie my shoelaces but usually I pip him just before the T junction. Never spoken to him, but heaposs a good competitor. A good kid. Strong walker. One time he stopped in to geta lucozade from a Londis and it was the most exciting thing thataposs ever happened to me. I f***ing smashed him that day. Adam walked from Archway to Aldgate East on the three days he was in the office. The -mile round trip took an hour and  minutes each way.    He said as soon as he noticed his soon-to-be competitor walking the same route at .am, he decided to race him. Adam said: When Iaposd see him I would walk behind him for a while just to feel his pace and then I would wait until a good moment. Iaposd have to go in front of him quite late into the game on Commercial Street so he couldnapost sneak up behind me and overtake at the last minute. Iaposd have to leave it to the last possible second to go aposright Iaposm in front of you now and you cannot beat me because weaposre at the end of the raceapos.In the viral Facebook post, Adam reminisced about one time he left his smartly-dressed competitor trailing in his wake.Adam said: One day I think he went in for a little drink - a lucozade or an energy drink probably.  At first I thought aposthis doesnapost feel like a real achievement to beat him by this much because heaposs gone in thereapos. Then I thought aposin F they have pit stops and that countsapos. So I decided it was still winning, it wasnapost by default or a moot race, so I won. I was way in front of him - I left him in the dust - as itaposs busy in shops at that time in the morning with people getting their morning bits. It was end game, no question. Flush with success, Adam shared his emphatic victory with pals on Facebook. Adam said: It was a high that took me through the day. I didnapost bandy it about the office because I didnapost want to be crass, so I just kept it to myself and have a nice little warm glow throughout the day. I put it online because I thought it was something that people in London and other cities would relate to, it feels quite British for some reason, but I didnapost know how far it would go. When Iaposm walking along the street generally people are going into over-drive mode to take over the person in front because theyaposre walking too slowly. So when you find someone whoaposs clearly in the same sort of range as you it becomes a challenge , thataposs the best outcome you can get. Youaposve made a nemesis and, in a way, a friend. He added: I hope he was aware of me. I think he saw the back of me a few times but I donapost knowhe saw it as a race andhe did, maybe he would have beaten me. Now Adam has a new side job two nights a week at a pub and, despite it being only a five minute walk, he has discovered a new adversary - a very quick woman who he pits himself against.

Entrepreneur Thea Thorpe, , is tying the knot with removals firm boss Jack Logan-Beddings, , next summer after both used the site to cheat on their previous partners. The pair met through a dating website for cheats but both insist they have learnt from their mistakes and they trust each other to stay faithful in future. Thea said: Yes, we have both cheated in the past but this is a new start for both us. We both previously had a very liberal attitude towards monogamy.  We thought being in an open relationship was the way to find happiness because le is too short to spend all your le with one partner. But that all changed when I met Jack. I wanted to spend the rest of le with him and that meant ditching the extra-marital dating. I appreciate this is not your conventional love story but they do say that love finds a way - and it certainly has with Jack and I. Jack said: If you had told me that I would meet the woman of my dreams on a cheating site, I never would have believed you. But after my first date with Thea I knew that I never wanted to share her with anyone . I wanted us both to build a future together as a normal man and we.  Thea and Jack first started dating a year ago where they live in West Bridgford, Nottingham, where Thea runs a business training dancers and Jack has a team of removal men working for him. Thea was in a long-term relationship with her boyfriend and Jack was married to his first we. Thea said: We were both in relationships where we had permission to cheat. I was dating several men on a casual basis and was using lots of dating sites. A specialist extra-marital dating site suited me because the kind of people you meet are in open relationships, too.      I had several affairs in this way and thought that I was living the perfect le - with lots of sex but the stability of having a steady partner back at home. For a long time I convinced myself that this is what I really wanted and that I was enjoying the best of both worlds. I would get the giddy excitement you get when you meet a new partner and then, when it all went a bit stale after a few dates, I could just move on without any complications. Then I met Jack and all that changed.  He made me realise that my long-term relationship was a sham and that the flings I was having on the side were just that - meaningless flings. With Jack, I had something much more meaningful and I knew I could not handle the idea of him sleeping with another woman. Within a few dates, we had both left our partners and cancelled our subscription. We have remained faithful to each other ever since and cannot wait to tie the knot next year. Like Thea, Jack had been unfaithful several times and he is still married to his first we. He will only tie the knot with Thea when his orce comes through. I had had other flings with women I had met on dating sites before I met Thea. It was fun at first but it does get a bit tiring moving from one relationship to the next when you are still married.

Full of indiscreet tales about his friends – made up of the most famous names on the planet – the book called Me spares no egos, most especially his own as Sir Elton details his many ­misadventures and mishaps in a brutally honest and tongue-in-cheek fashion. From his unhappy childhood in Pinner, Harrow, to becoming one of he biggest stars on the planet, then nearly losing it all, and finally after  years of fame finding family contentment with David Furnish and their two boys, it’s all there in music’s most revealing read. Here’s just a few of the revelations from the extraordinary le of Elton... Children People think it was a boy called Lev at a Ukrainian orphanage that made Elton realise he wanted to be a father. But he’s revealed his paternal instincts first appeared in South Africa in  on a visit to a Soweto drop-in centre for orphaned children living with HIV. He says: “A small boy wouldn’t sit with the other kids. He just seemed to take a shine to me. He was called Noosa. He was adorable. I realised I felt something that wasn’t pity or fondness. There was a flicker of something more  there.” He discussed adoption with partner David Furnish. In the end they found he was living happily with his grandmother and a sister.    Later that year meeting -month-old Ukrainian Lev convinced Elton he really wanted to be a dad. It proved impossible to adopt little Lev but anonymously Elton worked with a charity to get him and his brother out of an orphanage and fund their lives with their grandmother. Elton adds: “When the Russians invaded Ukraine, we worked with the same charity to evacuate them to Kiev. We’ll always keep an eye on them.” When their oldest son was born at .am on Christmas Day  that visit to Ukraine was still close their hearts. Elton says: “We called him Zachary Jackson Levon. Everybody assumes the last name came from a song Bernie and I wrote, but they’re wrong: he’s named after Lev. He had to be. “Lev was like an angel, a messenger, who taught me something about myself. Lev was the reason we were there, on a maternity ward, holding our son, knowing our lives had completely changed forever.” Princess Diana  The pair were close friends until they fell out when she withdrew support for a book raising funds for AIDs. They reunited after the mxzurder of Gianni Versace, and there is one very famous photograph of the princess consoling the red-eyed grief-stricken singer during the service. But Elton says: “She wasn’t doing anything of the sort. She was leaning past me, reaching for a mint that David offered her. The warm words of comfort coming from her lips at that exact moment were actually: ‘God, I’d love a Polo.’... ...being hrs from death Elton has revealed he was close to dying after contracting a major infection following surgery for prostrate cancer. Touring South America in  the pain became so unbearable he was forced to fly back to the UK. Taken for a scan at King Edward VII’s Hospital, London, he was told he was suffering a rare condition that left fluid leaking from his lymph nodes. And it was so serious the hospital feared it didn’t have the equipment to cope. Elton says: “I lay awake all night, wonderingI was going to die. In the hospital, alone at the dead of night, I prayed, ‘Please don’t let me die, please let me see my kids again’.” He was in intensive care for two days but after doctors drained the lymphatic fluid and gave him with antibiotics he spent seven weeks at home recuperating and learning how to walk again. Rod Stewart    The two great contemporaries have pet names for each other – Elton is nicknamed Sharon and Rod is Phyllis. Elton writes that when people joked about his hair loss Rod sent him a helmet-shaped hairdryer women used to sit under in salons. In relation Elton sent his rival back a Zimmer frame covered in fairy lights. He recounts a story of when Rod was playing Earl’s Court and the promoters advertised the gig by flying a blimp with his face over the venue. Elton says: “I called my management, who hired someone to shoot it down: Apparently it landed on top of a double-decker bus.” The phone soon went. Rod was on the other end and he really did want to talk about it. “Where’s my f***ing balloon gone  It was you, wasn’t it  You cow! You bitch!’” John Lennon First Lennon was his idol, then another great friend. Elton was ­devastated at his murder in New York in . In the previous decade the pair had enjoyed drug-fuelled times. Elton relates one highlight when he and the Beatle were holed up in a hotel suite in New York working their way through a pile of cocaine and there was a knock at the door. Elton was terried it was the police but peeping through the spyhole he realised it was Andy Warhol and went to let him in. The knocking continued but Lennon was having none of it – askingWarhol had “that f***ing camera with him”. Lennon had to askElton wanted to be seen with “icicles of cocaine hanging out of your nose.” Elton obviously did not – and so the world’s most famous pop artist was left in the hotel corridor.  watching porn with his mum at , feet In the seventies Elton used the Boeing , which featured bar, an organ, dining tables, sofas and a TV with a video recorder. Once when travelling on board with his mother, she insisted on watching the pornographic film Deep Throat starring Linda Lovelace while she was eating her lunch. “Everyone’s talking about it, aren’t they  What’s is about then ” she said. Elton remembers the reaction, and his mum’s words: “Oh gawd, no, what’s happening now  Oh! I can’t look! How’s she doing that ” Pop judgment Elton’s manager John Reid played him a pressing of the hit song Bohemian Rhapsody which he described as the “campest thing I have ever heard in my le” thinking it would never be a hit. Shopping Don’t go shopping after a three-day cocaine binge, or: “You wake to a phone call informing you that you have bought a tram. A Melbourne W class drop-centre combination tram, that the voice at the end of the phone is informing you has to be shipped from Australia to Britain, where it can only be delivered by hanging it from two Chinook helicopters.”    Dancing The  song I’m Still Standing was a song requiring a confident video. Helicopter shots were planned with body-painted dancers and Elton cruising in a Bentley. Not only that but Arlene Phillips – later a Strictly Come Dancing judge – would choreograph the dancing. Elton was keen to show off his moves honed at Studio .

One friend said they would be super proud of her. Hundreds of kind-hearted strangers have also donated thousands of pounds to a fundraising page for the young girls.

The cash will also go towards supporting Maicee and Aveyja and hopefully give them a Christmas they deserve.  Dannyaposs cousin Bobby Johnson told : Weaposre absolutely overwhelmed by the amount of people Danny and Kimaposs story has touched. Itaposs heartbreaking thinking about the fact their two girls will have to grow up without their parents. Everyone wants to do their absolute best to make sure Maicee and Aveyja will be OK and well looked after. He added: Itaposs such a warm feeling knowing that people weaposve never even met are getting involved and helping out in any way they can. We just want to thank everyone from the bottom of our hearts who have donated and left their kind words of support. Dannyaposs friend Ben Cook, who set up the fundraising page, has also told how the kindness of strangers has been a huge comfort to grief-stricken relatives. He told the Mirror: The response has been fantastic, the family can’t believe how many kind words and messages are being left. I set the page up in an emotional state and fear I may have underestimated the costs a little.

Jo Emmott-Myles’ waters broke just days before her due date - and after a perfect pregnancy, the expectant mum thought she would be welcoming a healthy baby into the world. But when doctors tried to find a heartbeat, Jo said she knew from their faces it was not good news and she sadly gave birth to daughter Alice, who was stillborn. Throughout her pregnancy, Jo had been considered “low risk” as she had already had a son, Charlie, now . But when her waters broke  weeks into her pregnancy, they were slightly discoloured, rather than clear, and she was advised to attend King’s Mill Hospital, in Sutton-in-Ashfield, for assessment. Jo, , said: “They told me to go in and they took me into the triage room as usual. They tried to find the heartbeat and couldn’t, that’s when they got the portable scanning machine in. “The doctor didn’t even have to say anything, I could tell from his face.”    Jo was then induced before giving birth on February ,  to little Alice. The heartbroken mum said: “I had some complications in the actual birth. I got an infection, Alice had shoulder dystocia so the birth was not only emotionally traumatic, but it was physically traumatic, and the worst thing was it was all quiet. Very weird.”A post-mortem examination found that Alice passed away due to a problem with the placenta, reports Nottinghamshire Live.Jo explained: “When my placenta had formed, there were little parts of it that hadn’t formed fully. Blood clots had occurred in those little parts. “The baby requires more oxygen from the placenta [during labour] but because of this, not enough oxygen was being passed along and that’s why she passed away.” Jo, of Mansfield, has since experienced three further losses.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA railway signalman could have played a key role in the Great Train Robbery, a former British Transport Police detective claims. Thomas Wyn-De-Bank was on duty in the signal box close to the spot where the mail train was raided in the early hours of August , . Now retired detective Graham Satchwell believes it is likely he helped the plot to hijack the London-bound train near Bridego Bridge, south of Leighton Buzzard, Beds, on its way from Glasgow with over £million. In his new book Great Train Robbery Confidential, Mr Satchwell reveals Wyn-De-Bank had a criminal past that could have been used by the gang to coerce him into helping them. Poring over files that have been gathering dust for decades, Mr Satchwell identied inconsistencies in two statements given by Wyn-De-Bank. He also found the signalman failed to follow signal failure procedures after the gang tampered with the light to show a red signal, forcing the driver to stop.    And his book reveals that even the British Rail worker’s son, Charlie, thought his dad “sailed close to the wind”. Charlie told the author his father had concealed from his bosses that, prior to his employment, he had served time in Bedford prison for bigamy. A few years after the robbery, one of the signalman’s colleagues told Charlie he suspected Wyn-De-Bank’s involvement in the heist, which was led by armed robber Bruce Reynolds. Mr Satchwell says Wyn-De-Bank failed to make the appropriate calls after the hijacked train was ided by the gang further down the line, or to raise the alarm as robbers including Ronnie Biggs, Charlie Wilson and Tommy Wisbey were making off with mailbags full of cash. These decisions could have given the gang vital time to get away with the loot. Asked about it afterwards, he first said he knew the train had been uncoupled, but then said he did not know.    In his book, Mr Satchwell writes: “Why was he so negligent  Why didn’t he do his job  It seems to me there are only two possible reasons. “Firstly, he might have willingly taken part in the robbery. If that is the case, then he was obviously hopelessly ill-prepared for the British Rail enquiry. “Once the enquiry was overcome his only remaining hurdle would be to give evidence at the trial where his deceit might be uncovered. “He was certainly aided in hiding the truth, wittingly or otherwise, by the British Railways drive to conceal any negligence on their part.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sugar daddy gives student 21","story":"NewsSugar daddy gives student, , credit card to drain infor feet photosAmy Williams has spent more than £ on clothes for her and her  friends using cash from RichardShareCommentsByBethan Sexton:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news weird-news video dark-secrets-behind-sugar-daddies-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news sugar-daddy-gives-student--\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Having forked out a sizable sum - for a design which was supposed to resemble a graceful peacock, Rena Davis claims the cake looked more like a lop-sided turkey with leprosy with its head coming off. The -year-old said she was heartbroken when, as the baker who made and delivered the cake drove away, one of the peacocksapos heads fell off. And not only that - the supposed fondant icing was in fact mere buttercream. Rena had booked the baker to create her ideal celebration cake, featuring two birds, a heart shaped sponge and chocolate cupcakes. After showing the baker a picture of a similar cake, featuring one blue peacock, the -year-old bride-to-be handed over the cash a month before her big day.  As the weeks ticked by, Rena was reassured that everything was going aposto planapos, but the night before her wedding, she received a completely dferent cake that was falling apart. Despite chasing the baker for a refund, Rena claim she was initially refused until after sharing her ordeal on social media, after which she received an envelope in her letterbox including  yesterday. Rena, from Grfin, in Georgia, US, said: I felt heartbroken. I saw [the cake] and walked out of the room. It was a lop-sided mess - nothing like I thought it would be like. [Before yesterday], weaposd heard nothing from her since. She had not called or anything. The only reason she gave a refund now was because of the viral post. She said she couldnapost give me my money back at first because she had  hours in it and she had to pay her mom for helping.  Shaming the cake on social media, Renaaposs sister-in-law Annette Hill wrote: The one apospeacockapos looks like a turkey with leprosy or something, and the white bird, which isnapost white at all, doesnapost even have a tail or look like a bird in any way, itaposs just a brown BLOB! Thereaposs NOTHING supporting the aposbirdsapos and the cake was already sinking so bad from their weight when it was delivered and it continued to sink worse overnight until the next morning, the day of the wedding, the birds were almost sitting on the bottom layer. So, on the morning of her wedding, the bride was going from store to store trying to find a cake that would be suitable to use for her wedding. After the baker dropped off the wedding cake, which was supposed to feature two green and purple peacocks, one of the birdsapos heads reportedly fell off onto Renaaposs floor. Rena asked for a refund but claims she was immediately refused, so the baker ed aposwith a box of Rice Krispiesapos to try and rebuild the animal.  The cake maker even claimed the fondant icing aposkept getting bubbles in itapos. Rena said: [The baker] had made a cake for my best friend one time. Since then, she had supposedly finished baking school in town. First off we sent her a picture via text and she said she could make the cake. I called her and we agreed she would make the cake in a heart shape, and instead of one peacock she would make two. She came the night before the wedding. She set it up on the table and all the time, Iaposm looking at this cake, thinking aposreally, are you serious apos I just walked out of the room. I had nothing  to say to her. Five minutes after sheaposd left, one of the peacocksapos heads had fallen off. I text her and asked for my money back, but she said sheaposd think what she could do.  The next few minutes she shows up at my house with a box of Rice Krispies. The peacocks were supposed to be fondant too, but I donapost know what she had on them. When she came back so tried to fix the white birdaposs head. She went outside to tell my husband that she had worked  hours on that cake, that sheaposd taken time off her job. It looked like itaposd been thrown together the night before. All I asked her was to please give me my money back. I text her when she left to say the cake was not how it was supposed to be. It wasnapost fondant, it was buttercream, and it wasnapost the colours I wanted. She said aposwell, I couldnapost get the fondant to do right - it kept getting bubbles in itapos. I thought, well at least call me  Never once did I get a call. Everything was always going according to plan and she maintained itaposd be there the night before the wedding. Rena was so upset by the cake, she texted to ask the cake maker to collect it, but she refused. The cake remained in her fridge for three days until after the wedding, when she threw it in the bin.

And while thereaposs always a tempting array of bread and cakes on offer, thereaposs one classic item we find ourselves going back for time after time - the jam doughnut.Filled with oozing strawberry or raspberry jam and covered in a light dusting of sugar, the jam doughnut leaves us licking our lips and wanting more.But weaposve just discovered something about the bakery staple that might shock you.    It turns out that some bakeries use an unexpected ingredient when making their jam doughnuts.Australian doughnut franchise Donut King, which has a branch in Essex, have just revealed the huge industry secret. Speaking to news.au, general manager Andrew Badcock confessed that some food brands donapost use real jam in their jam doughnuts at all.Instead they fill the tasty treats with coloured and flavoured apple paste or sauce.    He explained: Some food brands use apple paste or sauce as the core ingredient in their raspberry jam recipe. With its natural sweetness and no pips, apple sauce is widely used for its smooth and ‘jammy’ texture. He added: Many customers show a proclivity towards smoother and more consistent textures in their food choices as it’s a more familiar and comforting experience. Pips, seeds and smaller grains tend to get caught in teeth and a lot of people don’t appreciate that sensation.    So there you have it folks, the world as we know it, is in fact a lie. Ok, maybe thataposs a little bit dramatic, but weaposre still pretty taken aback by this food bomb that has been dropped on us.Just as we were very surprised when we discovered that fish and chip shops donapost serve proper vinegar. According to  YouTuber   Tom Scott,  many chippies instead use something known as a non-brewed condiment in place of vinegar.A non-brewed condiment is a malt vinegar substitute made from water, acetic acid and ious flavourings - yummy! Youaposve probably never been able to tell the dference between the two, as it looks very similar to the real thing and only tastes slightly dferent, but it takes less time to make and can be purchased in a concentrated form, so it lasts longer.

But thataposs what one mum was left facing after her daughter accidentally ordered a £ three-piece sofa from Amazon. Mum-of-two Isabella McNeil had been in the market for a new couch and browsed through options on her phone when her two-year-old, Rayna, said: Mama, phone. Mama, phone. Isabella handed it over and thought nothing more of it until a few days later when she received a notication informing her that her sofa was on its way.    Shocked, the mum first thought she had bought the furniture in her sleep before remembering she had given her eldest daughter the phone and access to the open Amazon app.The toddler had unwittingly pressed the -click buy it now button and just like that, a new three-piece tufted grey sofa was theirs, as reported by NBC San Diego .Panicking, Isabella quickly began trying to figure out how to cancel the order - but it was too late. In true scarily-efficient Amazon style, the sofa turned up on her doorstep packed in a big cardboard box.    As little Rayna inspected her first big purchase, her mum was learning that there were fees for both restocking the piece of furniture and shipping it back to Amazon, which amounted to just under £. Reluctant to cough up the huge sum, Isabella went online to try and resell the couch at a smaller loss. Her listing read: Brand new in box. Ordered it by mistake, my toddler actually did…darn buy with  click on Amazon. Anyway, it’s more of a hassle to ship back, so I’ll take a loss.    Luckily, Amazon kindly offered her a full refund, and even gave her the option of keeping the sofa or donating it. They also informed her the -click feature on her account had been disabled. Now being able to appreciate the funny side of the story, Isabella hoped her experience would act as a warning for other parents who hand over their phones to keep the little ones happy.

The -year-oldaposs two sons, Phillip Thompson, , and his brother David Thompson, , are on trial for her manslaughter. Photos shown at New South Wales Supreme Court in Australia show the stained mattress where Ms Thompson lay for months. On August ,  paramedics found her naked on the bed when David finally called an ambulance. He told the control room his bedridden mother couldnapost eat and had a wound on her backside, the court heard on Monday.  She was rushed to Blacktown Hospital where she died little more than a week later. Both brothers have pleaded not guilty and are being tried by a judge alone. Prosecutor Jeff Tunks said Ms Thompson became extremely isolated after her husbandaposs death in . He said she was totally dependent on her sons for her nutrition, mobility, and personal hygiene. He told the court the brothers were aware in the weeks before her death that their mumaposs condition was deteriorating. Paramedic Megan Kuhner, who attended the Greystanes house after the triple-zero call, said Ms Thompsonaposs room had a stench and smelt aposreally poorlyapos. Everything was filthy and when Ms Kuhner first looked at the floor she thought it was just dirt and not actually carpet.    The patient, whose pallor was almost greyish, was lying in bed on a towel smelling of urine. It was quite disgusting, Ms Kuhner said. It was just soaked in urine and faecal matter. Ms Thompson had bruises, pressure sores and a large open wound on her bottom, a wound which contained faecal matter. When asked about medical treatment, David Thompson told her: She doesnapost like to see doctors. She is very stubborn. Ms Kuhner noticed both sons were quite clean despite the house being filthy. At one stage, Ms Thompson told her: I am so thankful to have my sons. Triage nurse Lauren Cole said Ms Thompson was pale and generally unkempt and smelt of urine.  She had a deep, red inflamed wound on her bottom which was aposthe size of my fist and I could put my fist in itapos. But defence lawyers told Justice Des Fagan the case was about choices made by the mother, who had previously refused any medical care. We say Shirley Thompson died because of choices she herself made, Tony Evers, acting for the younger brother, said. He claimed she made choices about when,and what to eat, about using the bathroom and about not seeking medical help. It is true the house could have been cleaner, but of course he was not a professional. He was her son, he said.

Luckily on this occasion the home side were able to clear.What the game needed was something special, something to get the fans on their feet and eventually McDaid would deliver exactly that.A -yard strike would fly past Derek Gaston, crash off the post and find the back of the net in what proved to be the perfect settler for both players and fans.It was at this point Dundee played some of their best stuff and Dorrans was involved when the Dee almost grabbed their second on the stroke of half time. He took a smart free-kick, finding McGhee in the middle of the box before he laid off to McDaid, his strike crashing off Ricky Little when it looked certain to go in.That’s the thing about this team, the philosophy manager McPake wants to use can cause impatience in the stands but when they get going, it can be easy on the eye.Especially with strong midfield players like Dorrans, Shaun Byrne and Paul McGowan pulling the strings.It was another well-worked set-piece which brought a second for Dundee and for McDaid.He found Sean Mackie on the byline who ed it to his fellow-winger before McDaid cut inside and rled a spectacular strike into the top corner to double his tally and better his previous long-range strike in the first half.Despite an attempted comeback from the visitors following the second goal, it was always comfortable for Dundee after they doubled their tally – and they could have had even morenot for some poor decision making.The real test lies ahead, though, as they look to follow this result up with another victory.Each league win so far has been followed up by two poor results – an average that simply cannot continueDundee are to have any hope this season."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d9464d32ed745.15718946-846x564.jpg ","title":"dad always said hed be teaching until his final day and he was tributes paid to much loved broughty ferry driving instructor","story":"A driving instructor who helped four generations of families in Broughty Ferry get behind the wheel has died aged .Bill Anderson, of Strome Terrace, who set up Broughty Ferry School of Motoring in , died on Monday having been admitted to hospital two weeks earlier.Bill had been taken in for bowel surgery but developed bronchitis and pneumonia which he was too weak to fight off.He leaves behind his we Norma, , two daughters Lorraine Kneebone, , and Lezley Cassidy, , and four grandchildren Nick, , Ross, , Jamie, , and Tamzyn, .Lorraine said: “Dad was a friendly gentleman, he had a great sense of humour and got on with everyone.“He loved his business.

The work he does defensively probably goes unnoticed.“If you ask the boys in our team about what he does going back the pitch, that’s why they trust him so much and why I trust him so much.“We have challenged him to be better up the pitch like everyone  and on Saturday he was.“I think he needed that wee boost because of his play over the course of the season, particularly going back the game in games when we’ve needed him.“In the Alloa game, Jack Hamilton made the penalty save in that game butMcDaid hadn’t ran  yards to clear the ball at the back post we draw that game and there’s further frustration at the football club.“That’s what he does going that way and we have seen what he can do going the other way on Saturday.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/Mary-Quant-and-models-at-a-footwear-launch-in-1967.--607x564.jpg ","title":"va dundee issue call out for people of tayside to share their mary quant stories ahead of new exhibition","story":"VA Dundee are on the lookout for people living in Tayside who may have worn or made garments designed by Mary Quant.The museum wants to hear from anyone who has a photograph of themselves wearing a garment designed by the iconic fashion designer, before the exhibition opens in Dundee next year.They#re also looking for people who made an item of clothing from a Quant dressmaking pattern, in an effort to learn more about the designer#s influence on communities across the country.Her creations, which captured the spirit of London in the s,were sold in high-end boutiques, whilst her more affordable Ginger Group line could be found in department stores throughout Scotland.Quant’s dressmaking patterns were sold by Butterick and Courtelle, empowering people to create their own piece of designer fashion using fabrics in colours and patterns of their own choice.Meredith More, VA Dundee curator, said: “We’d love to find out more about Mary Quant’s impact on those living in Dundee and Tayside and what her products and style meant to people.Two new exhibitions celebrating club culture and Mary Quant coming to VA Dundee\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp two-new-exhibitions-celebrating-club-culture-and-mary-quant-coming-to-va-dundee embed # secreteYnZMuIznH\" data-secret\"eYnZMuIznH\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“Perhaps you used the Butterick  pattern to make your very own Mary Quant Misses’ jacket  Maybe your Mum was a Quant fan and enjoyed knitting her Courtelle patterns #Or maybe you found a sewing pattern in a charity shop and have made your own unique piece recently “If you have a story about how Mary Quant has influenced your style please get in touch and let us know.”Anyone who has a Quant story or photograph to share is encouraged to get in touch with VA Dundee by emailing sewquant@vandadundee.org or by calling    between am and pm Monday to Friday.Please don’t post photographs or garments to the museum.The exhibition Mary Quant, which is currently on show at VA South Kensington, will run from April  # September  ."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d9da228750e38.20413393-e1570631127103-140x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"win 100 with the teles fantastic strictly come dancing competition every friday","story":"Every Friday whilst Strictly Come Dancing is gracing our TVs the Tele is giving you the chance to cash in!Every Friday, each copy of the Eveningwill have the name of one of the dancers taking part on the show printed on the front page along with a Unique Reference Number.If your dancer is voted off on Sunday then you are in with a chance to win £!TO ENTER:Simply enter your dancer#s name and Unique Reference Number in the boxes below along with your contact details…that’s it!Good luck!Terms  Conditions:Entrants must register by midnight on Saturday, .

I need to keep performing so I stay in the team and hopefully that can help my cause with Wales.”Although Hedges did not receive game time when with Wales last month, he did have the benefit of training with the squad for a week.Hedges made his Welsh debut in the - friendly draw with Panama last November.His last appearance was when starting in the - friendly defeat of Trinidad in March.The experience of training alongside players like Real Madrid’s four-time Champions League Winner Gareth Bale and Juventus’ Aaron Ramsay is invaluable to the winger.He said: “Every single player would want to represent their nation and I am no dferent.“To get the opportunity to go away with Wales is huge. The squad has players like Gareth Bale and you obviously learn as much as you can from him.“To watch him for a week to  days is an unbelievable experience.“The Welsh squad is a bit like Aberdeen, as there are no big egos. With Wales everyone is friendly and it is a good group to be involved in.”Wales are set to face Slovakia away tomorrow night before hosting defeated World Cup finalists Croatia and Ballon d’Or winner Luka Modric in Cardf on Sunday.Wales’ qualier in Slovakia will be played at an empty stadium.Uefa ordered the match be played behind closed doors after penalising the Slovakian Football Association for racist chants by fans.Slovakia were sanctioned under Uefa’s disciplinary process for the behaviour of their away fans in a qualier against Hungary on September .Wales trail second-placed Slovakia by three points but have a game in hand. The Welsh are bidding to reach a second successive Euros, having made the semi-finals in .Hedges: “Hopefully we can get two good results from the qualiers with Slovakia and Croatia as that would put is in good stead for Euro qualication. Playing Slovakia behind closed doors will be a completely dferent environment and experience that the team will have to deal with.”Having missed out on selection for the qualiers, Hedges will use this week to focus on training with the Dons ahead of the games with Motherwell and Celtic after the international break.Having had six players injured for the - draw with Hibs, there are hopes that injury crisis could lessen in time to face Well.Hedges said: “The gaffer has had to rely on some youngsters to come in and shine.“Dean Campbell has stepped into big shoes to fill in for Funso Ojo and Craig Bryson.“He has come in and has done really well, which shows the strength in depth we have.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.46100889-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.46100889-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.46100889-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.46100889-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeen charity guest house to close over lack of funds","story":"A charity-run guest house that helps hospital patients and their families is to close its doors.The British Red Cross has operated the facility on Claremont Place in Aberdeen for more than  years but says it is no longer financially viable.It now plans to sell the building.Four contracted members of staff, as well as four relief staff, will be affected by the closure and are being supported by the charity.Patients and their families would pay to stay at the facility then claim back some of the costs from their health board, with the shortfall met with general Red Cross funds.A spokesman for the British Red Cross said: “After careful consideration we have taken the decision to close the Red Cross Guest House in Claremont Place, Aberdeen.“The guest house has been in operation for over  years, providing a space for patients and their families to stay when attending Aberdeen’s hospitals, however, years of under-occupancy means it is financially impossible for us to continue with this service.“We will continue to offer other British Red Cross services from other locations in the city.”Staff and volunteers at the charity have received a letter advising them of the situation.The letter, written by Marie Hayes, director for independent living and crisis response , said: “With the closure of the Aberdeen Guest House service, the building will now be underused for its size and expensive to continue to maintain.“The sale of the building will allow us to reduce our costs and enable the money realised from the sale to be reinvested in supporting our services.“This will help ensure that our donated income can be used where it has the biggest impact and where people are most vulnerable.”A meeting for staff and volunteers is to be organised later this month to discuss the way forward.A formal consultation process is now under way for the service closure however, the guest house will remain open during that period."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor august 30 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray Surgery are delighted to announce a competition for Lochgilphead High School Pupils to design a new name and logo for our services which has been launched in the High School this week.Our name and logo will be changing, but the care we deliver and how we deliver it will not be changing under our current plans.In  the GPs in Lochgilphead took over the surgeries in Inveraray and Furnace.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

One per cent of this is from collecting, treating and pumping drinking water to homes.A huge amount of energy goes into making tap water safe to drink and Scottish Water is one of the largest single users of electricity in Scotland.The remaining five per cent is from heating water in the home, with around one fth of household heating bills spent on heating water.

These are big, old oaks.Appearing in support of the application, Gavin Yuill, of Galashiels-based Camerons Architects, said: ldquoIn relation to the design and placemaking, the one-and-a-half storey houses proposed are the most common house type in the rural Scottish Borders and in Minto village.ldquoThe two nearest neighbouring houses are both one-and-a-half storey, the set back of both proposed houses is consistent with the street and the stone, wet dash rendered walls, timber cladding, timber windows and doors, natural slate roofs and metal gutters are all consistent with the high-quality materials used in traditional Minto village.ldquoThe overwhelming number of retained trees, the replacement of all lost trees, and substantial new screen and hedge planting will reinforce the existing habitats and ensure that the bioersity is maximised.ldquoThese are demonstrated by the proposed landscaping drawings provided with the application.Also appearing in support of the applicant was Tim Ferguson, of Galashiels-based Ferguson Planning.He told the committee: ldquoA review of the housing analysis into the forthcoming local development plan again shows the signicant benefits windfall sites of this nature can have in meeting housing delivery targets.ldquoThe delivery of the annual housing targets are short of where they require to be and thusproposals of this nature will assist in meeting local needs.ldquoA signicant amount of housing within the Scottish Borders is met via small developments and self-build and indeed has occurred where within the confines of Mintorsquos settlement.ldquoThis subject site falls within the settlement boundary of Minto and is clearly in compliance with related planning policy principles and which has no defined restrictions upon it.Councillors also heard that planning officers are recommending the application be approved, subject to conditions.Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison said: ldquoMuch is made by the objectors that the buildings are not in keeping with Minto, yet the report from officers says that there are no two buildings the same in the village.ldquoTo be honest, they look okay to me but Irsquod need to see them in the context of what is already there.ldquoThe houses already there donrsquot look hugely architecturally important to me but perhaps Irsquom a Philistine.Members of the committee agreed to conduct a site visit, and to reconsider the application at the next meeting of the planning and building standards committee, which is due to meet on Monday, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"planned-early-years-centre-given-go-ahead","story":"COUNCIL planners have approved proposals to extend St Ronanrsquos Primary School in Innerleithen.Scottish Borders Council wants to construct a single-storey extension on the school, in order to meet demand generated by the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to increase entitlement to free early learning and childcare provision.The new space will cater for  children, with  spaces allocated to two to three year olds, and  space set aside for three to five year olds.The plans will also see the relocation of the existing play area, a pumping station and water tank, and fenced nursery garden.A design statement, submitted by the councilrsquos in-house architect, reads: ldquoAccessibility and inclusivity have been a key focus during the design development.ldquoThe provision will be universally accessible and will offer a high-quality learning environment for the children and teaching staff.ldquoThe proposal has been developed to meet current and future teaching with the primary focus being on teaching spaces that are flexible and adaptive to cater for a iety of needs and learning experiences.ldquoThe design ethos has been simplied to provide a hierarchy of spaces from the two to three year oldrsquos playroom up to the three to five year oldrsquos playrooms with intermittent shared activity spaces in-between.ldquoLarge bi-folding doors within the play areas creates easy passage between the indoors and outdoors, encouraging independence and providing additional learning opportunities.ldquoA large canopy running theof the building strengthens the pedagogy of a seamless transition between the spaces and enables children to stay outdoors in wet weather conditions.ldquoFurthermore, it minimises solar gain during sunny weather.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead.

A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

between Tranent and Longniddry, but it is clear the local authority wants the community to have a new name ndash a stance which has upset some.Information packs about the naming consultation process have been sent to schools and the councilrsquos head of development, Douglas Proudfoot, told the Courier at the launch of the naming consultation earlier this month that pupils were ldquofree to choose whatever name their wish.At the same launch, Councillor Willie Innes, the council leader, said that Blindwells ldquomay well appear on the [final] shortlistour young people feel the name should be retained.Yet the Courier has learnt that in letters sent out to headteachers, Mr Innes has made it clear that the council wants a ldquofresh, new name for this new town.This has called into question just how much ldquofreedom pupils really have in the naming process.And the packs sent out to schools say that ldquothe mine was called Blindwells, but we [the council] donrsquot think that fits with all the great new facilities that are going to be in the new town.Harry Cairney, honorary president of Prestonpans Labour Club and president of Scotmid, worked at the mine from  until its

the name, he said.ldquoIrsquod love to know why.

He said: ldquoThis is an issue that will be raised at the next meeting, but I would be very surprisedthe community council didnrsquot decide to write and request Blindwells be added to the list in the final consultation.ldquoWe donrsquot want to lose our industrial heritage.

It would be a pity to lose part of our local heritage.ldquoI feel that it is wrong to disregard the name Blindwells due to the amount of local history attached to the name.Councillor Lachlan Bruce added: ldquoI think itrsquos important that the students have as much freedom as they want when thinking about what to call the new town and that should include Blindwellsthey want to suggest that.Work on building the first homes at Blindwells could get under way at the beginning of next year.More than , houses ndash as well as a school and ious community facilities ndash have the go-ahead, with many more homes expected in the future."},{"url":null,"title":"pub-hairdressers-prestonpans-broken-night","story":"The first incident happened at am on Wednesday at the Railway Tavern on High Street, where damage was caused but nothing was stolen.Police are also investigating a break-in at the nearby  Hairdressers, which took place at about.am.

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

The Prime Ministerrsquos chief adviser might or might not have been the author of an  word note to a Spectator journalist setting out the dire consequences for anyone who dared to scupper the UKrsquos exit from the EU on October , but several Tory MPs, including former Minister Amber Rudd, thought they saw his fingerprints all over it. Eight hundred words, eh  Someone was quite the demented woodpecker.Complaints were made in the Commons about intemperate language from Number , and fevered brows were duly soothed by Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Mr Gove knows Mr Cummings well. When the Scot became Education Secretary he brought him into Government as his adviser. Their ties go back even further, some  years, to when they were both starting out in their careers.Mr Gove is in a select club of those who can claim familiarity with Mr Cummings. Others look to his blog for clues, which is where they will find quote after quote, from TS Eliot to From Russia With Love , to back up his philosophy of government, the universe and everything. If you have an extremely high boredom threshold, and a liking for the kind of macho guano contained in the business section at airport bookshops, I can thoroughly recommend it.: Civil court delays decisionThe Number  aide is not the first adviser to provoke interest. From Marcia Falkender and Alastair Campbell to Nick Timothy and Fiona Hillthere is a special circle in political anorakdom reserved for those unelected iniduals who serve elected politicians.The latest data on special advisers in the UK Government puts their number at . Their salaries, which can range from pound, to pound,, cost the taxpayer pound million. But they are everywhere where politicians gather, from Bute House to the White House, and rarely will you know them by name. Lobby journalists know them, they know each other, and the civil servants know them, but generally speaking the special adviser, or Spad, is the man or woman standing out of sight of the cameras. Like journalists, when they become the story it is time to go. Think Jo Moore, the Labour adviser who will forever be known for saying   was a ldquogood day to bury bad news.Every so often, as in the Moore case, or when a question is asked about the number of advisers and their cost to the public purse, Spads will come under the spotlight, only to fade away again when something more interesting turns up. Mr Cummings has changed that. From sacking a member of staff and having them marched off the premises, as happened with an aide to the Chancellor, Sajid Javid, to ramping up the political temperature, Mr Cummings is rewriting the rules as he goes. Such is Boris Johnsonrsquos reliance on him that he is less a mere aide and more a de facto deputy Prime Minister.Special advisers are nothing new. From the first time someone claimed power over others, courts have had their courtiers. Whether in government or out, their tasks are many and ied. They are supposed to be their bossrsquos eyes and ears, there to pick up on things in advance. They think ahead in other ways, planning the direction of policy, the subjects for legislation or other action. Crucially, they have some control over access to the politician and cling to it for dear le. If anyone can have the ear of the minister, why do they need you : Iain Macwhirter on the blame gameSpecial advisers stayed for the most part behind the curtain until Harold Wilsonrsquos resignation honours of . The ldquolavender list of recipients, some of them highly questionable, was said to have been drawn up on coloured notepaper by Wilsonrsquos chief aide, Marcia Falkender. She denied doing so.Lady Falkender, who died earlier this year, was valued by Wilson for her insights into the minds of so-called ordinary voters she was a tireless planner and she was not afraid of making enemies in the party or in the civil service, especially the latter. The agenda, Wilsonrsquos agenda, had to get through. Remind you of anyone Labour politicians seem to have a thing for the adviser as enforcer. Though neither inidual will relish the companion, this yearrsquos Dominic Cummings was yesteryearrsquos Alastair Campbell. Tony Blairrsquos spokesman wielded extraordinary power, right up to and including putting a case together for war that turned out to be entirely wrong. Campbellrsquos chief asset, as far as Blair was concerned, was his willingness to be an attack dog on the bossrsquos behalf.One can understand why political leaders like to surround themselves with special advisers. As many a memoir sets out, it is tough and lonely at the top. A bad day at the office for most folk is just that, a bad day. For a leader it can be a catastrophe. The stream of questions is relentless, the need to make a decision always pressing. Who would not want to turn to a friendly face, someone you knew was in your corner, at such times  Before the special adviser came along there were such people. There still are such people. They are called civil servants. They can give impartial advice because their tenure is not tied to any one politician or administration.: Brexit deal on brinkAnother argument in favour of special advisers is that they bring new voices and viewpoints into government. Exceptyou had ever met one you would know they did the opposite. The special adviser is a symptom of the wholly unhealthy professionalisation of politics. They look like the politicians they serve, they think like them, and they want the same job eventually.But where is the ultimate harm, you might think, particularly given the modern Spad has to abide by a code of conduct.

Somehow, his mum is to blame, he says, for his le. He may have become a coke-addled, tantrum-throwing, spirit-crushing bully who made the lives of those whorsquod looked after him hell, but that was because he was denied real love. The superstar unplugs the line which connects his partner David Furnishrsquos arrival with disconnection from people whorsquod been with him since he was a Reginald his mother, driver and assistant Bob Halley, publicist Gary Farrow, manager John Reid, etc.George Bernard Shaw once wrote ldquoAll autobiographies are lies. I do not mean unconscious, unintentional lies. I mean deliberate lies. That may be a little harsh therersquos a real chance Elton believes his version of events to be real. And Benjamin Disraeli offered a counterpoint ldquoRead no history nothing but biography, for that is le without theory.But did Disraeli include autobiography  Surely not. You can imagine the former PM spinning like a peerie on reading David Cameronrsquos new tome, or the dreariness of works by Hilary Clinton and Michelle Obama.George Bernard Shaw is really asking the question can any one of us be trusted to tell the truth about ourselves  Do we have the introspection and dare required to present a reality  Is it not the case we are what our friends and familythink we are  How can we put down in print tales of those whom wersquove let down, disappointed or shamed, when our survivalist instinct tells us to try and forget Shaw would surely have cited John Majorrsquos autobiography as an example of dishonesty, in which he failed to mention his affair with Edwina Currie. And HG Wellsrsquo great sleights of hand in Experiment In Autobiography, when leaving out many of his affairs to focus on his two marriages. Or he may even have agreed with Louis Therouxrsquos we when she found the first draft of his memoir to be ldquoa bit dull. Hersquod certainly have found releases by Leslie Phillips, Alan Shearer and Anthea Turner all thoroughly deserving of the Bargain Books placement. Thatrsquos not to say Eltonrsquos new book wonrsquot sell well, but itrsquos mostly down to the showbiz tittle-tattle he offers up, telling, for example how Richard Gere and Sylvester Stallone almost got to a square go after a dinner party, during which they both reckoned they could both ldquodate Princess Diana. The reality is therersquos far more insight to be gained about Elton by reading biographies by the likes of Philip Norman.And having written an account of the le of TV star Brendan OrsquoCarroll I seriously wonderhis autobiography would have mentioned the huge part his former partner Gerry Browne played in the development of his career  .Yet, I canrsquot be a complete hypocrite here. Just last week I prompted actor chum Andy Grey to read ldquothe best autobiography ever written Moss Hartrsquos Act One. He just emailed me back to say he thinks it excellent. This is in spite of the fact that American playwright Hart didnrsquot mention a single sexual relationship.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable. For items like tea bags, coffee grounds or banana skins, recycling food waste is a vital piece of the puzzle in tackling the climate emergency.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The public is being asked to look out for squirrels  both red and grey  for the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey. \"  \"  Join in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey this weekviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"dav\"  Residents urged to support Recycle Week viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"According to the Scottish Government’s  Scottish Household survey, only  per cent of Scottish households say they recycle their food waste, despite around  per cent having access to a food recycling caddy."},{"url":null,"title":"join in the great scottish squirrel survey this week","story":"People are being encouraged to look out for squirrels # and record their sightings # in support of the Saving Scotland#s Red Squirrels project.The Great Scottish Squirrel Survey takes place this week until Sunday, September .During this week – which coincides with National Red Squirrel Week – the public is being encouraged to spend some time exploring the outdoors while keeping a lookout for both red and grey squirrels.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"\"  Nicola Sturgeon: the Scottish Parliament’s greatest achievements viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

There has been a lot of work done already with a lot of preparation and education about culture in South Africa.“It is once in a letime opportunity and will give the students more of a clear direction of what they want to do in le when they come back.”Student Ryan McCarthy explained more about what the trip will entail.“We had to do a lot of fundraising which involved bag packing and setting up pages on Facebook to raise the £, required for cover our travel and donate towards dferent projects out there,” he said. “The first seven days we will spend in homeless shelters before moving to work in villages and towns outside Durban. We will be fully integrated in the community and there will be no luxuries.“We will live with local people and their families and help build houses and other things to help the community and work on dferent projects.“It will be very much a hands-on experience. It is not a holiday for us. We have also been learning the Zulu culture which is everything from song, language, games and dance, which we will use to communicate with the children who don’t speak much English. We want to respect their culture and integrate ourselves into theirs.”Another student, Holly O’Neill, believes she will take a lot from the experience.“I think the trip will teach us a lot about how we take for granted how we live back at home,” she said. “These people in South Africa are poor. We will feel lucky to live here. People complain about all the bad stuff in the news here but it is nothing compared to over there. People have nothing compared to us. The whole experience so far has given us all more confidence. We were all shy and didn’t talk much to each other but now we are all talking more and working together as a team.“The travel is daunting – around  hours – but we are all looking forward to it and want to make the most out of it. I remember the feeling when I got picked for this le changing experience, I was speechless.“The amount of dedication that has to be put in is crazy, but working as a team I know we can get through it.“Something that has really been outstanding for me has definitely been the Monday night groups that I look forward to for a good laugh and good craic.“I’m just so thankful to have been chosen for this le changing experience.”Paddy Doyle from Connections Youth Project added: “I wanted to change the project a bit and develop young leaders within a school environment.“The young people have worked really hard in their preparation so far and I know we are going to have a successful trip.

This is now a dysal system,” she said.“At the heart of this is the refusal of those with the biggest mandates to take the responsibility for governing which comes with those mandates. They know well a deal has long been available but decisions which are unpopular in the short term will need to be made for the long-term good of the healthcare system and public health.“We must never stop being shocked by figures such as these, which are unacceptable and show a decline in planning for the future, going back many years. It is time for comprehensive transformation or there simply will not be a public health service for the next generation # and it is time those with the big mandates took responsibility for delivery of it.”SDLP Deputy Leader Nichola Mallon called the waiting times for a first neurology outpatient appointment “unacceptable”.The North Belfast MLA said that staff are working tirelessly to manage demand while also coping with the biggest patient recall in history. “Neurology patients, people living with conditions like Parkinson’s disease, Motor Neurone disease or multiple sclerosis, should not be forced to endure the pain, worry and uncertainty of waiting over a year to be seen,” she said. “That’s the cruel reality for over , people who understand the seriousness of their condition and desperately want to be seen and treated as quickly as possible.“These patients and the staff working in neurology units deserve better. Aside from the immense challenge of having almost , people on the neurology waiting list, doctors and nurses are trying their best to cope with the biggest patient recall in our history. It must feel overwhelming.“We have had reviews of neurology services before. I have no doubt that the final report will reach similar conclusions with similar recommendations.

It’s the Northern Ireland only Backstop reheated and represents no real compromise.\"Sir Jeffreys party colleague Sammy Wilson said that the offer had already been ruled out by the UK government and described it as a \"non-runner\".\"Whilst the United Kingdom government has put forward sensible and realistic proposals, it is disappointing that the European Union has retreated to its previous failed plans,\" the DUP Brexit spokesperson said.\"This proposal not only rewrites but actually turns the Belfast Agreement’s consent mechanism on its head. Northern Ireland would be trapped until Sinn Fein consented it could leave.\"Sinn Fein vice-President Michelle ONeill also immediately rejected the proposal.\"There can be no situation in which the local assembly is afforded a veto, the EU have been very clear on that point, they have made it consistently,\" the Mid-Ulster MLA told Sky News.\"They are not going to afford a regional assembly with an opportunity to thwart any progress that potentially could be reached between the British Government and the EU, thats where the level of agreement needs to be reached.\"The assembly cant be afforded any veto and particularly the DUP cant be afforded a veto, because they have actively worked against the best interests of the people who live on the island of Ireland. \"Mrs ONeill said that no veto would be considered by Sinn Fein.\"Any situation which would even countenance giving the DUP a say is just not acceptable. Not just to Sinn Fein, it has been roundly rejected by the business community and the other pro-Remain parties and rightly so,\" she said.\"Were close on coming up to  days where we dont have an assembly working, we dont have a government in the North of Ireland. We dont have that for two reasons, one being Brexit, the other being the relationship between the DUP and the Tories.\"There is no conceivable concept whatsoever that could ever convince me or the people who live on the island of Ireland that there would be any good to come from a veto afforded to the Assembly. Lets just rule that out.

The burden on those who started down that road when they endorsed the Prime Minister’s proposals, specically the DUP, is immense.“The DUP have played fast and loose with the union and now we see the entirely predictable outcome of that.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38573258.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/_109142883_constabledowney.jpg","title":"10k for psni officer discriminated against","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

clean-shaven.He later brought an employment tribunal case against then-Chief Constable George Hamilton claiming he had been discriminated against, a view which was supported by an employment tribunal.The PSNI has said it is aware of the tribunals findings and said it is currently examining the detail.Speaking to BBC News NI, Constable Downey said: \"To be turfed out of the unit, with little or no notice, for refusal to shave off a moustache, which doesnt affect the equipment Ive been issued with, is total madness.\"Read MoreMoustache would have to be a ‘belter’ to impair PSNI mask, tribunal toldPSNI ponytail rule not enforced like one for beards, tribunal toldPSNI firearms officer tells tribunal of his face mask concernsNew rules outlawing beards and facial hair were implemented in  for some units in the PSNI due to health and safety concerns.The updated policy required these officers to \"remain clean shaven whilst on duty\" for health and safety reasons.The case centred over whether respiratory masks used in certain police units, and which are supposed to be airtight, can be used safelythe officer has facial hair.Expert advice to the tribunal  previously claimed men would need \"a moustache like a walrus\" for the equipment not to work properly.\"The policy itself was being enforced against men under health and safety grounds, and yet females within our unit had hair in contravention of the same policy, not facial hair but head hair, where there was a grab risk,\" Constable Downey said.\"So the policy was being enforced against men and not against female officers.\"Constable Downey said he tried to accommodate the policy by shaving his beard to a moustache but was also asked to remove that.\"As an older person with a receding hairline

Later, as an MEP, I was pleased to host the PSNI GAC in Brussels.\"A lot of hard work and effort went into setting up this fantastic club by some great people, including Ulster GAA, and it would be a shame to see it discontinued.\"The very existence of this club is of signicant political importance. Their contribution to peace, through sport, in Northern Ireland has been enormous. I hope this rallying cry will focus enough attention and support to ensure its survival and prosperity.\" data-dfpadtargetingPeadar Heffron joined the Police Service of Northern Ireland in A serving officer who has been a long-standing member of the PSNI GAC told the Irish News the club provided a \"safe haven and home to many gaels unable to continue playing with their own clubs for ious reasons, not least security\".\"Like any GAA club, it has given its members lelong friendships and memories,\" he said.The officer, who cannot be identied for security reasons, said at its peak the football team had  players - \"most of whom had previously played at a reasonable club level\".He said the attempted murder of Catholic officer Peadar Heffron in January , who was the then-captain of the team, and the murder of Ronan Kerr, who was from a GAA family, the next year, hit the team hard.It led them to consider closing PSNI GAC, which fields both football and hurling teams, due to fears for players lives.\"At that time, each member of the club had to decide whether they wished to continue their association, identying themselves as Irish Catholic police officers,\" he said.\"Defiantly, when the time came for the next football training a few months later we had a massive turn out, not matched before or since.\"We have played twice on the hallowed turf of Croke Park and competed against our colleagues An Garda Síochána, London politan and NYPD every two years in an international police tournament whilst also playing local club teams in counties Antrim and Down.\"Devastatingly, there has been a slow decline in the clubs fortunes in recent years.\"Since the end of   recruitment the football team has had little to no new blood. Our most recent signings have been open minded colleagues from non-GAA backgrounds willing to give the sport a go.\"They have been brilliant for us and it must be said, very talented footballers.\"With no police officers coming from a GAA background or willing to try the sport, our team has grown old. The average age of the team is now mid to late thirties with a core of players that have been together for the last decade.\"We struggle to get games at the best of times as clubs have reservations about playing us and also have their own season fixtures to contend with.\"This is the first year in memory that we have had to cancel organised games because we cannot field a team, let alone a squad.\"The officer also criticised what he described as \"aggressive and rude\" treatment by civilian staff when attending training.\"I have literally watched a number of them approach my car smiling and friendly, only to become rude and obnoxious, treating me with suspicion as they set eyes on my GAA gear [PSNI GAA gear] as I attend for training.\"However ... you will see a number of civilian soccer teams using the facilities whilst wearing their Glasgow Rangers soccer jerseys without issue.\"Around % of PSNI officers are currently from the Catholic community, while Catholics make up around % of the population of Northern Ireland.In August, Chief Constable Simon Byrne said the PSNI was \"not yet back at the point\" where - recruitment of Protestant and Catholics was needed.The Chief Constable said he wanted to \"convince the people that hold me to account that we have tried every means possible to encourage people from both the Catholic community and also the working-class loyalist community, who I think need a stronger voice in policing\".The PSNI officer who did not wish to be named said: \"It is no exaggeration to say that at least  per cent of all new recruits placed in my district since the end of   are from a Protestant and or unionist background.\"With the lack of Catholic recruits presently, the number of gaels joining the PSNI is non-existent\".He said despite requests and other sports receiving financial support, players due to travel to New York this year for the Police Games have funded the trip themselves to the tune of £, each, which is subsidised by a small amount of sponsorship from GAA supporting businesses.\"All of these ongoing issues will bring an end to the PSNI GAA club,\" the officer said.A police spokesman said: \"PSNI officers are encouraged to join the GAA club, as well as other sports clubs, within the service.

She’s ever so well so far, and is starting to explore her habitat here more and more. “Calves have these incredible large ears which help them to hear approaching predators. At the moment, the new calf’s ears are so big that they almost look out of proportion with her body – but she will grow into them.”The zoo, in partnership with Manchester politan University, is supporting research on the subspecies in Kenya, as well as working with researchers on a potential reintroduction strategy for the endangered animals."},{"url":null,"title":"second largest python ever caught in floridas wilderness subdued by duo","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Other members carried a coffin with ‘NHS’ and ‘DIGNITY written on the side of it.Other messages on fake gravestones signied the death of human rights, mental healthcare, funding in education and health, and the loss of housing and welfare rights.It most certainly caught the attention of weekend shoppers who seemed confused as to whether or not it was a real funeral until they read the messages.At the Guildhall an excerpt from the film I Daniel Blake was played. It is from the funeral scene where his friend Katie reads the eulogy, including the speech Daniel had intended to read at an appeal for his jobseeker’s allowance.The speech describes his feelings about how the welfare system failed him by treating him like a dog instead of a man proud to have paid his dues to society.AAC member, Kat Healy, took to the steps of the Guildhall first to thank those who turned out for the march. In the spirit of the original civil rights march people were taking a stand against injustice, she said.People Before Profit Councillor, Shaun Harkin, also reflected on the march in  which “changed history here in the North of Ireland”. He said the numbers turning out to protest at present don’t accurately represent the depth of “anger” in the local community which is “growing and growing”.Cllr Harkin added that it is important to put pressure on “leaders” to address the devastation felt by local communities.‘Direct Action’googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnother AAC member from Strabane, Michael Mclaughlin, told the crowd that he has been fighting against welfare reform for the best part of a decade.“The system is broken,” he said, and is part of an “ideological attack” on the working class. He referred to a research paper published by a university in Sheffield which studied the impact of welfare reform in the UK.A table included in that report which took in all  local authorities in the UK at the time, shows that people living in Derry and Strabane will be impacted the most with working age adults anticipated to be £ worse off per annum. Blackpool sits at the top of the table, Derry is second, Strabane third and Belfast is fourth.Mr McLaughlin said people can point the finger at Stormont but also need to look “closer to home”. It is time to “inject radicalism into activism”, he said, by getting working class people out on the streets and occupying offices were these cuts are being implemented.“We need to organise a direct action campaign against neo-liberalism, against austerity and expose and call out the parties that have let everybody down.”Member of the Irish Travelling Community, Martin McDonagh, said he was proud to be taking action and made clear that his community has felt the impact of cuts more than most.Becca Bor of Alliance for Choice slammed the two-child policy and benefit cap which she said have “massively increased” child poverty. Although primarily campaigning for free safe legal and local abortion in Ireland, the group has also fought “tooth and nail” against welfare reform, she said.She added that families are having to “scrape” money together essentials and said there is a need to fight so that women and families “have what they need”.The final speaker on the day, Goretti Horgan, of Derry Trades Union Council said large families have been impacted most by benefit caps and self-employed workers such as taxi drivers.She urged people to join a trade union, saying weekends off, holiday pay and sick pay wouldn’t exist without trade unions. “Don’t believe the hype when the Tories say they’re bringing in a living wage, read the small print, they’re saying it will happen in five years by which time normal wage increases will have brought it to that level,” she concluded."},{"url":null,"title":"foyleside student night set biggest best yet","story":" Magician Joel Mawhinney who will be performing mindblowing tricks to students on Foylesides Student NightThere will also be music from Q Radio, giveaways from Red Bull and VIP passes provided by Derry’s top student bars on the night to get students ready for some post-shopping drinks.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTo keep the students refreshed throughout their shopping spree there will be popcorn, slush drinks, a pick ‘n’ mix cart and doughnut walls – there really is something for everyone!Fergal Rafferty, Centre Manager of Foyleside, said: “For this year’s student night, we wanted to introduce entertaining and collaborative activities to get the students excited and encouraged to make great memories with their new peers – as well as grab a few bargains!

Coleman and Gerard Hughes exchanged scores in the aftermath of McManusrsquo red card before Nicholson gave Ballycran a - to - lead after  minutes. Two OrsquoPrey frees levelled matters in the st minute, but the drama was still unfolding.A Martin goal in the st minute put Ballycran into a - to - lead and a point from Phelim Savage increased the lead to four points just before the break.To make matters even worse for Portaferry, they had OrsquoPrey sent off after picking up a second yellow card.Ballycran now had the bit between their teeth and scores after the break from Scott Nicholsonand Phelim and Liam Savage had the McKenna Park side almost out of sight.Martin and Woods increased Ballycranrsquos lead to nine points before Portaferry hit back with scores from Colemanand Conor Mageean to leave the score at - to - with  minutes remaining.Another Coleman point left five in it, but Ballycran simply pulled away and claimed the SHC title for the th time.Ballycranrsquos Mick Branf, who managed the side with Gary Savage, was more than pleased with the way his charges went about the job.ldquoItrsquos unbelievable.

The musket and a creative writing workshop as part of the course inspired Greer to write a poem included in the booklet.Course co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said it was a pleasure to coordinate it, explaining that the  participants came from erse backgrounds.ldquoI was fascinated to see how their learning developed over the course, Shirley said. Many discoveries were made and insights gained into the period but, more importantly, into our attitudes and opinions about this part of the past.ldquoBy choosing the title lsquoour shared historyrsquo for the booklet, the participants demonstrated a key part of the learning, showing how intertwined our past is. I was pleased to see friendships developing during the course and a sense of achievement in the creation of the booklet.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey mdash who opened the conference mdashpraised the impact the PEACE IV project has had on the community.He said that exploring the legacy of the rebellion and the development of the United Irishmen provided participants with an insight into the heritage of their areas and into the very important topic of challenging preconceptions about history, in particular, the areas of shared and contested history.Cllr Casey said the event also provided participants with a chance to work together ldquoacross the community to discover their own stories and those of neighbouring and dferent communities.Further projects on Crime and Punishment in County Down and lsquoPreserving or Plundering rsquo: Museum Collecting from Hans Sloane to Modern Museumsrsquo will take place next year.

This opera will also be presented in Down High School, Downpatrick.DUNDRUM mdash Local councillor Mr Jarlath Carey is to meet local planners soon in an attempt to save a major housing project in Dundrum.Mr Carey will be accompanied by Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue, and Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamon OrsquoNeill, who all condemned a refusal by planners this week to allow the project to go ahead.The project is to develop a -acre site to provide about  new private homes and it has been turned down because it is too big.The planners say the proposed development would be out of scale and character with the existing village and would be prominent in the villagersquos landscape.The have also said the site is outside the area considered suitable for future development in Dundrum.A planning spokesman told local councillors at a meeting on Monday that the bulk of new development of this type should be directed at district towns such as Downpatrick rather that to smaller towns like Dundrum.Mr Carey called on councillors to support a plea to planners to reconsider their decision and said he didnrsquot support the philosophy that larger development projects should go to larger towns.TANNAGHMORE mdash A landmark in the Tannaghmore district for the past century was thoughtlessly destroyed this week mdash not by vandals but by DoE workmen.The landmark took the form of a holly tree, which was shaped like an igloo, and had a seat cut inside it, but it was destroyed when workmen carried out hedge trimming operations in the area.The tree, referred to as the lsquoCourting Treersquo or lsquoCourting Denrsquo by generations, had been maintained for many years by Eddie Kelly. He took pride and delight in looking after the tree, and trimmed it three years a year.A feature in the countryside in the Tannaghmore Road area, the tree was once a rendezvous for the couples of yesteryear. The tradition was thatyou were first at the den, you were set for the night!Many couples fromthe nearly Castlenavan, Seaforde, Loughinisland and Drumaness areas visited the tree regularly, particularly around the turn of the century and after.Now, however, the tree is ruined. The hedge-trimming saw the tree almost dissected and what remains could never be trained back to its former self.This ended the lsquoCourting Treersquosrsquo legend and thatrsquos why residents on the Tannaghmore Road are angry mdash that canrsquot understand how the workmen allowed such destruction to take place.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Police in Ballynahinch are anxious to trace a lsquobogus doctorrsquo who entered the home of an elderly man at Magherahamlet and stole pound.The lsquodoctorrsquo, about  years old, average height, and slim build, was wearing a long, dark coloured coat when he broke into the house on Saturday afternoon. He was found searching drawers in the h ouse by the elderly resident, who is under doctorrsquos care, but he identied himself as a doctor.However, when he left, the man discovered around pound was missing. He contacted police, who believed the intruder was a lsquobogus doctorrsquo.BALLYKINLAR mdash A new training establishment has been set up at Ballykinlar to increase the skills of the Ulster Defence Regiment.This new instructional base will be used by full time and part time members of the UDR who will be taught to counter the increased sophistication of terrorist activity.The camp is staffed by instructors from the UDR, Regular Army units in the province and others from the School of Infantry at Warminster, and will be assisted by the RUC. To date  UDR recruits have completed a four-week course at the camp.HORSE RACING mdash More than  entries have been received for the Ulster Cesarewich meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse on Saturday.The card produces another bumper programme, following on the heels of the successful August Bank meeting, and the entries have been split over six dferent races.The meeting again has had to depend on sponsorship, as the Downpatrick course continues to do what isnrsquot done anywhere  in the racing world mdash carry on racing without government support.Major William Brownlow, in his annual report recently, said that he was confident that racing would continue at Downpatrick mdash the second oldest course in Ireland mdash for at least another few years.

We are always the bridesmaid, never the bride. Not this time. We are walking up the aisle married to the cup, he enthused.ldquoFrom the start of the year the team have worked hard to get to where they are.

2019 Spa.jpg","title":"Spa resident’s delight after ‘nightmare’ over sewer issue resolved  ","story":"A CRUCIAL meeting has taken place to establish the scale of work required at a private housing development at the Spa to bring sewers, a sewage pumping station, roads and footpaths up to standard.Residents who live at the Carnglave Manor development say they have had to experience ldquonightmare conditions for the past six years and are pleased that the Department of Infrastructure is to formally adopt the estate, which will mean it will be responsible for its upkeep.In December , Stuart Boyd and his young family moved into the estate but what followed was years of ongoing drainage issues due to a fault with a pumping station, with the problem exacerbated by the fact part of the  year-old development had not been adopted by the relevant departmental bodies.Mr Boyd mdash whose family home sits in the middle of the development mdash is the first to be affected by ongoing technical issues with the water pump that regulates drainage, with Carnglave Manor also affected by flooding problems due to heavy rainfall which results in drains overflowing and sandbags being used to stop water reaching residentsrsquo homes.The frustrated resident revealed that within weeks of moving into the new family home, issues started to arise, with the first problem starting in the en-suite shower where water was not fully draining away after the shower had been turned off. Mr Boyd said he checked for blockages but discovered none.The en-suite toilet started to experience problems by not fully draining after flushing, with water rising to the top of the rim. Then a second toilet became affected with the same issue and could not be used.Mr Boyd contacted NI Water and was informed that the problem could not be investigated fully due to the fact that part of the development had not been adopted and that the issue was ldquohistorical.However, emergency action was taken for the problem to be resolved temporarily and the drains were cleared.A matter of weeks later, the same issue happened again and Mr Boyd made contact with the developer who informed him of a ldquoquick fix to resolve the problem.ldquoI was told by the developer that to sort the problem was to restart the sewage station pump by pressing buttons on an electrical , he said.ldquoThis worked fine over the years but became tedious as I had to do it so often. When my we was heavily pregnant with our third child two years ago the problem happened again, but the switch I normally pressed failed to work.Mr Boyd said repairs were then carried out and steps seemed to be taking place to adopt the street in Carnglave Manor. He was also concerned that despite being told a formal adoption would take place, nothing happened.The resident contacted Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis to investigate the issue and is delighted that things are now moving in the right direction as a result of him putting pressure on the relevant departments.Cllr Lewis described the adoption of Carnglave Manor as ldquoan immediate necessity for the progression of completion and resident safety and that the issue had been allowed to go on for too long. He said a process had begun to access so-called bond monies to carry out the necessary repairs.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThere are a number of issues with the equipment which remain unresolved and NI Water and roads officials have been working in collaboration toward ensuring that bond monies paid by the contractor are utilised to ensure that necessary repairs are carried out which would bring the pumping station up to spec for adoption.The councillor said he was ldquohorried to discover Mr Boyd had been educated on the operation of the pumping equipment to ensure proper drainage which sometimes involved him walking down the street in the middle of the night to reset the electronic pump.ldquoI am also advised that residents have in previous years unblocked drains and battled flood waters they have been living in absolute horror. The purchase of a family home should be joyous, exciting and fulfilling. Instead, residents have had to endure misery, worry, stress strain and hassle.Cllr Lewis confirmed that due to frequent periods of heavy flooding in the development he has contacted Rivers Agency requesting flood maps to assessthe area is prone to or at risk of flooding and has asked Land and Property Services to explore the possibility of a rates rebate for Carnglave Manor residents.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said she aware of the situation at Carnglave Manor and, as the developer had failed to complete the site to the appropriate standard, had initiated enforcement action.ldquoThis is with a view to carrying out the necessary works to bring the sewers, sewerage pumping station and roads footways up to adoption standard, she explained.The spokeswoman added: ldquoThe Department is meeting with Northern Ireland Water this week to fully establish the extent of defects in the sewers and sewerage pumping station. The extent and nature of this work will largely dictate the timeframe going forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd October 2019 Speeders.jpg","title":"Speeders ‘to face pupils in school trial’  ","story":"DRIVERS caught speeding past local primary schools could soon find themselves in front of pupils who will decide their punishment at a kidsrsquo court.As part of a radical new initiative being proposed by the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, drivers caught speeding outside a school will be given the option of avoiding a fine by attending a special court where the judges are children.Motorists who do not want to participate in the initiative will have to pay a speeding fine and accept penalty points on their driving licences.The idea of kidsrsquo courts started in England and now is being trialled in Northern Ireland. After each appearance in front of their juvenile worships the offending drivers then watch graphic road safety videos featuring more children, with the goal to change driver behaviour.Those behind the scheme say itrsquos a simple but effective idea where PSNI road safety officers will liaise with particular schools about running kidsrsquo courts or teachers as part of road safety classes.When the go-ahead for the scheme is given, police turn up outside schools on the given morning and anyone they detect ndash as long as they are not travelling inordinately fast mdash will have the option there and then of appearing in front of the children, or taking the fine and penalty points.The PSNI is supporting the new initiative, which has proved successful in other areas, with officers hoping that meeting children face-to-face will change driversrsquo behaviour.The districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnershipis driving the change for an increased focus on road safety across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area with the emphasis on reducing speed to make the areas safer for drivers and pedestrians.And the organisation is fully behind the kidsrsquo court scheme which provides children with an opportunity to talk directly to drivers and send a very clear message about road safety.In addition to the kidsrsquo courts, other measures the PCSP wants to provide include a general road safety awareness campaign across the district, distribution of school safety signs and the installation of speed indicator devices.Local politicians describe the kidsrsquo court initiative as ldquoproactive and say that it will highlight to drivers the vulnerability of children aged between three and  who attend primary schools across the district.They say children will effectively be educating drivers who have exceeded the speed limit outside their respective schools to the potential of what could have happened. Politicians say the scheme is not trying to catch people out, but make the roads safer for everyone.Local councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Willie Clarke have welcomed the new initiative and hope people across the district will be more road safety aware. They believe that working with young people is a very effective way to deliver the road safety message.In addition, they also believe thatthe kidsrsquo court is successful in changing the mindset of even a few drivers it will help make busy roads outside primary schools much safer.Cllr Hanlon said she has been contacted by many primary schools in rural areas, requesting assistance with road safety around their respective locations.She said that with large volumes of children being ped off and picked up within short timeframes, the school run can become a ldquodangerous experience for young pupils in particular.Cllr Hanlon continued: ldquoSchool safety signs will be a visual reminder for drivers to exercise extra caution. Motorists caught speeding outside a primary school will be given the option of avoiding a fine by attending a special lsquokidsrsquo courtsrsquo where the judges are children.ldquoIn front of a  of young pupils, drivers will have to explain why they have broken the speed limit and itrsquos hoped that face-to-face interaction will change driversrsquo behaviour.She added: ldquoThis concept not only empowers our young people but also challenges motorists from a childrsquos perspective on why they would break rules which endanger their safety.Cllr Clarke said road safety was an issue he had campaigned on tirelessly over the years and particularly welcomed the introduction of speed indicator devices across the district.He added: ldquoThis has proved every successful in other areas in reducing speed and increasing safety on our roads..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10505352.jpg","title":"bandstand baby witch","story":"Who are the members of your band and what instrument do they play How would you describe your sound What local gigs do you have coming up What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences What inspires your songwriting What is your dream gig What is the best thing about performing Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees.

Like the overwhelming majority of Welsh and British people, they are perfectly capable of expressing that view without resorting to threats, aggression or violence.We must all learn to disagree well, however robust our views and remember that we all share this country and this planet - and that we genuinely have more in common.Meanwhile, it has been another extraordinary week in these turbulent political times.After we had the shock news that I wrote about last week ndash that the Supreme Court had delivered a unanimous judgement that Parliament should not have been shut down by the PM ndash we were able to go back immediately.I was straight back to Westminster having meetings with colleagues, holding the government to account, and of course getting back to work not just on Brexit but on many other issues.I was able to raise concerns in the Commons on behalf of constituents relating to the Thomas Cook collapse, which has affected everybody from holiday-makers to pilots to holiday reps and retail workers in the constituency and to call for a debate on the incineration of waste.And on Monday, I joined Allied Steel and Wire Pensioners from the constituency, and others hit by pensions theft, to hand in a petition to the Prime Minister at  Downing Street. They deserve justice on their pensions and have my full support. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Armagh crossroads, plagued with a high level of accidents, is to get a reduced speed limit after intense lobbying by residents.Local MLA William Irwin has been at the forefront of the campaign to have traffic calming at Ardress crossroads.The DUP MLA welcomed additional signage and awareness works at the notorious junction.Crash after crash has beenhighlighted by the MLA and he has echoed the warnings by local residents that ‘sooner or later someone will get killed’.Mr Irwin has been consistently lobbying for improvements and he welcomed what he called a “very focused lobby” from residents in the vicinity in assisting in relaying real concerns over safety at the crossroads.Mr Irwin said: “These additional works including the implementation of a mph speed limit and extra signage and road markings is very welcomed and I thank Transport NI for their continued efforts in this regard.”He continued: “There has been a high level of collisions at this location and I know that residents and road users generally have been really concerned that sooner or later a fatality will occur. “A number of improvements have been made in recent times however, worryingly, accidents still occur at an alarming rate. “Residents have been very proactive in their lobby and I have joined fully with them in continuing my lobby for improvements. “This is seeing results which is pleasing to see from a safety point of view,” said the DUP MLA.Mr Irwin said:“Additional signs have been erected including a speed limit and there are more warning markings etc to be added to all approaches to the crossroads.“And I am hopeful that this will help in alerting drivers to the fact that they must stop at the junction and wait until the route is clear. “I will continue with the residents to monitor this issue and continue to raise their concerns going forward.” PSNI probe ‘serious’ assaults which left victims hospitalisedThieves ransack woman’ home while she was out on volunteer community work

Of course, it didn’t help that as I reached out online to find information, all I came across was images and stories of people with perfect lives doing everything correctly. This didn’t provide me with the support or confidence I needed, and I felt it wasn’t accurate and it just added to the stress already present in my le.”“Fortunately, my previous job as a personal trainer, coaching athletes such as the Irish Olympic Handball team, gave me the skills to know what to do when faced with a challenge and I realised that I needed help.

The secret Masterplan has been sought after for several years with many groups and activists keen to get a copy.Alliance Councillor Eóin Tennyson, who was elected last May to the new council, says he also has been unable to see a copy of the Masterplan.He called for an end to secrecy as Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council appeal a ruling by the Information Commission requiring the release of the South Lake Masterplan. Speaking after the Alliance group on Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Council once again requested the release of the document, Eóin said: “The Council’s ongoing refusal to place the South Lake Masterplan in the public realm falls far short of the standard of open and transparent governance citizens in our borough rightly expect. “It is totally unacceptable that – despite our numerous requests – even elected representatives have not been given sight of the document.“In June , the Information Commission ruled that Council had not applied the regulations for withholding information correctly, and ordered release of the document within  calendar days,” said Cllr Tennyson.“What’s more concerning is that Council then took a backroom decision to appeal this ruling, without consulting elected representatives,” he said. “Alliance is committed to openness and transparency,” saidCllr Tennyson.“In our view, fighting disclosure of a document that the public and their representatives ought to have had sight of from the outset is a wholly inappropriate and worrying use of ratepayer’s money,” said the councillor.“We will continue to push for progress on this matter and hold ABC Council to account.”A spokesperson for Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Council said: “The Council is not in a position to comment given that this matter is subject to ongoing active legal proceedings.”‘Scourge of drugs and dissident republicans’ topics of DUP meeting with senior PSNI chief Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingNotorious NI crossroads, plagued with accidents, to get reduced speed limitThieves ransack womanrsquo home while she was out on volunteer community workEmergency services at scene of serious N.I. road traffic collision -

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here. SONIhas said the five-year plan to transform the power system here will enable it to handle % renewable energy at any one time. This is a signicant increase from the current figure of % and is said to be a \"world leading level, ensuring maximum value from wind and other sources\". To achieve this, it is expected that the amount of renewable energy connected to the grid will need to double by . At the moment, approximately  MW of renewable energy is connected to the NI power system. SONI managing director Jo Aston said that the strategy was a \"direct response to the climate crisis and the UK Governments commitment to zero net carbon emissions by \" “To do this we must innovate for the next generation while ensuring today’s electricity users have a reliable, secure and cost-effective supply,” she said.

Currently, approximately  MW of renewable energy is connected to the NI power system. Noel Lavery, permanent secretary at the Department for the Economy, said: “SONI’s investment in innovative engineering solutions has provided the backbone to bring as much wind energy onto the system in Northern Ireland as possible and helped us reach the recently-reported figure of % of Northern Ireland’s electricity being consumed from renewable sources in the past  months.  “I welcome SONI’s updated strategy for Northern Ireland, ensuring that it continues to strive for best value for money for the Northern Ireland consumer, while helping to tackle climate change.  “I also look forward to the ongoing engagement with SONI as a key stakeholder in developing the new ‘energy strategy’ for Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/2_web.jpg","title":"top  voice of business never stronger or more important","story":"Posted on Friday  September  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew, Michael Neill, Sarah Little and Len OHagan The voice of Northern Ireland’s business community has never been stronger and more important as industry attempts to avoid a hard Brexit, a gathering of top business leaders has heard. The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years.

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
