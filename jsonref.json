It will increase risk to patients and their families, healthcare staff and the general public. It will also have a significant impact on the recruitment and retention of psychiatrists.”Act revisionThe Government has failed to genuinely consult with psychiatrists, GPs and family members of people with mental illness on the new legislation, it is claimed.The long-awaited revision of the 2001 Act began last July when the Government published the heads of the revised Bill. The legislation is currently under scrutiny in the Oireachtas. The psychiatrists’ concerns are with the changed grounds for detention under the planned new legislation. Previously, the Mental Health Acts allowed detention on the grounds of presence of mental disorder and either presence of risk andor need for treatment. Revised criteria as currently proposed state that admission must be “immediately necessary for the protection of the life of the person, for protection from serious threat to the health of the person and the protection of others”.The psychiatrists argue this means the Act cannot be used to detain a person until there is already a serious risk present. Up to now, they say, families and doctors familiar with the patients could detect “early signs of relapse which are unfortunately sometimes accompanied by lack of insight for the patient”.‘Stigmatising’ stipulation“This allowed for families and health professionals to begin to seek treatment before the inevitable progression of the illness. However, now the mental illness (such as psychosis or bipolar disorder) will need to be advanced to the point where there is a risk to life or health before treatment can commence.” There is no other illness where doctors have to wait for a patient to deteriorate to a life-threatening state before treatment can be initiated, they say.If patients do not seek treatments themselves – and some can have an inability to function – they will go untreated “indefinitely” unless they present with a serious, immediate risk, the college says.“The stipulation that someone with severe mental illness who lacks capacity cannot access treatment unless they pose a serious threat to themselves or others is stigmatising for mentally ill patients.”Changes to the operation of mental health tribunals and review boards will impose additional demands on consultant psychiatrists and force the cancellation of patient clinics, the college says.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"over one third of north s population hold irish passport","story":"Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, was due to pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the UK withdrew from the EU.  More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"maureen dowd zelenskiy hamlet and an irrational soulless fiend","story":"Members of the Kyiv-Classic symphonic orchestra perform at Independence Square demanding to close the sky over Ukraine to shield it from Russian aerial attack. Photograph: Zurab KurtsikidzeFor actors, it is the most gripping, feared line ever written. “It is the Mona Lisa of literature,” said Simon Godwin, the director of the Shakespeare Theatre Company here. “It is something we’re so deeply familiar with, it is hard to bring new context to, and to make it live again.”So it was stunning when an actor not known for classical performance spoke the opening of Hamlet’s soliloquy with more dramatic weight than Gielgud, Burton, Olivier or Cumberbatch.“The question for us now is to be or not to be,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the British parliament in a video call on Tuesday, speaking in Ukrainian. “This is the Shakespearean question. For 13 days, this question could have been asked. But now I can give you a definitive answer. It’s definitely yes, to be.”As Godwin noted of the TV sitcom actor turned Ukrainian wartime president: “He has become, in a way, the world’s greatest actor engaged with the world’s deepest truth, using a piece of poetry to express this truth in a forceful context.”Shakespeare, who knew that character is revealed when the stakes are high, would have approved. Zelenskiy has taken up arms against “a sea of troubles”. As Drew Lichtenberg, resident dramaturge at the Shakespeare Theatre Company, points out, Hamlet’s disquiet about suicide and dying has a resonance in the part of the world now bearing the slings and arrows of a demented dictator.“There’s a long tradition in Central European countries, such as Poland or Ukraine, of embracing Shakespeare and especially Hamlet as a kind of metaphor for the broader political situation,” he said. “Poland and Ukraine both have had periods where they didn’t exist, where their language was erased and replaced by either German or Russian as the official language and culture of the state. They know what it is ‘not to be’.”Culture of greedWhat made the Ukrainian president’s delivery so powerful was that the world is caught up in the existential questions raised by the moody prince of Denmark. Will Zelenskiy live or die when Russian forces bear down? Will Ukraine exist as a sovereign nation? What does this crisis mean for the identity of America and the West ? Who will we be when this is over? Will the planet even survive?Zelenskiy and the Ukrainians chose to stand for something, and to be. They are united as a democracy in a way that America has not been for a long time, as we have become more and more riven over politics, with burning questions of reality and artifice with the destructive partisanship of masks and Covid-19 and with the corrosive effect of our culture of greed, selfishness and billionaires.Ukraine is showing a collective will, an inspiring community of people working together. Their heroic efforts against a gobbling tyrant set on empire recall America’s own beginning. They have also shown military experts that in a conventional war, the United States would smoke Russia. Its military has been shockingly slow and stumbling, even as it has inflamed people around the world by killing children and fleeing civilians.President Joe Biden and his generals are facing their own existential moment as they try to figure out the incredibly knotty problem of where the line is. Are Javelins okay and MiGs too far? How do we do everything we can to help Ukraine without spurring a sadistic and unhinged Vladimir Putin to start World War III and a nuclear conflagration?‘Close the sky’Despite the threat, we must stand by Ukraine in what its ambassador to the US, Oksana Markarova, calls “the 1939 moment” of good versus evil. As Illia Ponomarenko, a reporter for the Kyiv Independent, tweeted on Friday (vulgarity excised): “I wonder how many Ukrainian cities Russia needs to carpet-bomb until the West realises that every time it refuses to give Ukraine a weapon for ‘fear of provoking Putin’ is an invitation for further escalation in war.”I talked to George Pataki, the former governor of New York, who is in Ukraine, near Hungary, helping refugees. “When we ask Ukrainians what they most want, the answer we always get is ‘Close the sky’ because families, homes and towns are being devastated from above by the Russian military,” he said. “And it’s very disappointing not to be able to answer that question. I understand we’re not going to create a no-fly zone, but we should give the Ukrainians the material support to enable them to create their own no-fly zone.”Echoing our military leaders, Michael McFaul, former ambassador to Russia, told Stephen Colbert on Thursday night that a “no-fly zone is a euphemism for a declaration of war. That means an American pilot shoots down a Russian pilot, and that’s a declaration of war.” Give Ukraine everything short of that in terms of military weapons and sanctions, he said.The attenuated debacles in Iraq and Afghanistan have left many Americans weary of conflict. But this is no time for us to withdraw into ourselves. It is a horrible position that Biden is in, dealing with an irrational, soulless fiend with more than 4,000 nukes who thinks he can glue the Soviet empire back together with the blood of innocents.

By the time they arrive for their very first day, disadvantaged kids are already four months’ learning behind their more privileged peers. Yet these are not normal times. Two years of Covid shutdowns have led to educational consequences that grimly rival those of a deprived upbringing – but for all.After the first lockdown, for example, the latest data suggests average primary school pupils were 3.6 months adrift of the level in maths that pre-pandemic years had achieved at the same stage. Children in some parts of the country fared far worse. In Yorkshire and the Humber, the gap was 5.7 months. When it came to reading, primary children unlucky enough to find themselves in the Covid cohort were on average just under two months behind. The question now for teachers, parents and the Government is whether they will ever catch up, or whether the years of disruption they have encountered today will cascade through the rest of their lives, impacting university and career prospects and their personal lives, too. It was never meant to be like this. But temporary emergency measures have morphed into a two-year trial, with repeated lockdowns, homeschooling, and the pingdemic puncturing entire class bubbles. Still, it goes on.In January, almost one in 12 teachers was off work. Last week, MPs declared the Government’s £5 billion National Tutoring Programme to help disadvantaged children “level up” after Covid to be a costly failure. Meanwhile, according to the Centre for Social Justice, 100,000 “ghost children” – those who miss more than half their school sessions – have almost entirely disappeared from education since last year’s return to schools.Making good will not be easy. Deprived children may start school only four months behind, but generally they don’t catch up. According to Natalie Perera, CEO of the Education Policy Institute (EPI), by the time they leave education, the gap has widened to 18 months. So will Britain’s Covid cohort suffer a similar fate?The stakes for them, and the nation, could hardly be higher. Work by the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests that every extra year of schooling adds eight per cent to lifetime earnings. Other studies put the figure even higher, between 10 and 15 per cent. Using these estimates, the EPI has calculated that Britain’s Covid cohort is likely to lose between £15,604 and £30,881 each over their careers. Pessimistic scenarios put the loss as high as £46,321 per child – adding up to £463 billion for all affected children in England. The World Bank calculates that, globally, such Covid-inflicted salary losses could add up to an astonishing $10 trillion (£7.6 trillion).Nor are the impacts on children purely academic, or their consequences solely financial. Repeated lockdowns are likely to take a significant toll on young people’s physical health given that, in 2019, a study suggested that people were 6.85 per cent less likely to report poor health in later life for one additional year of schooling.Meanwhile, surveyed by the charity Young Minds, two-thirds of children said they expected repeated lockdowns to leave long-term scars on their mental health. This is borne out by teachers who have seen children regress, not just in their studies, but in their social behaviour. Suddenly, the function of classrooms not just as places of learning, but of pastoral care, has become all too evident.Many places saw a rise in children referred to social services. In Middlesbrough, the number rose by 40 per cent year on year. As Amanda Spielman, Ofsted’s Chief Inspector, wrote in her recent annual report: “This was a difficult year to be young, and a challenging time to be learning. In all phases of education in 202021, most children and young people have learned less than they normally would have done. For many, the loss of education, disrupted routine and lack of physical and other activities led to physical and mental health problems. Loneliness, boredom and misery became endemic among the young.”After a wide-ranging survey, the Children’s Commissioner compiled some heartbreaking tales. One 10-year-old boy confessed: “My reading and spelling is not very good. All the words get muddled up and I need more help in class, but I can’t always have it.” A nine-year-old girl added: “Lockdown really stops children, because they can’t do that much stuff we love and it makes them go all shaky.”Some children will never have known anything else: six-year-olds now in Year 2 might be forgiven for forgetting the brief spell of normality they enjoyed after joining Reception in September 2019. By the following March, their educational landscape was blasted by the first lockdown their Year 1 was shattered by its successor in spring 2021. Headteachers are faced with pupils far behind usual developmental milestones: five- and six-year-olds in nappies isolated four- and five-year-olds, shorn of pre-school playdates, group childcare, contact with grandparents, and confronted by a world wearing masks, arriving on their first day with few words to express themselves, and boiling with frustration in consequence. The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) found that more than three quarters of primary schools said pupils starting school in September 2020 needed more support with communication than in previous years. Isolated in the pandemic, with fewer opportunities for play, toddlers tested in the past two years for language, puzzle-solving and motor skills are far behind those tested last decade. “Things just began sort of falling off a rock,” said one scientist studying infant cognition.The damage may even be starting in the womb. The journal Nature recently reported on research suggesting that “pandemic-related stress during pregnancy could be negatively affecting foetal brain development”.Despite all this, there is cause for hope. Children – particularly young children – are rubbery creatures, with “bounceback-ability”. Researchers are confident that slow-starting toddlers can catch up. And at primary school age, too, the data shows that children released from lockdowns have pegged back some of their losses. By the end of last academic year, the average lag in maths had fallen from the 3.6 months of autumn 2020, to 2.2 months. Yorkshire and the Humber, which had fallen almost half a year behind, had recovered 3.8 months. Recovery is possible. Indeed, children have been shown to bounce back before, as they did after rural communities and schooling were hit (though much less severely) by the foot-and-mouth outbreak of 2001. They can overcome social barriers, too. In 1975, the psychologist Edward Tronick conducted the famous “Still Face” experiment which showed how toddlers of parents instructed to remain expressionless first courted their attention, then turned inward and withdrew. Repeating the experiment almost half a century later, this time with facemasks, did not produce the same results. The children were able to feed off other cues to communicate and bond. Older children, however, struggle more to recover. Secondary school children, who quickly fell behind an average of 1.5 months in reading after the first lockdown, have barely made up any lost ground after returning to class. It is tempting to tell parents that this is no problem – that all children are facing the same challenges and suffering the same setbacks. Yet study after study suggests this is not true. The gap between those who were homeschooled by well-educated, WFH parents with plenty of time, money and laptops and those who weren’t is growing wider and wider. Teachers struggle to  the ever-widening spectrum of ability they see in a single class. Those with funds flee to private schools, only entrenching inequality. The EPI is calling for a host of targeted measures – better early-years teachers, one-to-one tuition for struggling children, and afterschool activities rather than an extension of the school day, which might involve catch-up lessons but could simply be about socialising and sports.But it will take money. Total funding for education recovery in England now stands at £4.9 billion, or around £490 per pupil. That is considerably less than the Netherlands, say, where the figure is £2,100 per pupil. To truly make up for lost ground, the EPI suggests the Government will need to splash out another £8.6 billion.It is a sliding doors moment, with a generation’s education at stake. The consequences a bad start at school can have are clear: doing less well in exams, dropping out earlier, earning less, getting sicker and dying younger. “The pandemic has and will have a very considerable impact,” says Perera. “Time out of school has a long-term impact on employment outcomes as well as social and emotional health. We can’t say that they’ll never catch up, but what we do want is for the Government to acknowledge this and to provide more funding. The last thing we want to do is write this generation off.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: China faces consequences if it helps Russia, warns USTeach lessons on tackling misogyny in primary schools, says Sadiq KhanQueen\u0026#39s favourites out of Crufts dog parade after being \u0026#39on heat\u0026#39Ukrainians anxiously await news of the defenders of Snake Island, taken by Russia at the start of the conflictDVLA discriminating disabled drivers with long delays, MP warnsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ignore ofsted do best pupils government social mobility tsar","story":"Ignore Ofsted and do what is best for pupils, the Government\u0027s social mobility tsar has told headteachers.Katharine Birbalsingh, 49, said the inspecting body is “not a force for good” and urged teachers to “put the blinkers on” and “do what is right” for their children.  In a speech at the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) conference in Birmingham on Saturday, she said bureaucracy should be banned because “people spend too much time writing stuff down and not enough time doing it”.Before becoming chair of the Social Mobility Commission in October last year, the Oxford-educated reformer was known as ‘Britain’s strictest headteacher’ for her rules at Michaela Community School, where she is founder and headteacher.Rules at the mixed secondary school in Wembley include detentions for those who don’t bring a ruler to class and for speaking in corridors.  In 2021, 82 per cent of its A-level cohort were offered places at Russell Group universities.Worrying about OfstedDuring her 30-minute-long speech, Ms Birbalsingh, who was made a CBE in 2020, claimed she had once convinced an Ofsted inspector visiting her school that assiduously writing everything down is a waste of time.While conceding that Ofsted\u0027s chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, had done a “good job” so far and that the inspectorate is probably the “best it has ever been,” she added: “Too many of us understandably as leaders are constantly worried about what Ofsted is asking for.“You must try and just put the blinkers on and ignore it and just do what is right for your children and do what is right for your school…When the inspectors come you explain and you show.“If you have evidence for what you are doing and why you fight for that.”    In a Tweet in August 2021, she had called for Ofsted to be abolished claiming the damage it does to headteachers and other senior staff is “catastrophic”.In her speech, she said teachers should not be afraid to be disliked and should avoid “sentimentality” as having a backbone “is a mark of a good leader”.\u0027Believe in the children\u0027    She said: “Don’t be hurt if parents are upset with you or mean social media people – whoever it is that’s upset with you. You’ve got to believe in the children.”On smartphones, which Ms Birbalsingh claims hamper pupils\u0027 ability to learn, she recommended poorer children should not own them because it prevents them from being “socially mobile”.  As part of a digital detox initiative, pupils at Michaela are encouraged to give up their smartphones and video game console cables where they are housed in a safe for months at a time, she said.Roughly half of Year 11 students have voluntarily given their phones to staff to help them revise and many Year 7 and Year 8 pupils don’t own them at all.    In more challenging schools she would highly recommend a total silence policy because they can be horrible places where children get bullied.She added that pupils from poorer backgrounds who had not been explicitly taught material would see their middle-class peers answering questions and become demotivated.Speaking with toddlersWhat (the child) doesn\u0027t think at that moment is \u0027Well, I must be from a different socio-economic background, so that\u0027s why I couldn\u0027t answer.\u0027 What he thinks is, \u0027Gosh, I\u0027m dumb.\u0027 And then he starts poking Dave and poking John and keeps misbehaving, she said.Speaking on her role as chair of the Social Mobility Commission, she said not enough parents speak with their toddlers, an activity which improves their speech development.A 2014 study from Stanford University found that talking with infants and toddlers helped them grasp the rules and rhythms of language at an early age and provided them with a foundation to build up an understanding of how the world worked.Ms Birbalsingh has frequently criticised government bureaucracy, which she argues infringes on the autonomy and ability of schools.  Shortly after her appointment with the Social Mobility Commission, she said the body had frequently “wasted their time” writing reports that get “stuck on a website” that no one reads.  More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: China faces consequences if it helps Russia, warns USTeach lessons on tackling misogyny in primary schools, says Sadiq KhanQueen\u0026#39s favourites out of Crufts dog parade after being \u0026#39on heat\u0026#39Ukrainians anxiously await news of the defenders of Snake Island, taken by Russia at the start of the conflictDVLA discriminating disabled drivers with long delays, MP warnsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeons childish attention seeking proves scotland","story":"One senses that Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, misses the limelight she grabbed when Covid-19 was at its zenith.

But a no-fly zone could become a war between a nuclear-armed Nato and a nuclear-armed Russia: and no-one can so sure that the psychopath, sadist and narcissist who runs Russia would not launch such a weapon – unless, of course, he has taken Ms Sturgeon into his confidence.Normally, when Scotland’s First Minister says something absurd, her political opponents hesitate to take her on. Happily, this was not the Conservative Party’s response this time, as it realised the lethal consequences of her idiocy. Ministers are at last prepared to expose just how far out of her depth she is. Alister Jack, the Secretary of State for Scotland, was right to call her remarks “utterly irresponsible”. The Ministry of Defence has briefed the Scottish government regularly on the situation, yet what Ms Sturgeon suggested was at odds with what Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, Chief of the Defence Staff, had advised the Cabinet.There is a further paradox: although Ms Sturgeon seems willing to provoke the Third World War, she also wants to scrap the Trident missiles that would give the United Kingdom and her Nato allies a reasonable chance of avoiding the apocalypse. But because the Government at Westminster opposes a no-fly zone, for eminently sensible reasons, she seems to feel she has to call for one, just as during the pandemic she had to implement restrictions that began earlier, finished later, and were just that little bit more draconian. Like a spoilt child in a playground, she always has to be different, because in her ignorance she believes different is the same as better, and she has always to be better than the English oppressor.Similarly, as those she claims to represent struggle with increased energy bills, she opposes more drilling in the North Sea: frankly, if she really cared for their interests, she would sanction it tomorrow, and re-open some of Scotland’s coalmines too. Instead, her other concern last week was to apologise to the 4,000 or so people (about 15 per cent of whom were men) charged with Witchcraft under the Scottish Witchcraft Act of 1563, which she branded “injustice on a colossal scale”. She now advocates pardons for them, as she introduces an Orwellian law to make misogyny a criminal offence. Her only regret must be that the Act pre-dates the Act of Union, and all the great witch hunts also happened before 1707: otherwise one presumes the English taxpayer would be ordered to pay reparations.This desperate attention-seeking is another sign that peak Sturgeon has long passed: and it is harmless in that it diminishes only her and the fundamentally unserious cause of Scottish independence which she represents. And that cause will remain unserious so long as Ms Sturgeon and her acolytes act in such a petulant and irresponsible fashion.However, trying to pretend she understands international statesmanship is a more perilous activity, and one that shows her deeply unfit to lead. A period of silence, as Mr Attlee once put it, would be not only welcome, but perhaps life-saving. More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: China faces consequences if it helps Russia, warns USTeach lessons on tackling misogyny in primary schools, says Sadiq KhanQueen\u0026#39s favourites out of Crufts dog parade after being \u0026#39on heat\u0026#39Ukrainians anxiously await news of the defenders of Snake Island, taken by Russia at the start of the conflictDVLA discriminating disabled drivers with long delays, MP warnsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"10000 steps day may no longer key health later life","story":"Walking just 6,000 steps a day could reduce the risk of early death in people over 60, a study has found.Taking more than 8,000 steps, however, has no added benefit in reducing this risk, according to researchers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.The team analysed data from 15 studies which looked at the effect of daily steps on the mortality rate, from all causes of death, for nearly 50,000 people from four continents.The findings, published in the journal Lancet Public Health, show those under 60 should aim for between 8,000 and 10,000 steps a day.10,000 steps a day has no grounding in scienceDr Amanda Pauluch, co-author of the study, said the often quoted mantra of 10,000 steps a day had no grounding in science and came from a 1964 Japanese marketing campaign to sell pedometers.To find the right number, the team sorted the 47,471 adults from the studies into four groups based on their average daily steps.The lowest step group averaged 3,500 steps the second, 5,800 the third, 7,800 and the fourth, 10,900 steps.Among the three higher active groups who got more steps a day, there was 40 to 53 per cent lower risk of death, compared to the lowest quartile group who walked fewer steps.  In the over-60s the risk of premature death levelled off at about between 6,000 and 8,000 daily steps, with more steps having no added benefit.Walking speed had no definitive link with the reduction in risk, the team said.\u0027Moving even a little more is beneficial\u0027 Dr Paluchn said: Steps are very simple to track, and there is a rapid growth of fitness tracking devices.It\u0027s such a clear communication tool for public health messaging.The major takeaway is there\u0027s a lot of evidence suggesting that moving even a little more is beneficial, particularly for those who are doing very little activity.More steps per day are better for your health.An earlier study from last September, published in JAMA Network Open, found that walking 7,000 steps a day is enough to reduce the likelihood of  death in middle-age - 38 to 50 - by 72 per cent.Taking 10,000 steps a day, the target figure often touted by fitness experts, brought about a 55 per cent drop in risk.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: China faces consequences if it helps Russia, warns USTeach lessons on tackling misogyny in primary schools, says Sadiq KhanQueen\u0026#39s favourites out of Crufts dog parade after being \u0026#39on heat\u0026#39Ukrainians anxiously await news of the defenders of Snake Island, taken by Russia at the start of the conflictDVLA discriminating disabled drivers with long delays, MP warnsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"reintroducing wolves scotland 400 years would help control deer","story":"The reintroduction of wolves in Scotland after more than three centuries would help control deer numbers in the Highlands and mountains, according to new research.A paper from Manchester politan University’s department of natural sciences argued that the controversial move would “greatly reduce the current financial burden” of annual deer culls.The Highlands and Grampian mountains would be the best places to reintroduce wolves, it said, as large areas of remote terrain would mean they had ample food and low chances of contact with humans and vehicles.Although deer cause millions of pounds of damage to young trees, the study’s authors acknowledged that the impact on livestock farming and public opinion would have to be considered.Wolves are thought to have become extinct in Scotland in the late 17th century as a result of deforestation and being hunted by people wanting to protect their livestock.But Paul Lister, who became a multi-millionaire after inheriting his father’s MFI furniture business fortune, has previously outlined plans for a 50,000-acre reserve for two packs of wolves in Sutherland.Arguing the move would control deer numbers and help regenerate natural woodland, he has said the wolves would be in an “extensive enclosure” and closely monitored so “they won’t be roaming free, turning up in Inverness”.Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS) last year warned that deer numbers had doubled to almost a million since 1990 as it set out plans for a cull of female deer to tackle millions of pounds of damage to trees.Although SNP ministers have given the green light for the reintroduction of beavers north of the border, they have given no indication they plan to follow suit with wolves.Fergus Ewing, the then Rural Economy Minister, told farmers four years ago that wolves, bears or lynx would be reintroduced “over my dead body”.Francesca Osowska, chief executive of government agency NatureScot, also warned last year that demands to reintroduce predators threatened to seriously damage public support for rewilding the British countryside.‘Apex predators offer ecological benefits’But the paper, by Vashti Gwynn and Elias Symeonakis, argued that the absence of wolves had allowed deer populations to increase “beyond ecological sustainability”.They argued that wolf numbers have increased in mainland Europe, saying: “Evidence is growing that apex predators provide a range of ecological benefits, most stemming from the reduction of overgrazing by deer - something from which Scotland suffers.“Highlands and Grampian mountains emerge strongly and consistently as the most suitable areas for reintroduction.” The study has been submitted for peer review.The reintroduction of grey wolves to North America’s Yellowstone National Park in 1995 has been credited with improving species ersity and river hydrology.Previous studies have estimated that wolves being reintroduced in Scotland for 60 years would lead to deer densities tumbling to a sustainable level of seven per square kilometre. FLS said last year the latter figure was as high as 64 in some areas.But the Scottish Gamekeepers Association told the Sunday Times that Scotland’s fastest growing deer population is in the lowlands, particularly around urban areas.A spokesman for NatureScot said there were no plans to consider the reintroduction of wolves. He said: “Reintroduction projects are complex and need very careful consideration and planning to ensure national and international guidelines are met.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: China faces consequences if it helps Russia, warns USTeach lessons on tackling misogyny in primary schools, says Sadiq KhanQueen\u0026#39s favourites out of Crufts dog parade after being \u0026#39on heat\u0026#39Ukrainians anxiously await news of the defenders of Snake Island, taken by Russia at the start of the conflictDVLA discriminating disabled drivers with long delays, MP warnsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain must keep searching way","story":"Britain must keep searching for way to persuade – or force – Putin to withdrawNo one knows how this will end but that is no reason for our Government and others not to keep searching for a way to persuade – or force – Putin to withdraw, says the Voice of the MirrorThis is a war about one man’s vile and foolish quest to build an empire in his honour Image: Sputnik AFP via Getty ImagesopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Mar |commentsSpeaking for good people of all faiths and none, the Pope’s plea to “stop this massacre” in Ukraine should make invader Vladimir Putin think again and withdraw. It should, but it probably won’t. What is becoming increasingly clear is that the slaughter of innocent civilians by Putin’s military forces guarantees the Kremlin killer will go down in history as a reviled leader who wrecked his own country to destroy another. Because many more will die in a terrible conflict that is all about one man’s vile and foolish quest to build an empire in his honour. The bloodshed is escalating as the war runs out of control, with missiles hitting a base near the Polish border and the fatal shooting of award-winning US filmmaker Brent Renaud. No one knows how this will end but that is no reason for our Government and others not to keep searching for a way to persuade – or force – Putin to withdraw.  Visas shame The great generosity of the British people towards Ukrainian refugees is far more inspiring than Conservative ministers who had to be dragged kicking and screaming every step of the way. It is absolutely shaming that just , visas have been issued when over . million desperate Ukrainians have fled Putin’s terror.  While the bureaucrats continue to put up obstacles, millions are prepared to open their homes to those seeking sanctuary here. The Refugee Council’s concern over the level of support for war victims and Labour’s accusations of foot-dragging reveal the truth about the £-a-month Homes for Ukraine offer. Those arriving require sympathy and help, and genuine fears need to be addressed. Star power Putinaposs growing isolation was again underlined as stars expressed support for Ukraine at last night’s Baftas.

A new Labour analysis of ONS data today reveals companies based in the North East are twice as likely to make people jobless over the next three months, as employers scramble to cover the National Insurance rises. From April , workers, employers and the self-employed will all pay .p more in the pound for National Insurance contributions - from % to .% - as part of efforts to cut Covid backlogs in the NHS and social care.The hike comes as energy bills, rail fares, council tax and inflation are all on the rise, while income tax thresholds and childcare help are frozen and free Covid tests are set to be axed. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is under increasing pressure, from Labour and Tory backbenchers, to delay the hike in National Insurance, set to come in next month, as spiking inflation and rising energy prices hit the economy.  He is set to deliver his Spring Statement on March , with many hopeful the Treasury will announce further help for families as the Russia-Ukraine war looks set to prolong the cost of living crisis. Shadow Financial Secretary James Murray said: “The cost of living crisis has been spiralling since September, and people are worried about rising costs.“All the Chancellor is offering is a buy now, pay later loan on soaring energy bills – and their unfair National Insurance hike will make things even worse. “The fact that the North East is going to be hit harder once again underlines how it’s all talk and no action on levelling up from this government. “Businesses and the economy in the North East are crucial to our economic recovery – this is not the time to put yet another burden on them. “It’s time to get a grip. The Chancellor must halt the National Insurance hike before it’s too late, and look again at a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producers to cut home energy bills by up to £.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Labour PartyConservative PartyThe TreasurySpring StatementEnergy billsThe economyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The latest available data from the Department for Education shows % of children - or , pupils - had a reading ability below their expected ability at the end of Key Stage  in . The number of youngsters struggling at the end of primary school had increased, compared to % - or , pupils - the previous year. Official figures, revealed by Schools Minister Robin Walker in a written parliamentary question, show the figure rose to above % in some constituencies such as Leeds Central, Peterborough and Dudley North.Mr Walker said no data was recorded for academic years   or   due to the impact of the COVID- outbreak.The Liberal Democrats said the data laid bare the reading crisis in schools - and warned it could be the tip of the iceberg after children suffered major disruption to their schooling during the pandemic. MPs warned last week that poorer pupils could be up to eight months behind at school after the pandemic and the Governmentaposs catch-up plans are failing to reach them.The Commons Education Committee said repeated school closures had a disastrous impact on childrenaposs education, with disadvantaged kids worst hit by months out of the classroom. Lib Dem education spokesperson Munira Wilson said: These figures reveal a reading crisis in our schools and they’re just the tip of the iceberg. The pandemic has had a huge effect on our children, and with reading ages already below standards for many before the crisis, the case now could be terrible for thousands of children across the country.  “Parents, teachers and pupils have not had a fair deal throughout this pandemic, no child should leave primary school unable to read at the standard level for their age - they need a chance to catch up. The party called for an urgent review into reading standards across the country and for ministers to pump more cash into catch-up programmes. The Government has announced £ billion in funding to help children catch up on lost learning over the pandemic - which has been criticised for falling short of the £ billion demanded by Boris Johnsonaposs education recovery tsar Sir Kevan Collins. A Department for Education spokesperson said: We are committed to raising literacy standards and our ambitious recovery plan is helping pupils make up for learning lost during the pandemic. Backed by £ billion, we are rolling out high-quality tutoring – which has seen a million courses started by pupils so far – alongside world class training for teachers and early years practitioners, and additional funding for schools.

But in a humiliating show for his leader, Krishtop begged Ukrainians for forgiveness, admitting he had committed terrible crimes by fighting in Putinaposs war. Instead he described the Russian mission to capture Kyiv as pointless and urged his comrades to stop fighting. Lt Col Krishtop said: The invasion of such a huge city as Kyiv is pointless – it will lead to huge losses of le on both sides, and huge destruction. Follow the Russia Ukraine conflict live here with our live blog I urge you stop following criminal orders, stop fighting, and stop killing civilians – you can see we have already lost this war. But the conflict continues to be unrelenting with Russian troops now said to be driving west after wreaking havoc in the east. Satellite aposbefore and afterapos images of the port city of Mariupol show its luscious trees and beautul buildings flattened to a barren wasteland. Russian troops have been trying to seize it as a tactical move since the start of the conflict, in a bid to strangle the Ukraine economy by controlling key exports. The eastern city of Mykovail has also been encircled as Putinaposs forces are now said to be heading towards Odessa in the west.  President Zelensky urged Russian forces to comply with an agreed ceasefire so refugees could safely evacuate. But the Ukraine intelligence service claimed that these pleas were being ignored as it issued a statement that Russians had shot women and children fleeing for their lives. It said: Russians shot a column of women and children while trying to evacuate from the village of Peremoha in the Kyiv region along an agreed aposgreenapos corridor. After the attack, the occupiers forced the remnants of the column to turn back to Peremoha and are not letting them out of the village.Instead Russia has been using the opportunity to send in new troops, Ukraine claims.French President, Emmanuel Macron, said that President Putin was not willing to make peace. The claims followed a futile  minute phone call on Saturdaybetween France, Germanyaposs Olaf Scholz and the Russian aggressor, to find a way out of the war.

Another UK Space Agency project will develop technology that can withstand the high radiation levels on Mars. A third will build a communications tool for astronauts to tackle the delay in conversations between Mars and Earth. They are among  space projects getting a £million boost to help develop technology that could also have more down-to-earth benefits.  Announcing the cash to kick off British Science Week, science minister George Freeman said: “In addition to discovery breakthroughs, these projects will also ensure that people here on Earth benefit from new technology.” He said this included “micro-reactor technology with the potential to support our net zero commitments” on carbon in the fight against climate change. Abi Clayton of Rolls-Royce said: “This shows the true value of public and private partnership as we bring together the space domain experience of the UK Space Agency with our own unique nuclear expertise. “Together we can achieve ambitious technological firsts for the UK as we develop the power systems of the future.”  Among the Space Agency projects is a robot that will search for oxygen and water in moon rocks to save the need to carry the resources out to space to support those working there. The Mirror told last month how the European Space Agency had commissioned a machine to extract oxygen from moon rocks which could pave the way for a “lunar village” allowing further space travel. Extraction is possible thanks to a chemical process developed by UK firm Metalysis in Rotherham, South Yorks.

Itaposs a time when all members of the Royal Family come together to celebrate the Commonwealth and to honour the Queen - and the  event is set to take place tomorrow.The Covid- pandemic forced the event to be cancelled last year but the last service - held in  - was also the final royal engagement for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Weeks before the event, the pair made the bombshell announcement they would be quitting as senior royals and leaving the UK. For the service, Meghan memorably wore a vibrant green Emilia Wickstead cape dress that started blowing in the wind as she left the Abbey.And according to Christine Ross, the editor of the blog Meghanaposs Mirror, Meghan used the dress to send a secret but powerful message.She believes that it was a clear signal to the designer and to the people who claimed the two women had a complicated relationship.

Speaking previously on the Mirroraposs royal podcast Pod Save the Queen, she said: One of the most iconic looks is going to be her green Emilia Wickstead cape dress. That cape blowing in the wind as she walked into the church and then walked out of the church, which was such an emotional moment for so many people as it was their last formal engagement as royals. That green dress will stand out in history books I think.  She then went on to explain the complicated story between Meghan and Wickstead, which came from an interview the designer did with a magazine. Christine says that Wickstead described Meghanaposs wedding dress as simple, and taken out of context in other reports left many believing she was criticising the dress. She said: It was a pull quote from a larger interview, she really didnapost say anything negative.  People thought Emilia Wickstead had really wronged Meghan, and it turned out that Emilia Wickstead hadnapost wrong Meghan, it was a pull quote. Maybe a month or so later Meghan actually wore a custom Emilia Wickstead dress, and that situation shows the power of Meghanaposs fashion choices. She was able to say with this fashion choice, Emilia Wickstead and I are great. Weaposre on great terms, that whole thing was a huge misunderstanding and look at the lovely dress she designed for me. However, Meghan isnapost the only fan of Emilia Wicksteadaposs designs - her sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge has worn her pieces multiple times.Kateaposs most memorable looks include a stunning purple trouser suit she wore to Northern Ireland last year and a gorgeous blue dress she donned while meeting Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky and first lady Olena Zelenska at Buckingham Palace in .Meanwhile, another fan is Sophie Wessex, who has also worn Emilia Wickstead designs at Royal Ascot.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

According to figures from the Office For National Statistics, Covid infection levels in children were highest in those aged two years old to school year , at .%. Research by polling firm Findout now for the Mail on Sunday found that % were undecided and % said they would not get the jab for their child. Around half a million five to -year-oldshave been eligible for a jab since January but the rollout will open that up to six million more children.  Responding to the findings, GP and author Dr Philippa Kaye said: “I would strongly encourage parents to get their children vaccinated. “People are thinking about the risk of Covid, which thankfully is very mild in young children, but children are getting long Covid, which is a real concern. “Most commonly, that manests itself as fatigue but there are other symptoms too.We should not risk children missing more school because they are unwell.”An -year-old girl, Tillie from London, spoke to the BBC about the impact of long Covid after she was struck down by the virus back in December , leaving her in hospital for weeks and plunging in weight. Talking about her health now, Tillie from London said she feels sick “all the time”, has belly aches, leg aches, headaches and “pain in my eyes.”She said: “I used to love running about and going out but I don’t feel like doing that and I don’t feel like myself anymore.  “I hope I get better but you don’t really know because I always ask my mum when is it going to end and I always ask the doctors but they just don’t know, nobody knows and it makes me really upset because nobody knows.” An estimated , children aged under  in the UK are said to have suffered long Covid, according to the Office for National Statistics . Latest ONS figures also show covid infections are increasing across the UK, with about one in  people infected. The hardest-hit currently are those in Scotland, where , people - one in  - have coronavirus, the highest level recorded during the pandemic.The most common strain in the UK is thought to be a sub-iant of Omicron, called BA..Some scientists have blamed it on the increased transmissibility of this iant, the recent Government easing of restrictions including the legal requirement to self-isolate and the waning immunity from the vaccines could.Health Secretary Sajid Javid announced last month that immuno-compromised people, care home residents and anyone aged at least  would be offered a fourth dose of a vaccine in April.But experts have been calling this to be extended. Millions are enduring lockdowns again in China, where the virus started after the country sees the worst outbreak in two years.

Despite her devastation at the officer’s brutal killing just four weeks after the couple’s wedding, Lissie, , added she still hopes to find happiness. Describing the tragedy as “a blur of heart-wrenching pain”, she said: “We had gone from the happiest day of our lives to the worst in such a short space of time. “I don’t think I will ever fully come to terms with Andrew’s death, such an unexpected and shocking change to my le and the future we planned. “But I plan to be grateful for every moment and live how Andrew would want me to – to be happy and listen to my heart.” On Tuesday, ITV will screen documentary The Killing of PC Harper: A Widow’s Fight for Justice where Sir Trevor McDonald meets Lissie in her home in Wallingford, Oxon, to discuss the death.The officer, , was dragged along a road for more than a mile as he tried to stop a gang’s getaway car in August . Sir Trevor charts the probe that put the killers behind bars and talks to Lissie about her campaign for Harper’s Law. The initiative was launched after three teenagers accused of Andrew’s murder were instead found guilty of manslaughter. It aims to ensure anyone convicted of killing an emergency services worker while committing a crime is jailed for le. The measure has been included in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill to become law in the next few months. Lissie said: “I want to create something Andrew would be proud of. “Otherwise, it’s just a disgraceful waste of an amazing person’s le.  “There are no deterrents in our country for taking the lives of people who work tirelessly to protect the public. This needed to change.” Andrew was killed when he tackled Henry Long, , Albert Bowers, , and Jesse Cole, , as they towed a stolen quad bike along a Berkshire lane.The Thames Valley Police officer got entangled in a rope as they drove off but the gang said they did not know he was there. Colleagues initially mistook his body for a “bloodied deer carcass”. Andrew died at the scene. Long was jailed for  years while the others were caged for  years. Lissie recalled the cheering of the defendants’ families at the verdict as “a kick in the gut”. Admitting her grief is exhausting, she said of her campaign: “I will push, push until we get there, because I am doing it for Andrew, but I am also doing it for other emergency workers’ families, so in the future they won’t have to see this same kind of injustice.” The Killing of PC Harper: A Widow’s Fight for Justice will air on ITV, Tuesday night at pm Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DocumentariesMarriageLe sentenceCrimeBurglaryPC Andrew Harper\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But the announcement came just one day after he said he would not be attending Prince Phillip’s memorial service at Westminster on March . His lawyers said Prince Harry did not feel safe travelling to the UK after he was told he would no longer be afforded the “same degree” of personal protection when visiting from the US. The Duke of Sussex had previously cited the tragic death of his mother and the treatment of his we by the British press, as reasons why.  He offered to pay for the protection himself and is now locked in a legal battle with the Home Office. However, after his Invictus announcement, a source told The Sun: It was also hoped that the Queen would meet his daughter Lilibet for the first time and that would make it even more of a special occasion. Now none of that will go ahead - yet he is willing to travel to Holland for the Invictus Games, which is only -miles away. “It will certainly raise eyebrows and most probably hurt feelings.  The Royal Family has been going through a rough patch recently after Prince Andrew settled a civil sex abuse case by paying Virginia Giuffre £million despite insisting he’d never met her.A spokesperson added that Prince Harry hoped to visit the Queen “as soon as possible”.Since moving to America, Prince Harry has only been back to the UK twice, once for his grandfather’s funeral and one a second occasion for the unveiling of Princess Diana’s memorial. In the video by the Invictus Games Foundation, Prince Harry appears on a video call learning Dutch from four people. He says: One more time guys, please, you know I need to get this right, and I really want to get it right as well, so how do I say aposGood afternoon, youaposve done a great jobapos in Dutch   He is praised for his attempt at saying the sentence in Dutch, and then asks: And what , anything  I need to know  One of the people helping him says: Can you say stroopwafel  And he replies: Stroopwafel. Love those. Harry asks the people on the call: Do you think Iaposm ready  And he is told: We think youaposre ready. Speaking in Dutch, Harry says: Thank you. See you soon in The Hague.  Prince Harry is told to not forget his hat, at which point he dons an orange hat, orange sunglasses and unzips his jacket to reveal an orange T-shirt and stands up to show off orange trousers. Pointing at the camera, Harry says: Letaposs go. Weaposre ready. The tweet says: Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex, is getting ready for the Netherlands with some Dutch lessons.As we all prepare for The Games, our thoughts are with Team Ukraine, as well as their friends  family.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON WestminsterHome OfficePrince Andrew, Duke of YorkPrince HarryPrincess DianaFuneralsLoveRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Bank Tavern in the Bristol city centre has had to stop taking new bookings to clear the backlog caused by the Covid- pandemic. It has grown in popularity for its Sunday lunches as landlord Sam Gregory says we’ve created a massive rod for our back because of its popularity, BristolLive reports. Sam says heaposs had to switch off the pubaposs online reservation system for now to honour all the tables that were booked since the start of Covid and throughout the ious lockdowns and restrictions. He says heaposs only now seating tables that were booked in January  as the pub has always had a long waiting list.  Sam says: “It had got to a four-year waiting list until the pandemic but because we had a huge backlog of bookings for people who couldn’t eat here due to Covid or lockdowns, we made the decision to honour every booking. “We’ve actually closed off the booking system so you can’t book online andwe get any cancellations, we are simply back-filling with people in the diary from two years ago. We are up to January  now so it’s going to take a while to get through all the bookings.  A lot of the tables of two have been easy to rebook but it’s the larger tables of eight or ten which are taking a bit harder to fit in.” Sam says to speed up the rebookings, the pub now runs an extra fourth sitting on Sundays, from pm to pm. He says that the pub does still suffer from the occasional no show even after sending reminder emails and phone calls.  Sam recommends people still check out the pub on Sundays in case a table is available last minute. He said: We always say to peopleyou are in town, stick your head around the door because sometimes tables come upwe get no-shows. It’s always worth checking just in case.” Sam says it is consistency that has led to the continued success of the pubaposs Sunday roasts as well as the attention to detail. He added: We stick to the same meats all year round but add seasonal alternatives like lamb and venison, but our starters and desserts change every week. A lot of places doing Sunday roasts only release bookings for three-month slots andwe knew we were going to be this popular, we would have done that but it’s a nice problem to have!” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Pubs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Palace did not give a specic reason for her planned absence from the event.The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester have also cancelled their attendance because the duke has tested positive for COVID-.Itaposs thought the Queen may never be well enough to walk them again, The Sun reports.A palace source said: “She is not well enough. “The Queen usually turns to her beloved corgis in time of crisis and stress and took them out almost every day after Philip fell ill and then died last year. They are an enormous source of solace, so it is a real shame.” The Queen has always found solace in her loyal pet pooches, particularly in the aftermath of the death of her husband Prince Philip in April last year In her absence, palace aides now take her two corgis and dorgi out for their daily exercise, sources claim.A senior royal source said: “Dogs remain very much part of Windsor le.” It comes after the Queen cancelled an appearance at Monday’s annual Commonwealth Day service after suffering problems with her mobility. The -year-old monarch is understood to be experiencing increasing discomfort when it comes to getting about. Her Majesty will instead be represented by the Prince of Wales, Buckingham Palace said.  The head of state, who has recently recovered from a bout of Covid, hoped to join Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the Commonwealth event. The ­decision is not linked to any illness but is related to the Queen’s comfort of getting to and from the service. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The Queen has asked the Prince of Wales to represent Her Majesty at the Commonwealth service at Westminster Abbey.” The service would have been the Queen’s first major public appearance since reaching her Platinum Jubilee milestone, and the first Commonwealth Day service held in full since .Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine, said she believed the Queen would be “determined” to make the Thanksgiving service at Westminster Abbey dedicated to her late husband Prince Philip on March .Ms Seward said: “It would have been a huge wrench to miss the Commonwealth Day service but she is facing a dilemma these days where she must choose her engagements wisely. She will be very determined to make the Duke of Edinburgh’s Thanksgiving service later this month, which will be of incredible importance to her considering his funeral was so scaled back. “Her Majesty, I believe, is very like her mother, who was reluctant to use a wheelchair, so in her advancing years it’s about projecting herself as much as possible for the big occasions. The Queen tested positive for Covid on February  and Buckingham Palace said at the time she was experiencing “mild cold-like symptoms”. Last month, she acknowledged her frail condition for the first time during a royal engagement at Windsor Castle. The Queen told visiting military officials: “As you can see, I can’t move.” She last met a group of people in public on February .

And now she is set to be told to take it easy in the coming days and weeks before the memorial service for her late beloved husband at the same venue on March .She is hoping to be able to attend the event with her walking stick and has ruled out using a wheelchair. An insider told The Sun: “You can’t say she will definitely be at the service but there’s an element of pacing herself to make it happen.” Senior royal aides are understood to have accepted that the “frailties that come with living a long le” are finally catching up with her.It is being reported that her aides said the Queen was so frail she is unable to even walk her beloved corgis.

Her Majesty is hoping to be able to attend the event with her walking stick at Westminster Abbey on March .But this comes after she was announced not fit enough to attend Mondayaposs Commonwealth Service at the same venue.Buckingham Palace did not give a specic reason for her planned absence from the event.It is being reported that her aides said the Queen was so frail she is unable to even walk her beloved corgis.Queen Elizabeth II has owned more than  corgis in her letime but she has not taken her dogs for a walk at Windsor Castle for six months. Now The Mail on Sunday understands she has ruled out the option of using a wheelchair at this stage and remains determined to continue to walk for as long as possible.The Queen, who turns  next month and has recently recovered from Covid, was last week moving around Windsor Castle without a walking stick and is not suffering from a new illness. But she still made the “regretful” decision late on Friday to pull out of the annual Commonwealth Service, which is usually a highlight in her calendar.  A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The Queen has asked the Prince of Wales to represent Her Majesty at the Commonwealth service at Westminster Abbey.” Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine, said she believed the Queen would be “determined” to make the Thanksgiving service at Westminster Abbey dedicated to her late husband Prince Philip on March . Ms Seward said: “It would have been a huge wrench to miss the Commonwealth Day service but she is facing a dilemma these days where she must choose her engagements wisely.  She will be very determined to make the Duke of Edinburgh’s Thanksgiving service later this month, which will be of incredible importance to her considering his funeral was so scaled back. “Her Majesty, I believe, is very like her mother, who was reluctant to use a wheelchair, so in her advancing years it’s about projecting herself as much as possible for the big occasions. The Queen tested positive for Covid on February  and Buckingham Palace said at the time she was experiencing “mild cold-like symptoms”.  Last month, she acknowledged her frail condition for the first time during a royal engagement at Windsor Castle. The Queen told visiting military officials: “As you can see, I can’t move.” She last met a group of people in public on February .

Thomas Markle said he would be “thrilled” to come face-to-face with his estranged daughter and her husband Prince Harry. He said he believed his eldest daughter should win her case and revealed he would be willing to give evidence on her behalf. He added: “I would be more than happy to. I’ve been trying for almost four years to get to see my daughter and her ginger husband in a courtroom face-to-face.  “I’d be thrilled to defend my oldest daughter.” Mr Markle also added that he believed Meghan, , should settle the case, saying: “She can’t defend the things she said.” Mr and Karl Larsen have been inspired by straight-talking royal author Lady Colin Campbell and US podcast king Joe Rogan to start their new YouTube channel. They plan to broadcast their views on current affairs - which will no doubt include Meghan and Harry - every week.  Mr Markle confirmed: We have discovered YouTube... weaposve decided to join and share our story. Samantha, , is suing her half-sister Meghan for , , claiming she lied about her to the authors of controversial book Finding Freedom and in her TV interview with Oprah Winfrey. The lawsuit was first revealed by the Sunday Mirror in November and was formally lodged in Florida last week. Speaking in the debut episode, Thomas says: Iaposm standing up for my oldest daughter, Samantha. In this case, she should win because Meghanaposs book was full of lies about her. I would appear in a deposition in this case,it came to it.  Michael Kump, representing Meghan, called the lawsuit baseless and absurd and a continuation of a pattern of disturbing behaviour. He added: We will give [the lawsuit] the minimum attention necessary, which is all it deserves. In November, Meghan apologised to the Court of Appeal after emails contradicting a claim she did not collaborate with Finding Freedom authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand were disclosed. The messages, revealed by Meghanaposs ex-communications secretary Jason Knauf, showed she sent details about Samantha and brother Thomas Jr to pass on for the book. But Meghan insisted: I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the defendant or the court.  Speaking about the motivation behind the podcast, Mr Markleaposs co-host Karl, , said: Tom wants to do it to put his thoughts out there from the horseaposs mouth. “He wants to speak about how Meghan and Harry have affected his family. The chat will be no-holds-barred. He wants his truth to be out there, just like Meghanaposs truth came out a year ago in her Oprah Winfrey interview. He also wants to speak about other things in the news, too. Karl - an LA-based photographer who grew up in Winchester, Hants - added: Weaposre thinking of referring to ourselves as aposthe yapper and the snapperapos in future. It sounds more catchy than Tom and Karl. The first episode went online on Sunday and also featured Mr Markle telling Karl that he was surprised Prince Harry didnapost fly out to see him in person to ask for Meghanaposs hand in marriage. He added: “I thought the Royals had some kind of sense of dignity where he would have taken the time to fly down and see me.” Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON YouTubeMeghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal FamilyThomas Markle Snr\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Weather forecaster Jim Dale told the Express that Brits can look forward to hot weather arriving fairly early this year. April temperatures in the UK usually reach a daily high of around C and a low of C - but the high this year could reach a scorching C, Daily Star reports.The forecaster said such spikes in temperature are becoming more likely as a result of global warming. He said: I think hot weather could come in fairly early as far as April is concerned perhaps.  I know March is the start of Spring but I think weaposre probably going to get properly into April before we start to see the searing sort of temperatures. I wouldnapost be surprised to see C, C, C in the middle of April. Dale added: Longer-term, given whataposs happening globally in terms of the temperature profiles in the southern hemisphere and whataposs also happening in the United States, I would not be surprisedwe started to see some big highlights - in whichever direction it goes, either cold or hot. It is more likely that we see those spikes of heat at early stages because of global warming. Itaposs too dficult to be certain at this moment, but I would not be surprised to see the summer deliver the same kind of heat stress at times. This comes as the Met Office issued yellow weather warnings for strong winds on Sunday.  Gusts are expected to track up the Irish Sea, and winds may reach  to mph along coastal areas. These are expected to travel northwards throughout Sunday. There is a small chance of winds exceeding mph, possibly reaching severe gales along more exposed coastal regions with winds reaching mph. This may lead to some poor coastal conditions and transport disruption.  UK  day weather forecastToday: Band of rain continuing north and east, becoming slow moving across parts of east and southeast England later. Sunshine and showers, heavy in places with hail and thunder, following across western areas. Gales in western areas easing through the afternoon. Tonight: Rain in east clearing. Showers near southern coasts,  clear spells inland allowing frost and patchy fog to form. Cloudier further north with outbreaks of rain in the northwest. Monday: Outbreaks of rain across the northwest moving east across northern areas and turning more showery. Sunny spells further south, with a few heavy showers developing. Outlook for Tuesday to Thursday: Rain across the far northwest on Tuesday will spread across many areas during Wednesday, before clearing to leave largely dry, fine, and sunny conditions by Thursday.

This is about a two per cent increase in the UK - and a four per cent increase in the capital. The prices went up at the beginning of the month.A Wetherspoons spokesperson told Somerset Live : Occasionally Wetherspoon does increase the price of its drinks. We always aim to keep our prices as competitive as possible. Prices on drinks in the majority of our pubs have increased by an average p from Tuesday March , with an increase of p in pubs in and around London. This represents an average two per cent increase in the majority of Wetherspoon pubs and four per cent in pubs in and around London. We believe that our drinks offer still represents great value-for-money. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.

It is still cheaper than anywhere  around, but it did mean I had to get my card out for the second pint. It didnapost ruin my evening, but it was something I wasnapost expecting. Thehas contacted Wetherspoons for a comment.It comes as Wetherspoons has stopped selling Russian beer following the countryaposs invasion of Ukraine. The much-loved pub chain has said bottles of Baltika Lager - which is brewed in St Petersburg, the birthplace of Vladimir Putin - has been axed for its  boozers.All bottles of the Russian beer - which cost £. - will be ed to distributor Carlsberg.Wetherspoons said: In light of the situation in Ukraine we just felt that we could not stock it anymore. As of today all those beers wonapost be available in any Wetherspoons pub and either have been or are in the process of being ed to the Carlsberg distributor. We are not implying in any way that anyone involved with the brewery is directly involved with whataposs going on but we thought in light of the current situation our pubs donapost want to be serving Russian beers.c Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON JD WetherspoonVladimir PutinFitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Samantha, , is suing her half-sister Meghan for , , claiming she lied about her to the authors of controversial book Finding Freedom and in her TV interview with Oprah Winfrey. Speaking in the debut episode, Thomas says: “I’m standing up for my oldest daughter, Samantha. In this case, she should win because Meghan’s book was full of lies about her. I would appear in a deposition in this case,it came to it.”Michael Kump, representing Meghan, called the lawsuit “baseless and absurd” and a “continuation of a pattern of disturbing behaviour”. He added: “We will give [the lawsuit] the minimum attention necessary, which is all it deserves.” In November, Meghan apologised to the Court of Appeal after emails contradicting a claim she did not collaborate with Finding Freedom authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand were disclosed. The messages, revealed by Meghan’s ex-communications secretary Jason Knauf, showed she sent details about Samantha and brother Thomas Jr to pass on for the book. But Meghan insisted: “I had absolutely no wish or intention to mislead the defendant or the court.”  Speaking about the motivation behind the podcast, Thomas’s co-host Karl, , said: “Tom wants to do it to put his thoughts out there from the horse’s mouth. He wants to speak about how Meghan and Harry have affected his family. The chat will be no-holds-barred. “He wants his truth to be out there, just like Meghan’s truth came out a year ago in her Oprah Winfrey interview.  “He also wants to speak about other things in the news, too.” Karl – an LA-based photographer who grew up in Winchester, Hants – added: “We’re thinking of referring to ourselves as ‘the yapper and the snapper’ in future. It sounds more catchy than Tom and Karl.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince HarryMeghan MarkleYouTubeRoyal FamilySunday Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old has a strict no single mumspolicy when it comes to dating, as he believes it makes it impossible to be spontaneous when making plans, as children always need to be considered.About four months ago, the man went round to his friendaposs house to watch some sports, and while he was there, his friendaposs girlfriend invited one of her friends round - a woman called Morgan.Me and Morgan had an immediate connection. She was really cute and had a good personality so I was interested. I asked my friends girlfriend to set me up and she did, he wrote on Redditaposs AITA forum. I got Morganaposs contact info and we started texting. During the conversation I askedshe had any kids and she said no. Perfect, because I donapost date single mums. Iaposve had issues with it in the past and itaposs just not something Iaposm comfortable doing anymore. I told her this and she said she understood.Since then, he and Morgan have done on five dates together, and on each one of them theyaposve had a really good time and have laughed a lot. After their fth date, the man decided to look Morgan up on Facebook to add her as a friend, as he saw the relationship blossoming into something, but he was shocked when he saw her page.She had a kid on her profile. I thought maybe it was a nephew. But kept scrolling and found more pics. Definitely her kid. So I texted and asked sheshe had a kid. She said, aposwhy are you asking apos I told her about the Facebook. She then admitted to having a kid. She said she didn’t like to bring him up until she knew she could trust a guy. And that she’s at the point now where she trust me.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. The man told her thought that was bulls*** because she knew his stance on dating single mums, leaving him feeling like sheaposd wasted his time. He went on to ask that she send him the money for tickets they had bought for an upcoming gig, as heaposd spent around £on all their dates so far. I wasnapost gonna Venmo request her for all the dates, as I make good money and didnapost feel the need to do that, but I did Venmo request her for one of the tickets and £for the dates, around £total, he explained. I guess Morgan told my friendaposs girlfriend because she texted me, Saying that Iaposm being an a**hole, but my friend is defending me saying that I shouldnapost have been lied to, and paying £ is nothing compared to the hundreds I spent on dates. And she still has the ticket. The man then turned to Reddit to question whether he really was in the wrong for asking for the money back after Morgan knowingly lied to him about having a child. I can see requesting the ticket back and reselling it. The rest Iaposd write off and move on. In the future, probably best to just split the cost of dates, one Reddit user suggested. Another added: Sheaposs sucks for lying but bro just let it go and move on. Itaposs . Not worth the energy to try to retrieve it, nor is it a good look.

In June , the -year-old, from Florida, was forced to shut down her two businesses due to the pandemic, which led to her change in career.Speaking to the Daily Star, Sara - who lives in Florida with her husband and children - spoke about how her le has changed since turning to OnlyFans. I started doing OnlyFans in June of . Before OnlyFans I was a salon owner. I had a salon in Tennessee and Kansas, both of which were recognised as award winning salons in both states, she told the publication. I started during the pandemic after becoming viral on TikTok and having my followers ask meI had one.Saraaposs account quickly gained traction, with many of her , Instagram followers rushing to sign up as monthly paying subscribers, generating huge income.When I started I was averaging £,a month and it’s just gone up from there, she said, before going on to say how sheaposs using the money to fund a better lestyle for her children.I just bought a miniature farm with six acres, a barn, and stables. I drive a Ford Expedition and have a  Mustang . that I race, Sara continued. Of course I would love to blow money on getting a Bentley Continental GT but I’m more interested in giving my family a good le and making modest decisions with my earnings. However, as an OnlyFans model, Sara finds her family have been affected by her career – mostly because of judgemental fellow parents. She explained: They’ve experienced the bad of it with their cheerleading and football league banning their mum from being there and kicking them off the team as well. But they also see the respect I get from people in the sports and entertainment industry. I would get judged by other parentsI wasn’t doing OnlyFans, I dress sexier than other mums, I didn’t sign the PTO dress code, and I never will.

But, despite her children being young, and some people’s negative attitudes, Sara doesn’t hide who she is from her kids.Sara told us: I have four kids who are still very young. Aside from doing OnlyFans I have a huge following on TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter. I do sports predictions for Egotastic and write for ProSports Extra, they watch my predictions and see my TikToks.They have been with me when I’m approached or when people in public recognise me. I share interviews that I’ve done with them as well. In order for them to understand we have opportunities to experience things because of what their mum does, I want them to be appreciative and understand it’s work. My son will go to my trainer with me, I want them to see how much I put into this. Despite any downsides, Sara insists she’s found her dream career. The mum commented: I love being an OnlyFans model because I can really connect with my following. We talk sports, sex, work, and relationships. I feel like since I do this all on my own, I’m building personal relationships with my subscribers and it’s really intimate. Being sexy, loving to have sex, and wear bikinis or lingerie is a dream come true job.

While one of her neighbours has children of her own and is super supportive, the woman living in the flat next to hers isnapost so kind - and has even threatened to lodge noise complaints with the police. The mum, from the UK, said: I had my son seven weeks ago. Heaposs really sick due to multiple allergens, and weaposre still trying to figure out some of them. The majority of my time is spent trying to soothe him while heaposs in pain. So, basically, he cries. A lot. We live in an apartment complex, and so our neighbours hear him a lot. Itaposs a given - cheap apartment, paper-thin walls. On one side I have a single mother with three kids. Sheaposs understanding and super supportive, often offers to babysit so I can sleep.  On the other side, I have a young woman who is much less understanding. Every day she will bang on the door to complain, and sheaposs even called the police twice before they had a chat with her. She insinuated she would call social services over it, although not sureshe ever did. The mum insisted sheaposs tried talking to her neighbour about why her son cries so much, and while she understands that itaposs disruptive, thereaposs nothing she can do to make it stop. But after the womanaposs actions escalated and she started banging on the walls, the mum took matters into her own hands - and gted her a pair of earplugs to get her to stop bullying her.  She added: Iaposve tried to explain that babies cry, and even ulged his medical issues a bit. I get where sheaposs coming from - he screams all day and all night. Itaposs disruptive. But I canapost make him stop, so thereaposs really no use giving me s**t over it. Anyway, sheaposs been getting persistent recently - blaring music when heaposs sleepingand banging on the walls and things. Three days ago I bought earplugs, knocked on her door and gave them to her, with the comment of, aposUse these and stop bullying a sick child and his struggling mother.apos She was shocked, I walked back into my apartment. The mum has since heard minimal banging from her neighbour, but feels really guilty about the way she handled things. Commenters on the Reddit post were split though, as most people could see how the situation would negatively impact both sides of the argument. One said: Man I feel you, itaposs a baby - but the neighbour has a point too. Itaposs not her baby, her sleep is constantly getting interrupted and she must be sleep-deprived. As another added: New mum here. I get that you can’t control your baby. You can’t always get them to stop crying. I get it. But I also get how annoying it is to have to listen to a baby that you didn’t sign up for.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON RedditBabiesNewborn babyParentingNeighbours from hell\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But when her sister came to collect them that evening, she was furious that her sister would dare leave her babies with a stranger. She added: I picked the kids up from daycare since my sister wasnapost answering her phone, and fed them. She picked them up at around  pm and was absolutely livid that I left them with a stranger, that it was irresponsible, that something could have happened, etc. I told her that she knew I couldnapost babysit that day and that she could have picked them upshe wasnapost comfortable with that since I texted the address. She told me I should have just skipped the exam to retake it later. I thought this was a reasonable thing to do when someone leaves kids on your doorstep without warning and you canapost take care of them, but my parents are on her side. My mum told me my sister already has so much on her plate, and that I should help out when I can. I guess babysitting at least one day a week for free isnapost good enough. Commenters on the Reddit post were firmly on the womanaposs side, as many of them said she isnapost obligated to drop her university commitments to look after her sisteraposs children at a momentaposs notice.

The hauntings reputedly became so frightening Bolton Council was forced to intervene, but staff couldnapost find a rational explanation for what was going on. At one stage an exorcism was carried out, and all paranormal activity on the street is now thought to have ceased. Even so, years after the last ghostly goings-on, one resident was still made to sign a disclaimer form before moving into her home. It all started in  when one family started experiencing bizarre activity. It was said that their toddler would talk to a ‘little man’ in his room and an oil-type substance would run down the walls.  The incidents reportedly baffled maintenance workers who could not determine the cause of the issues. The family eventually contacted a local church and an exorcism was carried out at the address. Following the ritual, the street fell quiet. But, just five years later in , a flurry of supernatural activity would begin again. Just two doors down from the original haunted house, a family started experiencing strange disturbances. They had not long moved into the address when the unexplained activity began. Laura was -years-old when she moved into the property. The now -year-old said she aposknewapos something was wrong with the home as soon as the family arrived.  Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, she said: “I begged my mum not to move in. “I didn’t like the feel of it. I didn’t feel comfortable but when we got our stuff in, it faded a bit. “When things started happening, my mum would say it was the ghost of my granddad. But I said it wasn’t. “I just knew there was something there. It felt like I was walking into someone’s personal space. “I didn’t want to walk through the door.” Laura remembers the first supernatural occurrence like it was yesterday. She was with her older brother and a friend when the incident happened. The siblings decided to play a prank on their pal who was sleeping in the living room.  As they ran back upstairs, her brother let out a blood-curdling scream. He had cut his foot open on a picture frame that was standing on the staircase. It had been hanging on the wall just moments before and had not fallen down. “We had literally just walked on the stairs andit fell it wouldn’t stand up,” Laura continued. “If he stood on it, it would have slipped. It was like a force was holding it in place. “That was one of the first scary things that happened.” Laura also recalls the time her brother’s girlfriend came round to stay. She woke in the middle of the night to find her standing in her room, staring at her as she slept. Laura ignored her and went back to sleep.  The following morning, she told her mother about the strange occurrence. Thinking nothing of it, Laura ed to her bedroom. But her mother called her downstairs just  minutes later, where she found her brother’s girlfriend “looking at her weirdly”. “She said I did the exact same thing to her,” she continued. “We got up at dferent times.” Strange activity wouldn’t just occur inside the home. Dozens of dead crows were once found scattered around the front and back garden, including along the ginnel at the side of the property. Laura said the sight traumatised her so badly she blocked it out of her mind. And then there was the baby oil-type substance, similar to that found in the original haunted house. Laura remembers it dripping down her bedroom walls, causing her posters to fall down. A foul, sulphur smell likened to rotting eggs would also fill the property. Laura says some council maintenance workers even refused to visit the address due to its reputation. “My nephew used to speak to someone and called them ‘Big Guy’,” she continued. “He would sit there in the corner of the room babbling away. “When asked who he was talking to, he would say Big Guy. “He kept doing it in the same place and would point right up to the corner.” Laura also recalls the time she heard an entity imitate her brother. She was at home with a friend waiting for her sibling tofrom work. They were ready to watch a new episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a show her brother didn’t want to miss out on. She heard the door open, a set of keys placed on the hook and footsteps into the kitchen. When her brother still hadn’t come upstairs  minutes later, she thought he may have been making food. But suddenly, her brother walked through the door. Laura said: “As I got to the top of the stairs, I saw him. “I asked himhe had just gone back out. “He said he had literally just got home and his taxi was driving off. “I ran downstairs and said someone was in the house. But no one was in the kitchen and the keys were still in the door. “We heard it it was really clear. We knew the sound of it.” Laura eventually moved out of the home when she was -years-old. And although she hasn’t experienced anything paranormal since, what occurred on Wingates Grove continues to haunt her to do this day. “I donapost watch any scary films or anything to do with ghosts,” Laura added. “I’ve suffered with anxiety since to the point where the whole thing about the street is on my doctor’s note. “The last five months we lived there I slept in a bed with my mum and dad because I was that scared. “That’s when things got really bad. “I kept seeing people stood at the door. I fell asleep facing my wall because I was terried of turning over. “If I needed to go to the toilet in the night, I would hold it in.” These days, there are no reports of ghostly activity on the street. Caron Walton, who now lives in Lauraaposs childhood home, says she has ’no problem’ with the property’s history – and actually enjoys its quirky past. She purchased the home in  and says she had to sign a disclaimer before she moved into the address. It specied that she was not allowed to use a Ouija board or perform any other type of black magic at the address, she says. She was also told she was not allowed to move into the homeshe had young children, she told the M.E.N. “I understand there was something going on there,” she said. “It used to jump from there, to the house next door to here. “I had to sign a disclaimer saying I wouldn’t use a Ouija board or do black magic or anything dark. “They wanted me to sign a slip of paper. I quite liked it. “I’ve heard tales that there’s meant to be an old man walking around on the landing, but we’re quite happy here. “I think it’s quite novel I quite like it. It’s a selling point for me.” Caron hasnapost experienced any supernatural activity since moving into the address. “They wanted someone to move here who didn’t have very young children. “I’ve had no issues I thought it was quite quirky. “A lot of council workers wouldnapost come here. I’ve not felt anything since living here. “I’ve had pets, like dogs, and they’ve never been freaked out. “I’m open to it I’m not a disbeliever.

Bed-ridden Danny Hodgson can be seen hooked up to hospital machines while gripping onto a stress ball in the video, as his family gently tap him on his arm and legs. The -year-old suffered a fractured skull and brain haemorrhage following a single punch blow at Perth train station on September , last year. Doctors then put the ex-Carlisle United youth player, from Cleaton Moor in Cumbria, in a medically induced coma as they struggled to treat bleeds on his brain and blood clots. His parents Nicola and Peter flew out to be at his bedside during the intervening months and asked the public to “pray” and send “positive thoughts” for his recovery.  And over six months later, the new footage confirms that he is making steady progress following the alleged horric, unprovoked assault. Nicola had earlier praised doctors treating her son at Royal Perth Hospital before he moved into the next stage of his rehabilitation. She said: Despite his signicant injuries, Danny spent every minute of those  days in Royal Perth fighting. He never gave up and the ICU doctors nicknamed him aposIronmanapos. We are eternally grateful for the medical staff in ICU and the Trauma Unit who helped save Danny.”In January, surgeons had also undertaken an especially risky operation to reattach a part of his skull, which had been removed last year to relieve pressure on his brain. But the mum had later confirmed, to her great relief, that this had been a success. Danny had moved out to Australia when he was , where he played for National Premier Leagues Western Australia side ECU Joondalup. He had been out with his teammates before the incident, celebrating a successful end to the season. But at around am on September , he was allegedly punched in the back of the head by a -year-old teenager, who can’t be named for legal reasons.  Australian police later arrested the boy and charged him with aggravated battery. The unnamed boy is due to appear in court this week. Dannyaposs parents earlier confirmed that this stage of their son’s extensive recovery would involve him learning to consume foods and talk once again. They said: He must learn to swallow, drink, eat and eventually talk again and that is just the beginning. His physical rehabilitation will be gruelling, and we know that for every tiny step forward there is likely to be setbacks. But we believe in Danny’s strong spirit and with the support of his wonderful girlfriend Jess, his family, and his friends, we know he can slowly and painstakingly move forward.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON HospitalsTeenagersStress\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Things are dferent now. With Western sanctions driving out hundreds of major international companies, there’s a sense of desperation in the air. In the upmarket Gagarinskiy shopping mall nearby, there has been a dash for everything from fast food to imported clothing before shops are shuttered up for good - or their rapidly depreciating roubles can no longer buy them. And even in the supermarkets, shelves have been stripped of essentials like pasta and rice, as locals fear shortages and rationing could soon be on the cards.  “They don’t have anything I need,” said one anxious resident, who had called into the Auchan supermarket on her way home from work. “And everything that’s left is really overpriced.”With the ruble halving in value over the past fortnight Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the bill for families’ weekly shop has skyrocketed.Darina, an interpreter living in the Russian capital, told me that she was struggling to afford to feed her pet after costs virtually doubled overnight. She said: “It was  rubles yesterday online, now it’s , - they’re raising the prices every minute. Now my cat is eating more expensive food than I am. Videos shared online of people stockpiling essentials have added to the sense of panic here.In one, a man in the city of Nizhny Novgorod can be seen filling the boot of his car with hundreds of bags of sugar. “Whether he was trying to play it safe or turn a profit is unknown,” one state media network observed disapprovingly. Shoppers have also been sweeping up items that just a few weeks ago it would have been unthinkable to do without, like bottles of Coca-Cola. Moscow-based IT expert Ilya said: “Even in the Soviet Union, they had Coke. Soon no Western brands will be left. You don’t notice how important these things are until you can’t get them anymore.” Meanwhile, Moscovites have descended on McDonald’s restaurants this weekend, knowing all  branches of the chain will be shuttered indefinitely from Monday morning. Irina, a worker at McDonald’s in Moscow’s Yerevan Plaza said. “It’s been ridiculously busy here. We haven’t been told anything by the manager, but people are saying we’ll be sent home on full pay for now.” Nika, a -year old trainee government official, said she had come down to get a meal before her local branch closes. “I’m going to miss getting a burger and fries - but I’m trying to enjoy the small things while they last. I don’t understand why all these companies are abandoning us - does our money not matter anymore ”Pictures shared on Telegram, one of the few social sites not yet being blocked, show people stocking their fridges with McDonald’s burgers and taking home piles of cheese sauce - a special menu item only available in Russia.Other brands, including Starbucks and Burger King, have also said they will cease trading in the country in response to Western sanctions.  Vyacheslav, a student working part-time at KFC in Moscow told me: “Right now we’re just waiting but people are worried about losing their jobs. People have families, they need to pay taxes. It’s not fair that ordinary Russians are being punished for this when it’s not our fault - I need to work too.” The southern fried chicken shop announced it will close its doors last week. Masha, a -year old office worker in the Russian capital says she and many of her friends are doing what they can to move abroad.She said:Netflix and Spoty aren’t working, protesters are being arrested in the street and they’re saying soon we won’t even be able to buy Coke Zero.I guess I should get as much as I can now.” For others, however, the squeeze of sanctions has put them on the defensive. It’s common to see the pro-war ‘Z’ logo painted on cars, trucks and buses, or emblazoned on people’s T-shirts. Last week the chairman of a cancer charity in the city of Tazan got a group of terminally-ill children and their mothers to line up in a giant ‘Z’ in the snow, proudly posting the drone photo on the hospice’s website.  At the weekend two slickly produced videos also appeared on social media channels of hundreds of flat-waving Russians, all wearing identical black sweatshirts emblazoned with a white ‘Z’. And not everyone is complaining about the Western exodus from Russia.

Toddlers sit compliantly, cajoled by carers doing their best to maintain some calm amid the madness.The sad scene in Kyiv is echoed in  children’s homes housing , orphans, half of them disabled. Food and water is running out. Staff numbers are hit as , seek sanctuary with their own families. Carers say they rush the kids to safety below ground by announcing “Children – explosions”. They also tell them to eat every scrap on their plates – unable to guarantee when the next meal will be. Just , orphans have been evacuated – with the British charity Hope and Homes for Children helping  to safety in Dnipro and Vorzel. Relentless shelling means it is too perilous to move the youngsters in the picture above. Today, the Sunday Mirror launches an urgent Orphan Appeal to send out supplies. Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here Labour leader Keir Starmer, ex-forces chief Lord Dannatt and Bond actress Olga Kurylenko – who has Ukrainian, Russian and Belarusian ancestry – are backing our campaign. shockHope and Homes rescued  children, including two babies and two with disabilities, from Dnipro, in central Ukraine. Another  from Vorzel, near the capital, were bussed away when their orphanage was hit by an illegal Russian cluster bomb. Mercully there were no casualties. In Dnipro, Hope and Home aide Daria, , explained how the horror unfolded there. She said: “When the first rockets fell it was a massive shock. We said, ‘Children, today your le changes. Rockets could fly in at any moment, soldiers could walk through the door’. “We started to very quickly instruct them how we should go down to the basement during an air raid. “We told them, ‘A war has begun, we must be nice to each other, we shouldn’t argue’. We told them make sure you finish every morsel because we don’t know when the next delivery of food will come. Even now we can’t tell them when they’ll next eat.“On the third night we heard bombs nearby. I walk into the dorm and say ‘children, explosions’ and they quickly and orderly go to the basement.Sasha, who is , said ‘I worry Putin will fire a nuclear bomb – he will destroy the world’. They dream the war will end, that they can go to summer camp, to school, on holiday.”Ukraine has the most orphans in Europe and , were already in care. But each day more need help as war claims the lives of their parents. Daria went on: “We are trying to offer humanitarian support to children from places like Izyum and Kharkiv that don’t have parents because of the war. “Our aim is that no child goes hungry. Countless children have been evacuated from the areas of the worst fighting. We try to find foster families.”  In Kyiv, Hope and Home’s local director Halyna has managed to relocate some children. Halyna is separated from her family and is terried for her -year-old mother in eastern Ukraine, where Russian troops are massing.She told us: “Orphanages, boarding schools, baby homes and hospitals are being bombed. I’m used to the sound of constant explosions and sirens.“The bridges have been blown up near my home to prevent any tanks crossing, so it’s dficult to help everyone we would want. But we expect many evacuees in Donetsk and Lugansk and Kharkiv city to need our support in the coming days. Most children won’t be able to be evacuated as it’s too unsafe. “And I’m worried the few who can be got out are not being monitored properly while moving over borders. They’re disappearing. Some are even being taken overseas. “We could be looking for children like them all over the world for many years to come.”  Charity CEO Mark Waddington, , – a veteran of similar work in Afghanistan and Iraq – is directing operations from the Ukraine-Moldova border. Mark, from Bakewell, Derbys, said: “There’s no central tracking system to know which children are where. They are going missing.” And that, says Hope and Homes, puts them at risk of beatings, rape, torture and trafficking. Worried Mark added: “Many children have some sort of family in Ukraine. The key is to keep them close because the further they go, the more dislocated they become from those families. “My big worry is the unaccompanied children, who will have fewer resources. Some will be destitute.” That is why the Sunday Mirror has teamed up with the charity to help – with details of how you can donate displayed above. There is urgent need for le-saving aid packs of food, water, clothes, medicine, pillows, sleeping bags, torches – even tape for windows to stop shattering glass causing harm. The charity has been working in Ukraine for  years and is dedicated to getting children into loving homes with extended family or foster parents.  Patrons include Bond girl Olga, , who said: “These children are stranded without staff, food and water while under attack from bombs and bullets. I struggle to comprehend the suffering of millions of families, including my own, caught up in this war. So imagine the suffering of children who are totally alone.” Former Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Dannatt is a patron too and has been associated with the charity for  years. He said: “Children are being left behind in the war zone to live feral in bombed-out orphanages. “I’ve seen refugee children separated from family and thrown into dangerous orphanages in foreign lands. We cannot allow history to repeat itself in Ukraine. Children belong in families.”  Aid workers are working in hellish conditions to save as many children as they can. A Polish charity has taken in , children, while a mission in Donetsk saw  led to safety. And Londoner Jeremy Posen, , was dubbed the “Angel of Odesa” and likened to a “British Schindler” after helping to lead , Jewish refugees – including  orphans – to safety. Jeremy is chief financial officer for the charity Tikva, which cares for homeless, abandoned and abused Jewish children.

The attack just six miles from NATO member Poland was a terrying step change that brought the West closer to a military confrontation with Moscow. Russian opposition politician Leonid Volkov, ex-chief of staff for jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, warned Putin was “crazy enough” now to use nuclear weapons. He told Sky Newsapos Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “It is now very clear that enormous cost has to be paid to stop this war. There are all the sanctions, creating a burden on the European economy. But this cost has to be paid because otherwise, Putin will just destroy the world.” Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletinhere And Poland’s President Andrzej Duda said he feared Putin would resort to using chemical weapons. He said: “I think that Putin can use anything right now, especially because he’s in a very dficult situation. If he used weapons of mass destruction this would be a game-changer.” The Yavoriv International Peacekeeping and Security Centre in the Lviv region has been used by foreign instructors, including ex-military from the UK, to train Ukrainians. So far, no British casualties have been reported to the UK authorities from the Lviv region airstrikes.The Yavoriv base is central to Putin’s paranoia about NATO moving closer to Russia and the attack ramped up tensions between Moscow and the West. The ex- Ukrainian national security chief Oleksandr Danylyuk said: “Because Russia obviously miscalculated the reaction of Ukrainians and the West they can start some provocations in NATO countries, probably Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, very soon.”Mr Danylyuk said the attack on the Yavoriv base was “a very clear message” that Moscow was ready to attack NATO troops supplying weapons to Ukraine. After the attack,  ambulances and fire fighting teams were seen rushing to the base. Many wounded foreigners were taken across the border to Poland for treatment.Speaking about the close proximity of the base to Poland, Markiyan Lubkivsky, an adviser to the Ukrainian defence minister, said: “This is very close. Nobody can be safe. It was a terrible attack. “So the geography of Putin’s attack is becoming wider.” In Ivano-Frankivsk, air raid sirens went off at .am, sending people into bomb shelters, where they stayed for three hours before the all-clear sounded. But shortly after, at .am, a massive explosion was heard throughout the city and a large column of black smoke rose from above Ivano-Frankivsk airport. Mayor Ruslan Martsinkiv confirmed Russian forces had hit the airport, but there were no casualties.  Shortly after the attack, Mr Martsinkiv warned residents: “Keep at home for your safety. “When the danger passes I will let you know.” On Sunday afternoon Ukrainian fighter jets patrolled the skies over Ivano-Frankivsk, for fear of long-range attacks by the Russians. Local security teams have been trying to track down Russian saboteurs feared to be in the city. Soldiers at the airport, which has now been hit three times, stopped the Mirror from approaching the bomb site, one of them telling us politely: “We must ask you not to come back here again.” Askedthe airport had been badly hit, he smiled and said: “I must ask you to go away and do not come back.”  Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine continue today as US and Chinese officials meet in Rome amid growing tension over the war. In his Sunday blessing in St Peter’s Square, Pope Francis said the killing of children and civilians was “barbaric”. He called besieged Mariupol a “martyred city” and appealed for “truly secure humanitarian corridors” to let people flee. He said: “Stop this unacceptable armed aggression before it reduces cities into cemeteries.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NatoSoldiersWar crimesUkraine crisisVladimir Putin\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The UK Government hit the cash-strapped oligarch with tight sanctions earlier this week in response to his alleged ties to Vladimir Putin and his Kremlin cronies.The sanctions included a total freezing of his assets, including Cha football club.But now it has been reported that the Russian businessman is unable to pay rent for the Crown Estate land under his -room Kensington mansion, the Daily Star reports.The rent arrear puts Abramovich at further risk of losing another sizeable asset on UK soil, the Wall Street Journal reports. Abramovichaposs London estate is just a short walk from Kensington Palace - home to Prince William, Kate Middleton and their children.  The oligarch is the owner of the stunning mega-mansion but potentially owes the Queen a £, yearly sum under a -year lease due to the land belonging to the Crown Estate.The Daily Star reports The sum will reportedly rise to £,-a-year at a later date.While his enormous wealth previously meant the rent was a non-issue, sanctions prevent the oligarchaposs money from being accepted. Do you think the sanctions against Russian oligarchs will remain in the long term  Let us know in the comments section.The Blues owner was aware of the risk in recent months and attempted to sell the property to no avail. It is understood thatthe sanctions remain in place and Abramovich is unable to pay the Queen, the Crown Estate can sue him and confiscate the property.  This follows the Russian being unable to sell Cha for a profit while the club is also extremely limited in their income sources and expenditure.Abramovich suffered more humiliation this week after being disqualied as a director of the Stamford Bridge side by the Premier League.

A man reported to be Luka Safronov was filmed staging a last-ditch protest only hours before the all of Russia ’s golden arches were due to shut indefinitely after the country’s invasion of Ukraine. The fast food giant employs around , people in Russia and it announced that after the countryaposs invasion of Ukraine it was going to shutter all of its  branches on Monday. This has left many fans heartbroken they’ll be left without their Big Macs or chicken nuggets and comes as the country is already suffering Coca Cola shortages after the company also decided to suspend business in Russia.But, some more business-savvy customers took advantage of the situation and are now flogging regular McDonald meals online for hundreds of pounds.Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here  According to screengrabs from a Russian online marketplace, McDonaldaposs meal prices have gone through the roof even though the food is being sold cold. Some went even as far as trying to flog four burgers, nuggets and dipping sauce for a massive £. One budding businesswoman or man was trying to cash in on just two burgers, two drinks and a cherry pie for £. On top of that, Coca-Cola has cancelled its supplies to Russia, which has seen the price of a single cold glass of coke shoot up to £.Follow all the latest updates on the conflict with our live blogBut Luka was interested in none of this, and took to the streets today in a show of defiance. He chained himself to the door of the restaurant in an attempt to fight its closure until its bitter end. The heartbroken Russian was reportedly shouting: “Closing down is an act of hostility against me and my fellow citizens!” Whilst he protests, other customers make the most of their last day of McDonald’s, walking past him and inside.  Later on, others can be heard laughing at the futile protest as crowds gather and the police approach him. In the end, police eventually drag him away, marking an end to his protest. It came after McDonaldaposs President and CEO Chris Kempckinski said in a letter to employees closing its stores, for now, was the right thing to do. He said: As we move forward, McDonald’s will continue to assess the situation and determineany additional measures are required. At this juncture, it’s impossible to predict when we might be able to reopen our restaurants in Russia. We are experiencing disruptions to our supply chain along with other operational impacts. We will also closely monitor the humanitarian situation. McDonald’s is far from the only company to pull the plug on their Russian operations.Starbucks shut its  stores whilst Disney, Ikea, Netflix, Spoty and countless others have all followed suit.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON McDonalds CorporationFoodPoliceFast foodRussiaRussia Ukraine war\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Serve the food you really want to eat by signing up for our tips and recipes and never be bored by your cooking againSign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

That would include killing him although it is not likely to be viable or desirable.” He believes the Russian president should at least face war crimes charges.“The best thing would be to see Putin deposed, arrested and tried, either in Russia or at the International Criminal Court,” he said.“But those options are highly unlikely ever to happen.” The retired Army officer said that while an assassination might be unacceptable to many people it also may be the only way to end the war and prevent future conflicts.He added: “If it came to assassination that might be unpalatable to many but his le has no greater value than the lives of the thousands he has already murdered in Ukraine and where and may well kill in the future.Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here  He is the ‘Supreme Commander in Chief’ of the Russian forces who ordered an illegal war of aggression and is a legitimate target. Our government planned the assassination of Adolf Hitler in the Second World War. Had he been removed instead of appeased in the late s we would not have suffered a conflict that killed  million people.Osama Bin Laden, Islamic State chief Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi and Iranian Republican Guard Commander Qasem Soleimani all represented direct threats to the West. They were all killed to counter those threats. Putin represents a permanent and deadly threat that will remain while he is in power. “Our priority should be to help remove him.

I didn’t believe him and told him so, and now he blackmails me with new trainers, clothes etc to keep my mouth shut.I caught him out again recently and this led to another row and he came right back at me and saidI told anyone, I would be looking for a new place to live!

Learners also have guaranteed entry to our HNC in Childhood Practice – a Level  qualication which is the same as first year at university – putting students in a strong position to apply for further university education.The Get Into Medical and Health Industries course offers learners Higher Human Biology, Higher English, and National  Maths – all mandatory qualications for applying to study in areas such as Paramedic Science, Nursing or Midwery. Additionally, we’ve been communicating closely with Glasgow Caledonian University’s Paramedic Science team to support students wishing to become a paramedic. The team will be assisting us to provide support and workshops which will help students to apply for the BSc Paramedic Science degree programme. The course also offers entry to our popular HNC Healthcare Practice, which transfers directly onto the second year on a number of nursing degree programmes.Finally, for students unsure of their final career destination, we’ve created groupings of National s and Highers to guide them towards their next step. Our National  and Higher Science courses offer students the chance to study Maths, English and the sciences. Our goal for this year is to help every student that comes through our doors discover a career path that best suits them. If you’re interested in any of these courses, or are looking for more information, please visit our website."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-west-street-subway-station-remain-close-today","story":"A GLASGOW Subway station in the Southside will remain closed today, SPT announced."},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-262-todays-wordle-word-8-march-hints-answer","story":"Wordle has taken the world by storm, andyou’ve not given in to playing the daily game, we can guarantee you’ve seen the elusive squares all over social media."},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-263-todays-wordle-word-9-march-hints-answer","story":"Wordle has taken the world by storm, andyou’ve not given in to playing the daily game, we can guarantee you’ve seen the elusive squares all over social media."},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-264-todays-wordle-word-9-march-hints-answer","story":"Wordle has taken the world by storm, andyou’ve not given in to playing the daily game, we can guarantee you’ve seen the elusive squares all over social media."},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-265-todays-wordle-word-11-march-hints-answer","story":"Wordle has taken the world by storm, andyou’ve not given in to playing the daily game, we can guarantee you’ve seen the elusive squares all over social media."},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-267-todays-wordle-word-13-march-hints-answer","story":"Wordle has taken the world by storm, andyou’ve not given in to playing the daily game, we can guarantee you’ve seen the elusive squares all over social media."},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-268-todays-wordle-word-14-march-hints-answer","story":"Wordle has taken the world by storm, andyou’ve not given in to playing the daily game, we can guarantee you’ve seen the elusive squares all over social media."},{"url":null,"title":"farmers union new committee chairman","story":"We are excited to announce a new home for the Evening Express content online, with a bigger and better website in partnership with The Press and Journal.

walk on the wild side at its latest meeting as Argyll Estates# head stalker set his sights on an entertaining evening.Tom Kirsop provided society members with an informative and imaginative talk at their February gathering, covering his work and experiences on the local estate.Growing up in Clydebank, Tom had always had an interest in animals and moved to Argyll as a forest ranger in Dalmally.Since starting to work with Argyll Estates, which he thoroughly enjoys, Tom has been able to develop his work with animals in many dferent ways.In Queen Victoria’s time the current ,-acre estate was on an even bigger scale and has witnessed a huge increase in the number of deer since then.This has been due to the lack of any natural predators and, with further planting of trees since the s, the deer have had more protective covering.Modern inventions such as drones and the use of argocats, have made it easier for people working on estates to estimate numbers of deer more accurately and to be able to meet the necessary annual targets of keeping the deer population to manageable levels.Working on the estate also involves a range of other projects, such as collecting data on golden eagles, barn owls, making fishing available at the Glen Shira dam and taking clients out stalking.More recently Tom has started up West Highland Wildle Tours to give people of all ages a real insight into the wildle and beautul scenery on our doorstep.For the society#s March meeting, Ken MacTaggart will give a presentation about #The Medieval Pilgrim Way to Loch Awe#.The venue will be Inveraray church hall on Tuesday March , starting at .pm.Everyone is welcome.

GHK broke the deadlock to score the first try of the game  minutes into the game, then missed the conversion.Mid Argyll then put together some great attacking plays and earned a penalty just outside the GHK -metre line.Inside centre Coll MacKay stepped up to score Mid Argyll#s first points of the campaign with a glorious conversion.  –  to GHK.GHK went on to score two more tries and one conversion # before disaster struck for Mid Argyll on the stroke of half time and with the score at  –  to GHK, as Wilson hobbled off with suspected knee ligament damage.With Wilson playing out of position in the front row, Mid Argyll had to reshuffle an already patchwork pack with Aaron McAllister moving from the wing to hooker and usual hooker Robbie Herd moving to prop.The new look front row finished off, Daniel Doherty doing well, as they held their own against an experienced opposition pack.Mid Argyll took time to settle into the new system, though, and GHK ran in two more converted tries.Mid Argyll almost produced the perfect reply when fly-half Logan Allen whipped a quick ball out to Gritten who, without actually catching the ball, flicked it on to Innes Patterson.Patterson beat two players and released Ed King-Venables who was caught by the GHK defence just short of the line.GHK ran the ball back up field but some great defensive play from flanker Gordon McLean, Self and MacArthur stopped them on the halfway line.A scrum to Mid Argyll saw scrum-half Calum Patterson pick the ball from the feet of McLean and, noticing a gap in the defence, broke through.He still had two more players to beat before he ran over the whitewash for Mid Argyll#s first try of the season # undoubtedly try of the match. MacKay converted for another two points and the score was  –  GHK.Having played with no subs, fatigue was starting to set in for the Argyll boys and with GHK using their subs they ran in a few more breakaway tries.Towards the end of the game GHK had one last attempt and broke through the Argyll defence, but from nowhere C Patterson found the determination and energy to chase the attacker down and fling out an arm to ankle tap him five metres short of the line and supporting was Lochlain Ellis to compete for the ball and earn Mid Argyll a deserved penalty.The final whistle sounded shortly after and the game finished  - to GHK.Mid Argyll enjoyed great hospitality from hosts GHK and Innes Patterson was awarded man of the match before the long journey home."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 3","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWhatever the rights and wrongs of Putin#s invasion of Ukraine, which has been shocking to witness from afar, one thing has shone through.The courage of the Ukranian people should serve as inspiration to each of us to stand against tyranny, in all its forms.As ever when the powerful invoke conflict, it#s the not-so-powerful and less wealthy who bear the brunt.

I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#.

Where, indeed, does compassion fit where survival is at stake Some offered to be left outside, while others were desperate to be in the shelter, stretching the truth as they did so.Then, with the zombies fast-approaching, another layer of information was revealed about each member.Paralympian Lorraine, in fact, is a wheelchair user. Nic, the rock-climbing medic, has a history of depression and is transgender . Imran is a tourist with English as a second language. Grant, it turned out, is an electrical whiz with a history of an eating disorder.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a vegetable plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is your key to successful growing and means that you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and vegetable beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing directly into the ground at this time of year, there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option not only does it provide a warm environment for germination but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests.If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, then even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"cowal gathering set for 2022 return","story":"Nobody could have predicted at the end of the th Cowal Gathering in August  that it would be another three years before the sights and sounds of one of Scotland#s best family days out again would be experienced again.The event will be held from Thursday August  to Saturday August  and will feature a full programme including the World Highland Dancing Championships, the Cowal Pipe Band Championship and the Cowal International Heavy Athletics Championship.Live music fans will be well catered for as The Gig at the Gathering s to rock the Stadium on Cowal Gathering Friday night, before some of Scotland’s best-known traditional bandson Cowal Gathering Saturday to the Live Music Tent.Cowal Gathering chairperson Ronnie Cairns spoke of his excitement that the -year-old gathering will be live this year.#This is the best possible news and I can#t wait to welcome competitors and spectators from across the world through the gates of Dunoon Stadium this August,# he said.#While Cowal’s Virtual Gathering entertained thousands of gathering fans across the globe in  and , there is nothing that compares to the atmosphere of games day.#We’ve waited for three years to gather together again and this year we’re going to make sure we celebrate in style.#Full details of this year’s programme, competition entry and ticket sales will be available over the coming months.Visit www.cowalgathering or email info@cowalgathering for more information."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclist mark beaumont supports dambusters ride","story":"The - and -mile cycling event is raising money for the RAF Benevolent Fund, the RAF’s leading welfare charity.It consists of two elements: a virtual ride on the weekend of May -, and a physical #heritage ride# taking place in Lincolnshire on Saturday May .The event pays tribute to the Dambusters, members of the RAF’s  Squadron who were assembled to bomb three dams in Germany’s Ruhr Valley on the night of May - .It was a risky raid, dropping the revolutionary bouncing bomb at low level, and the cost was high.

the previous weekend through a flurry of late goals, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils took the lead within the opening minute.Captain Keith Mitchell’s ball down the left channel found winger Scott Souden, who cut inside and rounded the far-advanced St Peter’s goalkeeper, way out of his penalty area, and tucked the ball home low from around  yards.The first half was a well-contested affair, with chances at both ends, with the Pupils’ Lewis McNaughton and Donald McCallum both going close with efforts at goal, while at the other end, St Peter’s continued to probe for an equaliser.This arrived just a few minutes before half-time, albeit in rather fortuitous circumstances, when a low shot from the visitors’ centre-forward from just inside the box evaded the grasp of keeper Alasdair Ferguson.Early into the second half, the Pupils found themselves - down after St Peter’s converted a penalty kick, skipper Mitchell having been adjudged to have brought down an onrushing midfielder.Souden then had a good chance double his and the Feather-sponsored Pupils’ goal tally after meeting Ryan Deans’ fine cross from the right-hand side of the box, but he couldn’t guide his cushioned header on target.The Pupils played the last  minutes of the match with  men when Jamie Burns was sent off for a tackle which was not malicious but was late.In believing that a goal-scoring opportunity had been denied, despite the foul taking place at least  yards from goal, the referee decided to show the Pupils defender a red card.This numerical advantage eventually paid off for the visitors in the closing minutes as a long throw-in was flicked on into a gaping space inside the box where a St Peter’s midfielder calmly side-footed a low right-foot shot into the net beyond Ferguson.It was a painful defeat for the Pupils, who acquitted themselves very well during the match and enjoyed spells of possession and pressure during the game, and in front of another healthy home crowd.However, their more clinical visitors took their chances when they arrived and managed to keep at bay most Pupils attacks in the second half to take all three points from Kintyre.Tomorrow , the Pupils host Glenvale FC, another Paisley side, in league action.Kick off is pm at Kintyre Park.

Scottish Conservative leader, and also Craig Hoy, South Scotland MSP, who visited them last month.The pair thanked the apprentices for their work in transforming derelict space to the rear of Dunbar

The news is full of harrowing scenes and many of us are affected emotionally by them, which is of course totally understandable.But it is also so important to find ways to protect our mental health from the despairing emotions they create. That’s completely dferent from not caring – of course we should care and do what we can to help. But looking after our mental health is part of that.The walk by the sea was my way to recharge emotionally and spiritually soaking in the beauty of the place I live, and appreciating all I have.As I said goodbye to my friend, I wanted toto this purpose and walked over the Greenhills between Prestonpans and Cockenzie.The sun was making the sea sparkle and I stood admiring the distant view of Edinburgh, the distinctive outline of the old town drawn in shadow against a blue sky.My dog Ceilidh came running back to me and dropped her ball at my feet, then waited with excited anticipation for me to throw it again.Dogs could really teach us a lesson in how to find joy in simple things, I thought to myself, as I bent down to retrieve the ball.As I picked it up, I noticed what looked like a solitary dandelion growing on the hillside nearby.Surely not, I thought, not in early March. But I walked towards it and, sure enough, my eyes hadn’t deceived me. A solitary and very early dandelion was standing defiantly in the breeze.I stood for a moment admiring its tenacity, and it reminded me of an old story about a gardener who tried to get rid of the dandelions which kept growing in the king’s garden.He would pull them out of the flowerbeds and mow them as soon as they appeared on the grass, but no matter what he did, they would eventually .The gardener was at a loss what to do, so he decided to seek advice from an old woman who was wise in many matters. He told her of all the measures he had taken but that nothing had worked no matter what he did, the dandelions eventually grew back.“There are two solutions to this,” was her reply.“The first solution is to continue what you have been doing: constantly pull them out and mow them down as soon as you see them. But you must know that they will eventually reappear.”“And the second solution ” asked the gardener.“Understand the lesson they teach us and celebrate their beauty and defiance.”The gardener was annoyed.“You are making fun of me,” he retorted angrily. “How can a dandelion teach us a lesson  It’s just a weed.”The old woman sipped her tea and smiled.“Have you ever been in a situation where you despair, where you have lost hope ”“Of course, many times,” replied the gardener, lowering his head.“Dandelions do not give up hope. They know that despite the efforts to destroy them, they will find a way to reappear. I discovered their lesson many years ago when I too tended a garden.”“But they are weeds!”“To you, yes. And they were also once for me, until I understood that they don’t just grow from the soil, but also from defiant hope.”The gardener thought for a moment: “We are not just talking about gardening are we ”The old woman sipped more tea, then spoke.“When I look around the world, full of despair, hatred, war and oppression, I hold onto the defiant hope of a dandelion.“I believe good can survive attempts to wipe it out, that peace can grow back, that love and understanding can triumph over evil and hate even in the darkest moments of loss, as long as we hold onto that hope and live by it.“That’s what this little flower has taught me, and why I no longer call it a weed.”The gardener nibbled his lip.“But what do I tell the king the next time he complains a dandelion is on his lawn ”The old woman finished her tea.“You tell him what I’ve just told you. I think he is the one who needs to learn the lesson most.”"},{"url":null,"title":"tried-aldis-new-chocolate-easter-egg-range-2022---ones-worth-buying","story":"From ice cream cone creations to vegan and gluten-free chocolate, I wanted to see which Aldi products are genuinely worth buying and whether the more luxurious, grand designs were good value.I must place a disclaimer here, I am a big fan of simple eggs made with tasty, good quality chocolate.For me, it isnt about novelty designs, chocolate shards spiking out and the price tags to match.So when I took a look at Aldis Easter selection, I decided my mission was to find an egg that looks great but tastes even better.One product that really intrigued me was Dairyfines chocolate ice cream egg- a blonde chocolate and wafer cone topped with a milk chocolate scoop, finished with mini eggs and biscuit crumb, as well as a popping candy cone base.Resembling the popular Cornetto ice cream, I was genuinely amazed by the attention to detail when I reached the end of the cone and discovered chocolate-covered popping candy and milk chocolate.It was a real treat to eat and I think Id have been bouncing off the walls in joy I received this as a kid.The one thing that really struck me about Aldis Easter egg offering was the effective use of recyclable materials, leaving you guilt-free when it comes to packaging. Not even the ice cream egg was covered in excess single-use plastic.The cone tasted almost like Caramac -thats a sweet up your street, this is the egg for you. The dferent combinations of chocolate and salty biscuit crumbs sprinkled on top left my sweet tooth feeling more than satisfied.  With the chocolate ice cream egg, you really have a bit of everything and I think its a worthwhile purchase.There is one major theme in Aldis Easter egg and chocolate collection for : salted caramel. Some of Aldis salted caramel options, pictured. I recruited a salted caramel expert, otherwise known as my boyfriend, to help review the full salted caramel selection. I thought salted caramel was something that didnt really y in quality - yet some of these eggs really stood out as the best. In my humble opinion, one of the best chocolate eggs from Aldi is the Moser Roth salted caramel egg  with hidden truffles, part of the Free From range.Despite not containing milk, egg, wheat and gluten, it gives out little bursts of salted caramel flavours with every bite and it wasnt overly rich. It would have been easy to eat the whole egg in one sitting, not to mention the tempting truffles hiding inside the box. For serious salted caramel fans, the ChocoChanger salted caramel eggis the choice to go for.From the moment you open the box, a strong aroma of caramel jumps out while the chocolate pops with creamy, salty sweetness.One of the more surprising salted caramel items was the rich, vegan, dark Belgian chocolate office bunnies- you couldnt have too many but one every so often would really hit the spot.Moser Roths luxury egg box from Aldi. If salted caramel is your idea of heaven, Id definitely recommend heading to Aldi for a browse. One of the most delicious chocolate treats from Aldi was the indulgent assortment of hand decorated chocolate eggs  with dferent types of fillings.From dark chocolate orange and speculoos to pistachio and macadamia, these chocolates are definitely ones youll struggle not to eat in one go. The flavours really worked well together - an ideal choice for people who love dferent types of chocolate and something visually appealing. One tasted like sticky toffee pudding while the raspberry chocolate had such delicate berry hints - absolutely perfect.Hazelnut filled eggs and hazelnut chocolate rabbits from Aldi. Now Im not the biggest hazelnut fan but Aldi has played an absolute blinder with this flavour in .Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny  leaves you with no words, just \"Mmmm\". Adorned with a cute green bow and bunny charm, the bunny looked great and tasted even better than you could expect.The smooth chocolate melts in your mouth while the hazelnut really hits the spot. If you love Ferrero Rocher, you need to try Aldis mouthwatering crispy hazelnut luxury filled eggs .A mix between Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, these chocolate eggs have a biscuity yet smooth texture with a gorgeous nutty aftertaste. Meanwhile, the Moser Roth Belgian milk and dark chocolate almond eggwas something unique, featuring salted almond butter.The combination of sweet yet salty almond butter with two types of chocolate was well balanced - though it did have a strong aftertaste, meaning its not one for those who can take or leave almond.There was just one Easter egg which left me wanting a little bit more than I got: the Dairyfine Chunky Egg Fruit and Nut .This chocolate egg is described as a thick Belgian milk chocolate egg packed with fruit and nut pieces - a combination Ive been known to enjoy.The chocolate didnt taste as special while the nuts were rather small and didnt have the crunch I yearned for. Saying that, it might be down to personal choice and you could completely disagree.From the selection I tried, there are three clear winners: Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny, Moser Roths Free From salted caramel egg with hidden truffles and the Dairyfine chocolate ice cream egg.You can browse the full Easter egg collection from Aldi via the website here.The Aldi website has even more eggs on offer - featuring cookies and cream, Eton mess and chocolate orange flavours."},{"url":null,"title":"council-announce-new-role-help-people-dealing-trauma","story":"The new temporary post is being funded from £, of Scottish Government cash and will see a trauma-informed policy developed within the council workforce and across services.The policy will help staff recognise and deal sensitively with people who have experienced trauma.A report to councillors said that funding had been given over two years to introduce training and policy around trauma.The council said that the temporary post was funded via the Scottish Government as part of a national trauma training programme which sought to raise knowledge, skills and understanding across dferent sectors of the workforce of psychological trauma.The postholder will assist East Lothian Council in raising awareness of the impact of trauma and how best to ensure the wellbeing of both employees and service users.Councillor Colin McGinn, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: “The Scottish Government is leading on an aspiration for the country and workforce to be trauma-informed.“This is aimed at ensuring for example that our council resources are being delivered in a way that is most efficient and effective, and help people to make best use of them.“It is well documented that iniduals who experience trauma have an increased risk of poorer physical and mental health.

The House of Commons backed it, though only one Scottish MP voted in favour. Then, just last year, Boris Johnson announced a lt on the cap on the the number of Trident nuclear warheads it can stockpile by more than  percent by the middle of this decade. This ended thirty years of gradual disarmament.UN Elder Mary Robinsons view on this was clear, “While the UK cites increased security threats as justication for this move, the appropriate response to these challenges should be to work multilaterally to strengthen international arms control agreements and to reduce - not increase - the number of nuclear weapons in existence.\"We are now in another chilling moment. Vladimir Putins invasion of Ukraine, his threats of \"consequences you have never seen\", have meant that the word nuclear is on our lips again.

Might the Russian leader be mad and power-hungry enough to use it Ian Blackford recently confirmed the continuing support of SNP for getting rid of Trident, saying, \"The idea that having nuclear weapons provides a deterrence that removes that threat is far-fetched, to say the least.\"Nuclear weapons are often described as a deterrent.

However, no advice is sought on the merits of otherwise of that approach.\"Ten years ago transport minister Keith Brown said \"no compelling case\" had been made that \"tendering inidual routes or unbundling the current contract\" would lead to greater benefits.At that time, there was concern that it would hive off CalMac’s four busiest routes, as suggested in a  consultation on future ferry services.Despite the Ernst and Young Project Neptune remit, the First Minister has ruled out privatising leline ferry services to Scotland’s island communities and said there are no plans to split up the CalMac network.Ms Clark, the West Scotland MSP has raised questions over asking for the Ernst and Young analysis which is supposed to look into unbundling - when Nicola Sturgeon has said there were no plans to do so.In a letter to the First Minister she said: \"I hope you appreciate the decision to commission private consultants to consider this option has caused considerable alarm among trade unions, amongst others, including the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers which received direct assurances in  that the Scottish Government would build a case for a permanent in-house operation of the Clyde  Hebrides Ferry Service contract.She has called for the Scottish Government to publish the firm’s independent review into governance of ferry services and has sought a guarantee that no part of the current Clyde  Hebrides ferry contract will be handed to a private company.Ms Clark, a vocerous campaigner to keep ferries in the public sector, has repeatedly called for an emergency plan to address issues affecting CalMac’s ageing fleet.She added: “Workers, passenger groups and island communities are clear that investment and replenishing our ageing fleet must be the priority, not selling off leline routes.“The Scottish Government must also rule out the sale of any part of the current Clyde  Hebrides contract to any private company.“Workers, passenger groups and island communities have been clear that renewed investment and replenishing our ageing fleet must be the priority, not selling off leline routes.”It comes as the state-owned ferry operator CalMac is having to handle an ageing ferry fleet with new leline vessels MV Glen Sannox and Hull  still languishing in the now state-owned Ferguson Marine shipyard, with costs of their construction more than doubling from the original £m contract and delivery over four years late.The debacle led to shipyard firm Ferguson Marine led by tycoon Jim McColl, who first rescued the yard going bust, leading to a Scottish Government takeover.An investigation by MSPs on the Scottish Parliament rural economy and connectivity committee into the procurement of the ferries described it in December,  as a “catastrophic failure”.There has since been a series of issues with breakdowns involving Scotlands ageing ferry fleet.While industry experts agree the working le of the ferries is  years,  of the -strong ferry fleet run is older than that, with eight past their th birthday.Analysis using official data shows that from , before devolution, to ,  ferries with a combined tonnage of , were launched - a replacement rate of one in . years.In the following  years, while the SNP was in power and while the working le of the existing fleet was extended from  years to  years, only five ferries with combined tonnage of , were built - a replacement rate of one every . years.A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: “Scottish Ministers have already ruled out privatisation and have no plans to split up the CalMac Ferries network.“The independent review of governance arrangements for Scottish Government leline ferry services will present a framework consisting of a range of options to the overarching objective of effective, efficient and economic delivery of leline ferry services, to enhance passenger experience and support local island economies.“The final report has been completed very recently and the Minister for Transport has given assurances in Parliament that it will be considered as soon as possible. We will then engage with all key stakeholders to ensure the most efficient and best value arrangement to deliver our key leline ferry services.”"},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-268-todays-wordle-word-14-march-hints-answer","story":"The aim of the game is to find a  letter word in only six attempts.The game uses the same rules as Scrabble, where only real words are allowed both in guesses and the result.If you get a letter in the right spot and form the correct word, the square turns green.Butthe guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot, the square turns yellow.Letters that are wrong turn grey to help the process of elimination for the six tries.If you’re still trying to save your streak, then don’t scroll down yet, maybe some hints will send you on your way.Today’s word starts with the letter S and ends with the letter T.It has one vowel.What is today’s Wordle answer, Monday, March  If you have given up on today’s game, then we can save you the misery.

A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said that in recent days, Russia had requested support from China, including military equipment, to press forward in its ongoing war with Ukraine.The official did not provide details on the scope of the request. The request was first reported by the Financial Times and The Washington Post.The Biden administration is also accusing China of spreading Russian disinformation that could be a pretext for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces to attack Ukraine with chemical or biological weapons.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has put China in a delicate spot with two of its biggest trading partners: the US and European Union. China needs access to those markets, yet it also has shown support for Moscow, joining with Russia in declaring a friendship with “no limits”.In his talks with senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi, Mr Sullivan will indeed be looking for limits in what Beijing will do for Moscow.“I’m not going to sit here publicly and brandish threats,” he told CNN in a round of Sunday news show interviews.“But what I will tell you is we are communicating directly and privately to Beijing that there absolutely will be consequences”China helps Russia “backfill” its losses from the sanctions.“We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a leline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country anywhere in the world,” he said.In brief comments on the talks, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian did not mention Ukraine, saying that the “key issue of this meeting is to implement the important consensus reached by the Chinese and US heads of state in their virtual summit in November last year”.The White House said the talks will focus on the direct impact of Russia’s war against Ukraine on regional and global security.Biden administration officials say Beijing is spreading  Russian claims that Ukraine was running chemical and biological weapons labs with US support.They say China is effectively providing coverRussia moves ahead with a biological or chemical weapons attack on Ukrainians.When Russia starts accusing other countries of preparing to launch biological or chemical attacks, Mr Sullivan told NBC’s Meet the Press: “It’s a good tell that they may be on the cusp of doing it themselves.”Pentagon spokesman John Kirby, on ABC’s This Week, said: “We haven’t seen anything that indicates some sort of imminent chemical or biological attack right now, but we’re watching this very, very closely.”There is growing concern inside the White House that China is aligning itself with Russia on the Ukraine war in hopes it will advance Beijing’s “vision of the world order” in the long term, according to a person familiar with administration thinking. vw,vw,px, px\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyshakes hands with a wounded soldier during his visit to a hospital in Kyiv The person was not authorised to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.The international community has assessed that Russia used chemical weapons in attempts to assassinate Mr Putin’s detractors such as Alexei Navalny and former spy Sergei Skripal.Russia also supports the Assad government in Syria, which has used chemical weapons against its people in a decade-long civil war.China has been one of few countries to avoid criticising the Russians for its invasion of Ukraine.

While all families are set to feel a squeeze come April, the lowest income households will be hit proportionately harder,” he said.“But the cost of living is only a crisis when people cannot afford it and Government support must be able to flexibly respond to this.”Meanwhile, the Resolution Foundation has published new research suggesting the prolonged conflict in Ukraine could see a second inflation spike this autumn, reaching more than % for the poorest households.The Chancellor is heading towards his spring statement with “good news on the public finances but terrible news on the family finances”, the think tank said.Borrowing for the current financial year is due to be £ billion lower than forecast in October, it said, with tax revenues expected to come in £ billion higher than forecast.But it warned the prospect for family finances is “bleak”, while the Ukraine crisis means there is “heightened uncertainty around the UK’s economic outlook, with the only certainty being that it has deteriorated markedly”.The think tank warned the conflict will cause higher inflation, which will lead to higher debt repayments for the Chancellor and a deeper income squeeze.It is also likely to “weaken GDP growth, and increase the probability of a recession”, it said. vw,vw,px, px\"The NEF said the implication of living with an income below the MIS is ‘having to choose between everyday essentials’ “A prolonged conflict in Ukraine would mean inflation being higher and longer lasting than previously forecast, with the drivers of inflation likely to sht over the course of the year,” the Resolution Foundation said.“While inflation is currently fairly evenly spread across the income distribution, that could change in the autumn as food price inflationcontinues to build, and rising wholesale energy costs drive another sharp increase in the energy bill price cap in October.“With the poorest tenth of households spending twice the share of their family budgets on food and energy bills compared to the richest tenth of households, the second inflation spike of  in the autumn could reach over % for these families.”The Foundation suggested the Chancellor should “revisit the uprating of benefits this April”.It said this would be a better idea than scrapping the planned national insurance rise – a move it claimed would be “poorly targeted”.James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The top priority should be to protect poorer households, who are most exposed to the biggest cost of living crisis Britain has faced in generations.“This can be done by increasing benefits by %, rather than .% as currently planned, in April. The Chancellor cannot protect Britain entirely from the dficult times that lie ahead, but he needs to act urgently to ensure the pain is fairly shared.”In response to the NEF’s analysis, Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “It’s shameful so many children are now growing up in poverty and insecurity under the Tories, in households unable to afford basic essentials.“Twelve years of Tory economic mismanagement have given us surging inflation, rocketing heating bills, punishing tax rises and two huge cuts to universal credit within six months.”A Treasury spokesman said: “Russia’s devastating invasion of Ukraine will have a huge impact on lives and livelihoods around the world and the effects will be felt across this country.“It is right that we do all we can to show solidarity with the people of Ukraine and work with our allies and partners to impose the most punishing sanctions to inflict maximum and lasting pain on Russia.“We know people are concerned about the cost of living, but we are already providing support worth over £ billion this financial year and next, including targeted support for energy bills, cutting the universal credit taper rate to help those on low incomes keep more of what they earn, and freezes to alcohol and fuel duties to keep costs down.”"},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-263-todays-wordle-word-9-march-hints-answer  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Matthew Martin played around several Bangor defenders and looked to pass up to Jason Campbell up front, who got into some promising positions.However, it was Bangor who broke the deadlock following a cross to the back post to take the lead.Play continued with both teams creating chances but neither were able to add to the scoreline before the end of the quarter.Bangor continued to apply pressure on lsquoHinch from the start of the second but the home side managed to manufacture counterattacks.lsquoHinch were playing the ball down the wings to Adam Dodds and Ross Connolly.Leslie Harrison played the ball out from the back to Andrew McIlwaine, only to be dispossessed by the Bangor defence.Play became end to end with teams trying to keep possession but unable to do so.

While museums are about objects, those objects have no signicance without people.People make things for particular purposes they use them, they value them, they discard them, they contemplate them. Museums try to understand objects in order to reach the peoplebehind them, understand their lives and so add meaning to our own.Local museums are concerned with all aspects of their communities. Their collections represent the inheritance, the culture, and the trust of their communities.Down County Museum has the largest collection of objects relating to farming in Ulster outside the national museums.Through the generosity of iniduals and families it has acquired not only the complete equipment of two of the last horse-powered farms in the county but a fine example of an early Ferguson tractor, with an invention which not only revolutionised agriculture but brought recognition to its County Down inventor throughout the world.A host of other items represent the history of a basic industry and developing way of le in County Down, from a wooden plough from Mourne to a donkey-powered milk churn from Ballyroney to the first reaper and binder in the area, to hay sweeps, rakes and potato diggers, scythes, rope twisters, turnip cutters, barn fans, churns, butter pats, sheep shears, horse harness, slipes, carts, Young Farmersrsquo Club trophies and records, and valuable medals given for agricultural improvements on the iable soils of County Down.We should not forget that we build on what has gone before and that is as true of our most important industry as of any other.One object which is almost entirely forgotten was the block-wheeled car, with solid wooden wheels, which was the ubiquitous load carrier before the introduction of the large-wheeled lsquoScotch cartrsquo in the s.The agricultural census of  recorded  of these lsquocarsrsquo in the  townlands of the south Ards alone.

","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest secured their spot in the semi-final stages of the Harry Clarke Cup after they dramatically defeated a favoured Ardglass side on Saturday.Despite trailing by two goals with less than five minutes left on the clock, Forest managed to force extra-time, and then penalties, following a bizarre conclusion to the  minutes that ended with a red card and a fairytale finish.Sean Dornan was the hero between the sticks in the shootout after saving two separate Ardglass efforts while converting his chance from the spot for good measure.To add further to the drama, Dornan was initially outfield for Forest before swapping positions with lsquokeeper Brian McVeigh a minute before the final whistle of extra-time sounded.It was a sunny yet bitterly cold Ardglass venue but that didnrsquot deter things from immediately heating up on the pitch as both teams sought to gain the upper hand early.However, it was the home side who would take the lead within the opening ten minutes when striker Michael Magee struck the ball into the net from close range.This lead would be short-lived as the visitors penned Ardglass back into their own half and soon Castlewellan were rewarded for their relentless attacking.A quickly played pass across the box was met by Forest forward Shane Mooney, who made no mistake with his right footed finish beyond the outstretched arms of Ardglass custodian Mark Armstrong.Chances followed for the visitors, including a Sean Dornan effort that cracked the outside of the post from range and an opportunity for striker Scott Kinley, which quickly diminished after he took too much time on the ball.However, Ardglass refused to be bullied for a prolonged period of time from a side a ision below in the Newcastle League and often launched some dangerous looking counterattacks.One such breakaway ended with Shane Teggart earning his Ardglass side a corner which led to a goalmouth scramble before the ball was headed off the line and away from danger.Ardglass began to find their feet and found more success up front thanks to the probing runs of marksman Magee, who was giving the Castlewellan defence plenty to think about.The Ardglass number nine was unfortunate to see his free-kick effort saved at the second time of asking, but he did give his side the chance to go in front when his nty footwork inside the Forest box resulted in a mistimed tackle and a penalty awarded.Stephen Deegan stepped up a coolly dispatched the spot kick, sending Castlewellan custodian Brian McVeigh the opposite direction in the process.Castlewellan continued to battle with Donagh Steele in the middle of the park having a particularly notable performance as he chased down every loose ball available.Despite their good work, Forest may count themselves fortunate not to go into the break further behind as the usually clinical Magee fluffed his lines from ten yards, missing a golden opportunity for Ardglass.The drama of the first half carried onto the second and in a matter of minutes the referee was forced to make another potentially game changing decision.Once again, the hosts released Magee into the danger area although this time he had Castlewellan captain Aidan Dornan hot on his heels.The move ended with Magee on the ground with his hands in the air appealing for a penalty, however, this time appeals were swtly waved off.The contest quickly turned into a feisty affair as Ardglass looked to overrun their counterparts by sending bodies forward in waves of attacks.Jordan Finnegan saw his snapshot smartly saved by Forest lsquokeeper McVeigh before strike partner Magee saw another one of his efforts tipped wide by the impressive Castlewellan number one.Midway through the half Castlewellan were afforded a seldom opportunity, but Sean Dornan opted to pass when he maybe should have tried his luck at goal instead.Soon after, a punt upfield from the Ardglass defence evaded the heads of the opposition, including lsquokeeper McVeigh, and almost resulted in a rather comedic goal.However, the Castlewellan defence recovered just in the nick of time to avoid any red faces.With  minutes left of the , Ardglass would finally add to their tally after a sumptuous dead ball delivery from Neil Teggart lofted onto the head of team-mate Malachy Crangle, who directed his effort into the net.Castlewellan knew the clock was against them but firmly pushed for a way back into the tie. Rossa McCartan was introduced to the fray off the bench in what proved to be a decisive move from Castlewellan head coach Conall Burns.With a minute of regulation time to go, McCartan danced his way down the line and into the Ardglass box where he was adjudged to be brought down unfairly.Forest striker Mooney converted the penalty to notch his second goal of the match but there was little belief from the surrounding spectators that there would be enough time for another opportunity.In what was seemingly one last throw of the dice, Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick inside their own half and players gathered at the edge of the opposing -yard line waiting for the delivery.However, before the free-kick could be taken, some roughhousing from both sides would end with Ardglass substitute Aidan Watson being shown the red card after he seemingly lost his discipline and kicked out at the opposition.A bizarre series would follow, as the initial free-kick was then brought forward to the -yard line where Watson committed his foul, and from here Castlewellan would take full advantage.Sean Dornan struck his lowly driven effort beneath the jumping Ardglass wall, and goalkeeper Mark Armstrong could only momentarily ert the ball away from goal before the onrushing Callum McCabe would tap-in to draw the sides level.With that, the final whistle of regulation time was blown and extra-time was set to commence.To both sidersquos credit, the intensity of the match remained but neither manufactured any real clear cut chances.Ardglass striker Magee picked up a yellow card but the most notable move of extra-time came from the Castlewellan management, whoopted to swap midfielder Sean Dornan for goalkeeper McVeigh a minute before the penalty shootout.This would prove decisive as Dornan broke Ardglass hearts and saved two penalties, giving his Castlewellan side a memorable victory and place in the last four of the Harry Clarke Cup.Following the dramatic encounter, Dornan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe were low on numbers coming down here and we probably werenrsquot as strong as we could be, he said.ldquoBut the credit has to go to the boys, we worked hard and it worked out for us.ldquoWe went - down but we battled hard, got a penalty and a fluky goal.He added: ldquoThe Harry Clarke Cup is blown wide open, Ardglass was probably the favourites and we knocked them out so itrsquos anyones now.Ardglass: M Armstrong, C Kearney, M Crangle, N Teggart, C OrsquoShea, M Rooney , S Deegan, SP Halpin, M Magee, J Finnegan, S Teggart.Subs: S Dorrian, A Watson, J Deegans, A OrsquoShea.Yellow card: M MageeRed card: A WatsonCastlewellan: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, A Dornan , D Gilmore, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, S Kinley, J Murnin.Subs: C McVeigh, R McCartan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  March 11%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash Work has begun on the first phase of a major agricultural marketing centre for the Downpatrick area.Diggers moved in this week to begin excavating a ten-acre site for a co-operative project which is being seen as essential to the future of the local farming community.A pound, livestock mart will form the first stage of an ambitious scheme by the Downpatrick Co-Operative Marketing Centre, a limited company which has been set up by more than  local farmers.A covered sale yard and ancillary buildings on the Bonecastle Road site are expected to be finished in time for trading to begin by late July.

There will also be new footpaths, lighting and drainage.None of the statutory agencies have objected to the local authority proposal, but concern was expressed by one resident about the anti-social behaviour of young drivers using the car park.Recommending that the council proposal should be approved, planners said the current overspill car park is considered to be site a ldquosufficient distance from adjacent dwellings to prevent ldquoany unacceptable impacts.Planners say taking into account planning policy, consultee responses, planning history and responses, approval is recommended, also stipulating that prior to any work starting, a final drainage assessment, including a detailed drainage network design and demonstration of how so-called out-of-sewer flooding will be addressed, must be agreed with them.No retained trees will be allowed to be felled or uprooted as part of the work to provide the new parking spaces.Planners have also warned that care will need to be taken during the construction phase to ensure there are no polluting discharges.The contractor appointed to provide the new spaces must submit a so-called final construction method statement and that work cannot begin until approval is in place for the discharge of storm water from the development site has been secured from the Rivers Agency. A final drainage assessment must also be submitted.Protection zones for badger setts in the area must be established, with all trees and hedgerows retained with no external lighting provided until a lighting plan has been submitted to planners and approved.Local politicians are pleased that the main car park in Newcastle is to be extended which will make a dference during the busy holiday periods.They say there will be aon the local authorityrsquos signicant investment to provide additional parking for visitors and residents in the resort.Previously, the overflow area for cars at the rear of Donard Park has been described as ldquounsightly and particularly dficult to manage in wet weather, with the extension providing a modern parking facility to meet the needs of a range of drivers.Itrsquos also understood that the overspill car park may include a number of charging points for electric vehicles..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Newcastle ‘needs and deserves’ new centre  ","story":"A DETAILED report on building a new multi-million pound leisure centre in Newcastle is expected to be completed shortly.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials are working with consultants to develop an outline business case which is designed to pave the way for the eagerly-awaited new complex, with councillors expected to be provided with a copy of the report within the next few weeks.The rear of the existing Newcastle Centre and the outdoor Tropicana swimming pool are to be demolished to make way for the new town centre leisure complex, with formal planning approval to send in the bulldozers expected to be rubber-stamped at todayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.Once the demolition work has been completed, the rear of the Newcastle Centre will be restored to its original design, with two sash windows reinstated to match those of the original building.In addition, alterations will be carried out to the boundary wall, alongside the removal of a reinforced concrete fence  and metal gates. The gates will be replaced with a perforated double metal gate.Planners say the removal of the ldquobulky rear extension to the existing listed building can only be seen as a betterment to its integrity and intrinsic character ldquo.In addition, they say the demolition proposal does not ldquooffend the essential character of the building with its setting retained and its features of special interest remaining intact and unimpaired.Planners have also stipulated that any proposed demolition work proposed within one metre of the Newcastle Centre shall be carried out by hand and that no power tools must be used to ensure no damage to the existing building.The proposed new leisure complex will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.Itrsquos also understood that the eagerly-awaited new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which enjoys protected status, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Late last year, it was revealed that an economist and team of expert consultants would be appointed to design the new leisure facility, with Newry, Mourne and Down Council adding an additional pound, to its capital programme to help deliver the new complex.The planned investment at the current Newcastle Centre housed in the Annesley Buildings is also a key plank of the local authorityrsquos capital investment programme.Mournes councillor, Laura Devlin, said it was well known that Newcastle ldquoneeds and deserves a fit-for-purpose leisure centre.She said while the local authority has faced many hurdles over recent years in delivering a new leisure complex, all Mournes councillors understand there are no longer any available sites within the town which are of a suitable size to build what is needed.But Cllr Devlin said this could not be used as an excuse, highlighting the need to deliver for the people of town and visitors.ldquoThe council is proceeding with plans for a replacement centre on the current Newcastle Centre site, she continued. ldquoFrom the outset of this process I have said that this must include a pool and that remains my position.ldquoI appreciate there are swimming pools within the district butwe are serious about tourism we need to look at a rainy day offering in Newcastle and I believe that a pool would tick that box, as well as providing a superb facility for our local community.Cllr Devlin said she looks forward to forward to seeing the outline business case and the eagerly-awaited project progressing at long last.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely fashion.Two sites were previously identied for the new centre, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option. However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School site at nearby Shanslieve Drive but lost out in a bidding war to supermarket giant Lidl.Local politicians say they are keen to see progress on the new leisure complex and are pleased that it will now include an indoor pool as residents have been looking for a modern leisure complex for over two decades..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Newcastle man Jack to embark on sky jump in memory of aunt  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE man will jump out of a plane from , feet to raise money for a childrenrsquos cancer charity.Jack Welshhas decided to take the plunge in memory of his aunt Joanne, who sadly passed away in .Going one step further in his fundraising efforts, the full-time barber is also opting to completely shave his head in a bid to raise even more money for his chosen charity, Cancer Fund for Children.ldquoI have been wanting to do something like this for a while so I thought I would just go for it, said Jack.ldquoMy aunty is the main inspiration behind the jump and I feel like the chosen charity is definitely a worthwhile one.ldquoMy family couldnrsquot be any more supportive, they are behind me all the way so that helps spur me on as the big day approaches.Jack will take to the skies on Saturday, March , and will also shave his head on the same day.

We are interested in solutions and putting people first and the Fishing and Seafood Development programme is one solution we must deliver on.ldquoI hope voters will remember issues such as this in May as they will be the people who elect a new Executive.Cllr Curran said the fishing and fish processing industries were an essential part of le in Ardglass and the local economy.ldquoThese industries must be protected and enhanced and this is all achievable, he declared.ldquoIt is welcome news that approval has been given for the programmersquos strategic outline case which allows DAERA to procure consultants to take forward detailed environmental and technical studies.ldquoHowever, this approval only allows DAERA to incur expenditure on work required to inform the later outline business cases upon which any later decisions to proceed with infrastructure development, such as the deepening of Ardglass harbour will be based.Cllr Curran said he hoped that the absence of the NI Executive and the uncertainty of its future does not obstruct the progress of the ldquovital fishing programme which offers so much potential for Ardglass and other local ports..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Regional rates frozen for business owners  ","story":"BUSINESSES and ratepayers have received some good news with confirmation that the regional rate has been frozen for another year.The decision by Stormont finance minister Conor Murphy is part of a poundm province-wide rates support package for the new financial year.He has also confirmed that the small business rate relief scheme benefiting thousands of business premises will also continue, explaining the message from businesses is that the rates holiday was a vital leline for them during the pandemic.The finance minister said the poundm rates support package to support the recovery will provide all businesses with a one month rates holiday with the exception of utilities and larger food stores while retail, hospitality, tourism, leisure, childcare, newspapers and airports will receive a three months rates holiday.Mr Murphy said businesses in the hardest hit sectors had paid no rates since March  and will now pay no rates until July.He said freezing the regional rate is intended to help with the rising costs being faced by families and businesses alike, with the extension of the small business rate relief scheme resulting in businesses automatically receiving a reduction of between % and % on their rates.The finance minister added: ldquoSmall businesses are at the core of our local economy and have a vital role in contributing to employment opportunities.ldquoI am glad to announce the continuation of the small business rate relief scheme which currently supports almost , business premises. The extension of the scheme sends a strong message of the important contribution of the small business sector.Last month, Newry, Mourne and Down Council imposed a .% rates rise to finance its poundm budget, with the hike the second lowest increase of any of the provincersquos  local authorities.Rates are made up of two parts mdash the regional rate and the district rate.The regional rate is set by Stormont and, along with the block grant from the Treasury, pays for the likes of schools, health and roads. The district rate is set by local councils and pays for services that the council is responsible for, such as refuse collection, leisure provision and street cleaning.While councils have the power to set dferent rates increases for households and businesses, this year they have chosen to instead set one percentage increase for both.Domestic and non-domestic rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation of homes and businesses by the combined district and regional rate.Domestic and non-domestic rates are set in terms of the number of pence in each pound of the value of your home business. For instance, in the Newry, Mourne and Down council area, the domestic rate for the   financial year is . pence, while the non-domestic rate will be . pence.Key factors that councils have to take into account when setting their district rate, including cost of living, inflation, the councilrsquos own financial reserves and other income, and the wider economic outlook.Last year, several councils chose to freeze their rates due to the impact of the pandemic, dipping into their reserves to absorb the loss of income. Others chose to raise their rates slightly, however this has meant playing a degree of catch-up this year, when all councils have opted to hike their rates.As a result of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos rates increase, local communities are set to share a poundm funding boost in the new financial year.The organisation said it recognises that communities have been hit hard over the past number of years, outlining plans for poundm of financial assistance grants for community and voluntary organisations.In addition, the local authority will also manage the establishment of the Peace Plus Partnership as well as the submission and delivery of the Peace Plus Local Authority Action Plan worth around poundm.The action plan will provide priority projects on a cross-community basis, resulting in shared and inclusive local services, facilities and spaces and make a ldquosignicant and lasting contribution to peace and reconciliation for the whole community.In addition, pound.m will be invested on a new fleet of over  modern and more efficient vehicles across a range of services including refuse collection, district cleansing and parks and grounds maintenance with the new vehicles expected to arrive before the end of this year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Sense have been at  the core of Páuric’s  development and they have done a lot for us  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman braved the winds and rain last month to walk  miles in aid of the disability charity, Sense.Janine Laverty was inspired to take on Sensersquos Run For challenge to give back to the charity which supports her disabled son.So far Janine has raised an amazing total of over pound, through her challenge, but she is aiming to raise pound, in total.Participants challenged themselves to run or walk a distance of their choosing over the month of February.Janine finished her -mile target on February , completing her challenge with a seaside walk.She undertook the walk to support the charity which has meant so much to her family since her youngest son Paacuteuric, , was born premature and has cerebral palsy, developmental delay and dficulties with his vision.Family and friends have rallied around Janine , joining her on walks and generously donating to Sense.Sense services in Northern Ireland have supported Paacuteuric since he was an infant, providing key interventions such as play therapy, music therapy and guide dog days which boosted his development.Janine also credits Sense with providing some of her most precious family memories support from the charity allowed her to take both her sons swimming at the same time, and the family have attended fun-filled Sense days out to places including Ark Open Farm, Armagh Planetarium and Jungle Northern Ireland.Janine explained: ldquoSense Northern Ireland have been at the core of Paacuteuricrsquos development and they have done an awful lot for us.

Teaching, and hence learning, relies on communication, the essential verbal and non-verbal communication between child and teacher cannot take place behind a mask. All those non-verbal cues which teachers use to gauge understanding are being lost.A child’s capacity to express feelings and emotions is being affected by being masked. Some children cannot make eye contact and can’t sleep, clear signs of psychological distress and of course, impacting on their capacity to learn. Referrals to schools’ counselling services have rocketed.How can it be healthy for a child to wear a mask six or seven hours per day How can we justy a measure which has no benefit to children and accept the damage to their education, mental health and social development It is long past the time to end this abuse of our children.Hugh McCarthy, , Newtownabbey——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It will involve the building of new homes, a -bedroom hotel, a cinema and leisure facility, a public realm scheme, new streets, an events space and new cafes and restaurants.The applicant said the project will create approximately  jobs per annum during construction, and  further jobs once it is “operational”.The former BM Bargains, Oxfam and Hospice shops on Main Street will be demolished, as well as other buildings on King Street, Southwell Road and Queen’s Parade.An online petition calling for an end to the Stormont delay had gathered over , signatures.Ms Mallon said: “After fully examining all matters involved I have concluded, in this instance, that this application does not raise issues of such importance that their impact is considered to extend to a sub-regional or regional level, and the circumstances of this case are not considered exceptional such as to render use of my power to ‘call in’ the application.”Mayor of Ards and North Down, Councillor Mark Brooks said: “I am absolutely delighted that Minister Mallon has ended this long-running impasse. Finally we have the green light for the Queen’s Parade development to proceed.“I know there will be a collective cheer across the town as so many have been eagerly awaiting this positive news. I would like to thank all the residents and businesses that have taken time over recent weeks to write to the minister to lobby for this decision – community action has paid fantastic idends.“The Queen’s Parade development, combined with the council’s own plans to regenerate Bangor Waterfront, offers the potential for more than £m of investment ... over the next  years, delivering new attractions, accommodations and commercial opportunities.

That’s really what it all reduces down to.”He said there was a “very simple question” that all other unionist parties had to answer: “Will you or will you not in those circumstances enthrone and enable Sinn Fein by acting as deputy first minister ”Mr Allister continued: “If someone can’t answer that question then why would they deserve the vote of someone who wants to make sure that there should not be a Sinn Fein first minister ”The TUV leader said he wanted this question to be the central one that pro-Union voters put to unionists canvassing them during the election campaign.Despite his at times blistering criticism at the conference of both the DUP and the UUP, Mr Allister advised unionist voters to put their second and third preferences for pro-Union parties once they had given the TUV number one on the ballot paper.“In a PR election you have the luxury of choice and I have been very clear about this – vote down the ballot for anyone who ticks the box for being anti-protocol and pro-Union, although of course it’s for the electorate to decide. “I am inviting people to vote TUV number one and then after that don’t stop there, exercise your franchise and keep voting for pro-Union, anti-protocol candidates down the line.”Asked what would happenthe protocol was still in place after the Assembly elections in May, Mr Allister said: “The electorate can believe TUV. The TUV will not be Sinn Fein’s bridesmaid and we will not be enabling a Sinn Fein first ministerthat situation arises.”He said the “fear of a Sinn Fein first minister can be laid to rest”no unionist parties support that possible scenario after the election.Askedhis unionists rivals will follow the same policy, Mr Allister said: “Well I can only promise for the TUV but I can challenge and I can exhort with respect to others some of whom have a record of saying, ‘vote for us to stop Sinn Fein’ and then they are the very people who partner Sinn Fein in government. So, I think some of these people have a credibility problem in that regard. The TUV does not have that problem and so for people looking for certainty then they have the absolute assurance thatthey vote TUV they can be guaranteed their vote will not be used to empower Sinn Fein.”On the British government’s intentions over negotiations with the EU on the protocol, Mr Allister said: “Of course there is this huge distraction at the moment with Ukraine. But they will only ever change it it is put upon them that unionism is holding the line. Which is that the thing that is unconscionable, unbearable will not be put up with.“Unionism has made mistakes with the ‘Poots posts’ implementing the protocol. I hope people are learning from those mistakes and we can stand in ‘unalterable objection’ to it as the unionist declaration on Ulster Day stated. That is clear and it means there is no fraying around the edges or tinkering with the protocol, making acceptable something which is catastrophic for the Union. It is an irredeemable fact that it has to go. “At the end of the day, no system, no imposition, is sustainableit doesn’t have the consent of the people of Northern Ireland.”Jim AllisterSinn FeinNorthern IrelandMichelle ONeillUnionism  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularAccordions worth tens of thousands stolen in Northern Ireland burglaryCheapest fuel prices in Northern Ireland: Here are the cheapest places to buy diesel and petrol in NIVladimir Putin psychological profile: A psychopath who is likely to get emotional payoffs from Russia’s bloodshed in Ukraine, plus possible impact of rumoured illness or cancerIf the ‘price’ of Stormont is implementing the Northern Ireland Protocol then unionists should give up on devolution, Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said todayMore roads closed in Northern Ireland due to fallen treesMost PopularBest boot deals  - warm winter boots for women, including ankle, knee high and Cha bootsBest rattan garden furniture UK : our pick of table and chair sets, sun loungers, and sofas for summerBest multi cookers UK : the best electric and multicookers including the Ninja Foodi MaxBest air beds for camping UK : inflatable beds to keep you comfy from Outwell, Vango, and SnugpakNI Running prodigy Emer McKee sets new world record at -years                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe request comes amid tensions about the ongoing war ahead of a Monday meeting in Rome between top aides for the US and Chinese governments.In advance of the talks, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan bluntly warned China to avoid helping Russia evade punishment from global sanctions that have hammered the Russian economy. “We will not allow that to go forward,” he said.The prospect of China offering Russia financial help is one of several concerns for President Joe Biden. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said that in recent days, Russia had requested support from China, including military equipment, to press forward in its ongoing war with Ukraine. vw,vw,px, px\"A Ukrainian firefighter drags a hose inside a large food products storage facility which was destroyed by an airstrike on the outskirts of Kyiv The official did not provide details on the scope of the request. The request was first reported by the Financial Times and The Washington Post.The Biden administration is also accusing China of spreading Russian disinformation that could be a pretext for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces to attack Ukraine with chemical or biological weapons.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has put China in a delicate spot with two of its biggest trading partners: the US and European Union. China needs access to those markets, yet it also has shown support for Moscow, joining with Russia in declaring a friendship with “no limits”.In his talks with senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi, Mr Sullivan will indeed be looking for limits in what Beijing will do for Moscow.“I’m not going to sit here publicly and brandish threats,” he told CNN in a round of Sunday news show interviews.“But what I will tell you is we are communicating directly and privately to Beijing that there absolutely will be consequences”China helps Russia “backfill” its losses from the sanctions..remove“We will not allow that to go forward and allow there to be a leline to Russia from these economic sanctions from any country anywhere in the world,” he said.In brief comments on the talks, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian did not mention Ukraine, saying that the “key issue of this meeting is to implement the important consensus reached by the Chinese and US heads of state in their virtual summit in November last year”.The White House said the talks will focus on the direct impact of Russia’s war against Ukraine on regional and global security.Biden administration officials say Beijing is spreading  Russian claims that Ukraine was running chemical and biological weapons labs with US support.They say China is effectively providing coverRussia moves ahead with a biological or chemical weapons attack on Ukrainians.When Russia starts accusing other countries of preparing to launch biological or chemical attacks, Mr Sullivan told NBC’s Meet the Press: “It’s a good tell that they may be on the cusp of doing it themselves.”Pentagon spokesman John Kirby, on ABC’s This Week, said: “We haven’t seen anything that indicates some sort of imminent chemical or biological attack right now, but we’re watching this very, very closely.”There is growing concern inside the White House that China is aligning itself with Russia on the Ukraine war in hopes it will advance Beijing’s “vision of the world order” in the long term, according to a person familiar with administration thinking. vw,vw,px, px\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyshakes hands with a wounded soldier during his visit to a hospital in Kyiv The person was not authorised to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.The international community has assessed that Russia used chemical weapons in attempts to assassinate Mr Putin’s detractors such as Alexei Navalny and former spy Sergei Skripal.Russia also supports the Assad government in Syria, which has used chemical weapons against its people in a decade-long civil war.China has been one of few countries to avoid criticising the Russians for its invasion of Ukraine. China’s leader Xi Jinping hosted Mr Putin for the opening of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, just three weeks before Russia invaded on February .During Mr Putin’s visit, the two leaders issued a ,-word statement declaring limitless friendship.The Chinese abstained on UN votes censuring Russia and has criticised economic sanctions against Moscow. It has expressed its support for peace talks and offered its services as a mediator, despite questions about its neutrality and scant experience mediating international conflict..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: US official: Russia seeking military aid from China article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe New Economics Foundationhas estimated that . million people will be short of funds to meet the “acceptable standard of living” by April , by an average of £, per year.This represents more than a thirdof the population, the think tank said, and means nearly halfof children will be part of households “unable to provide them a decent standard of living”.The figure rises to % for children in single-parent households, and % for those in families out of work, according to the NEF’s estimates.Labour said it was “shameful” that “so many children are now growing up in poverty and insecurity under the Tories”.The NEF measured the cost of living using the minimum income standard , as calculated by Loughborough University’s Centre for Research in Social Policy.The MIS produces budgets for dferent household types, based on what the public thinks is needed for an “acceptable standard of living” in the UK.The NEF compared these budgets with people’s incomes, creating what it said was “an accurate picture of how many people will be unable to afford the cost of living” by April.It said the implication of living with an income below the MIS is “having to choose between everyday essentials”.“The average couple with children with an income below the MIS will miss the threshold by £. per week,” the NEF said. vw,vw,px, px\"The MIS produces budgets for dferent household types “Missing the MIS by such a large amount will force people to make impossible choices.”Sam Tims, an economist at the NEF, said “there is little time left for the Chancellor to take action to avert the worst real-terms incomes squeeze in  years”.“The cost of living is increasing faster than at any point in recent history. While all families are set to feel a squeeze come April, the lowest income households will be hit proportionately harder,” he said..remove“But the cost of living is only a crisis when people cannot afford it and Government support must be able to flexibly respond to this.”Meanwhile, the Resolution Foundation has published new research suggesting the prolonged conflict in Ukraine could see a second inflation spike this autumn, reaching more than % for the poorest households.The Chancellor is heading towards his spring statement with “good news on the public finances but terrible news on the family finances”, the think tank said.Borrowing for the current financial year is due to be £ billion lower than forecast in October, it said, with tax revenues expected to come in £ billion higher than forecast.But it warned the prospect for family finances is “bleak”, while the Ukraine crisis means there is “heightened uncertainty around the UK’s economic outlook, with the only certainty being that it has deteriorated markedly”.The think tank warned the conflict will cause higher inflation, which will lead to higher debt repayments for the Chancellor and a deeper income squeeze.It is also likely to “weaken GDP growth, and increase the probability of a recession”, it said. vw,vw,px, px\"The NEF said the implication of living with an income below the MIS is ‘having to choose between everyday essentials’ “A prolonged conflict in Ukraine would mean inflation being higher and longer lasting than previously forecast, with the drivers of inflation likely to sht over the course of the year,” the Resolution Foundation said.“While inflation is currently fairly evenly spread across the income distribution, that could change in the autumn as food price inflationcontinues to build, and rising wholesale energy costs drive another sharp increase in the energy bill price cap in October.“With the poorest tenth of households spending twice the share of their family budgets on food and energy bills compared to the richest tenth of households, the second inflation spike of  in the autumn could reach over % for these families.”The Foundation suggested the Chancellor should “revisit the uprating of benefits this April”.It said this would be a better idea than scrapping the planned national insurance rise – a move it claimed would be “poorly targeted”.James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The top priority should be to protect poorer households, who are most exposed to the biggest cost of living crisis Britain has faced in generations.“This can be done by increasing benefits by %, rather than .% as currently planned, in April. The Chancellor cannot protect Britain entirely from the dficult times that lie ahead, but he needs to act urgently to ensure the pain is fairly shared.”In response to the NEF’s analysis, Jonathan Ashworth, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “It’s shameful so many children are now growing up in poverty and insecurity under the Tories, in households unable to afford basic essentials.“Twelve years of Tory economic mismanagement have given us surging inflation, rocketing heating bills, punishing tax rises and two huge cuts to universal credit within six months.”A Treasury spokesman said: “Russia’s devastating invasion of Ukraine will have a huge impact on lives and livelihoods around the world and the effects will be felt across this country.“It is right that we do all we can to show solidarity with the people of Ukraine and work with our allies and partners to impose the most punishing sanctions to inflict maximum and lasting pain on Russia.“We know people are concerned about the cost of living, but we are already providing support worth over £ billion this financial year and next, including targeted support for energy bills, cutting the universal credit taper rate to help those on low incomes keep more of what they earn, and freezes to alcohol and fuel duties to keep costs down.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Nearly half of children living below  uacceptable standard u by April  u report article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe romance gap, a term coined by Bumble, is a term for the disparity between men and women and our expectations of the genders when it comes to relationships and dating.% of respondents believed men are still expected to make the first move, according to a YouGov poll that was commissioned by Bumble.Almost  in  people in the UKsaid they expect men to take the lead but only % expected the same from women.Bumbles latest research suggests that daters want a very dferent kind of relationship dynamic.% of Brits say that equality is important between people who are dating or in a relationship.Meanwhile, % of respondents said that there are dferent expectations and expected behaviours depending on your gender when it comes to relationships.                                                                                                            :  Best Dating Sites in the UK to Find that Special Someone: Tinder is introducing a new security feature for users - is it coming to the UK                                                                                                            In other words, an overwhelming majority believe that there is a romance gap and that there are pressures for men and women to act a certain way.The dating app recognises that we have made \"positive strides towards equality, traditional gender roles and expectations are still very present, and even, accepted in dating\".In fact, some behaviours that we deem romantic for men are viewed negativelythey come from a woman.The research, which collected responses from across Europe, found that:.removeMen are still expected to take the lead: Over half of peoplestate that society expects men to take the lead in relationships, rising to almost  in  in the UK , whilst a mere % think society expects women to do so. For men, just over  in feel pressured to take the lead.Women should not appear desperate: In the UK, more than halfstate women are expected to avoid appearing too keen, clingy, attached or desperate. Interestingly this is felt signicantly more by womenthan men .Men worry about their lack of experience between the sheets: Nearly a fthof British men are concerned about being judged for their lack of sexual experience. Almost the same amount of womenfear they’ll be judged for the opposite - their number of intimate encounters. Women have a ‘shelf-le’ in dating: % state that women are expected to prioritise finding a relationship and settle down before they are ‘too old’. In contrast, only % say that society expects this of men. For women,  in have felt pressure to compromise on what they want while dating or in relationships. Men are expected to be the breadwinners: In the UK,  in say men are expected to earn more money and be responsible for finances, with only % agreeing this is expected of women.  in women have felt concerned of being judged for earning more than their partner. Women are changing their behaviour: Amidst all these expectations, it’s no surprise that  in women have changed their behaviour to make someone feel more powerful or comfortable. A couple on a date. Credit: Canva The new campaign forms part of Bumble’s efforts to empower people to create healthy and equitable relationships and combat \"outdated\" gender dynamics.“The Romance Gap is a new term, but many of us will know the feeling. Those moments of questioningsending that text makes you appear too keen, waiting for them to take the lead, or worryingyou are being judged for being too keen, too inexperienced, too old. At Bumble, we are focused on creating an app that empowers women to make the first move and date on their own terms from the beginning. But we alone cannot change societal expectations,\" Naomi Walkland, Bumble’s VP for Europe said.Ms Walkland continued: “An unexamined Romance Gap limits us, with  in  people agreeing that it makes it dficult to build equal relationships. The only way to reduce the Romance Gap is to acknowledge it exists and start an open conversation about how it impacts how we see ourselves, our partners, and relationships. Only when we are aware of it can we challenge each other to do away with gendered expectations of who should do what.”Its not just that the outdated genre dynamics are bad for equality, they stop us from making genuine connections with people, the dating app believes.According to its research, % say the impact of gender roles makes people behave in a way that is less true to who they are.It does appear though that change is on its way with % of respondents believing that in an ideal world we would not have expectations on who earns more, a more successful career , or who makes the first move by initiating a date .You can see the rest of Bumbles research, campaign and tips on striking up a conversation via the Bumble website."},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/penarth_news/resources/images/13569145.jpg","title":"penarth news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Rev David ClarkeThe help they obtained there led to the successful rescue of the entire crew. Central to that mission was the heroic Tom Crean, from Anaschaul in Kerry’s Dingle peninsula.Tom Crean was an accidental polar explorer. He had joined the Royal Navy and  found himself on naval duties in New Zealand. At that time, Captain Robert Falcon Scott’s ship ‘Discovery’ was heading south on a reconnaissance mission. While docked for repairs in New Zealand, a member of Scott’s crew deserted and the Captain saw in Crean some of the qualities needed for the arduous challenges ahead. Some years later Crean was among the party that accompanied Scott on his ill-fated expedition to the South Pole, although he was not chosen to form part of the group for the last push to the Pole. Scott, of course, discovered that the Norwegian Amundsen had got there first. When Scott’swas delayed, Crean led the group that found Scott and his colleagues dead in their tents.When Shackleton came to make his own expedition he already knew the admirable qualities of the Kerryman. Even after their terrying voyage in mountainous seas to arrive on South Georgia, these seamen had to become mountaineers, for they discovered they had to cross a mountain range over , feet high to get to the whaling station. When they eventually arrived, they were barely recognisable as human beings.When Shackleton came to write of that episode he recorded that he had the strange feeling that there were not three men on that journey, but four. He said nothing to the other two, but one of them remarked to him, ‘Boss, I had the curious feeling on the march that there was another person with us.’ And apparently the third man said the same thing.The Old Testament book of Psalms includes a cluster of ‘Songs of Ascents’, songs sung by pilgrims ascending to Jerusalem for Passover. The most famous of them celebrates God’scare, and includes the promise, ‘The sun will not harm you by day nor the moon by night’. The peril of sunstroke in the blistering sun is obvious enough, but the reference to the moon may refer to mental distress, for it is from the word for moon that we derive the word ‘lunacy’. In any event, the reference is to God’s comprehensive care, by day and night.
