As many as 700,000 end up littering the streets across Britain every day.By contrast, recycling rates of more than nine in ten are achieved in other European countries with full deposit return schemes, such as Norway and Germany.Scotland\u0027s Environment Secretary, Roseanna Cunningham, said: \u0027There is a global climate emergency and people across Scotland have been calling, rightly, for more ambition to tackle it and safeguard our planet for future generations.          Campaigners called on the Environment Secretary Michael Gove (pictured in Westminster on Tuesday) as well as the authorities in Wales and Northern Ireland, to follow suit\u0027I am therefore delighted to confirm that I intend to implement a system covering PET - the most common form of plastic packaging - aluminium and steel cans, and glass, with a deposit refund set at 20p.\u0027Our plans for Scotland\u0027s Deposit Return Scheme are gathering pace with widespread consensus demonstrating that a well-run, appropriately-targeted scheme could improve the environment, change attitudes to recycling and litter, and support a more circular economy.\u0027 Significantly, the Scottish government has rejected lobbying from the plastics and retail industry to limit its DRS regime to small, \u0027on the go\u0027, plastic bottles and cans.         Pubs, hotels, cafes and fast food chains which sell drinks by the bottle or can will have to pay the 20p deposit and it will be up to them whether they pass it on to the public.The Chief Operating Officer of Zero Waste Scotland, Jill Farrell, described the DRS plan as a \u0027game changer\u0027.\u0027By giving people an extra incentive to do something good for our environment...we are confident it will be easier for all of us to do the right thing. This will improve the volume and quality of recycling and help tackle litter in the process,\u0027 she said.The news is a vindication of the Daily Mail\u0027s efforts to highlight the dangers of plastic waste dating back more than ten years, including the Take Back Your Bottles and Turn the Tide on Plastic campaigns.The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) said the Westminster government, which is consulting on introducing DRS in England, should use the Scottish plan as a template and, potentially, go even further.Its litter programme director, Samantha Harding, said: \u0027By introducing a deposit return system for glass, plastic and metal drinks containers it has taken a significant step in tackling the problem of packaging pollution - one that has resulted in devastating consequences for our countryside and environment for far too long.\u0027 Oceans expert for Greenpeace, Willie Mackenzie, said: \u0027This is a practical solution to stop material like plastic being thrown away and ending up in our rivers and oceans.\u0027Crucially Scotland\u0027s scheme will be far-reaching and include glass bottles, which is what the public supports and will drastically boost recycling collection rates. The government in Westminster must now follow suit without delay.\u0027 The decision by the Scottish government to include glass in the scheme is controversial because it will drive up the costs. However, campaigners were worried that drinks firms might try to escape the new 20p fee by switching to using glass.The decision means that the cost of dealing with all the drinks containers is passed to manufacturers and retailers, rather than being carried by local authorities and the public through council tax bills.Polling by the Marine Conservation Society shows that 72 per cent of people think the DRS should cover all sizes of drinks container and 60 per cent believe it should include plastic, glass bottles and aluminium cans.Its chief executive, Sandy Luk, said: \u0027Michael Gove must listen to what consumers want.\u0027The rest of the UK must follow the Scottish Government\u0027s lead to ensure we have the best systems in place across the UK. \u0027We need to have compatible schemes so that there is no confusion among consumers and so that we can increase recycling and help reduce the tide of glass and plastic bottles and cans blighting our shores and seas.\u0027 The British Retail Consortium, which speaks for supermarkets, said: \u0027A successful DRS, working within a wider comprehensive strategy to reduce waste could herald an opportunity to drive further increases in recycling and reduce litter, over and above the existing kerbside system.\u0027 However, the organisation as well as the Wine \u0026amp Spirits Trade Association argued against including glass in the scheme on the basis it would increase costs and create a health and safety risk. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/06/19/13163490-0-image-m-5_1557168328414.jpg","title":"Britain goes week without burning coal electricity","story":"Share this article Sean Kemp, a spokesman for the National Grid, told The Daily Telegraph: \u0027We broke the record this weekend for the longest period of time without coal.

He appeared to be in denial, telling people that he wasn\u0027t shaking so he couldn\u0027t have Parkinson\u0027s.His attitude changed as the condition took over his body and he began to think that God gave the disease to him for a reason.Ali said: \u0027The Quran says that you have to be humble to enter the gates of heaven. I have the most recognizable face in the world. People are always catering to me.\u0027I can drop a pen on the floor and everyone rushes to pick it up for me.

As many as 700,000 end up littering the streets across Britain every day.By contrast, recycling rates of more than nine in ten are achieved in other European countries with full deposit return schemes, such as Norway and Germany.Scotland\u0027s Environment Secretary, Roseanna Cunningham, said: \u0027There is a global climate emergency and people across Scotland have been calling, rightly, for more ambition to tackle it and safeguard our planet for future generations.          Campaigners called on the Environment Secretary Michael Gove (pictured in Westminster on Tuesday) as well as the authorities in Wales and Northern Ireland, to follow suit\u0027I am therefore delighted to confirm that I intend to implement a system covering PET - the most common form of plastic packaging - aluminium and steel cans, and glass, with a deposit refund set at 20p.\u0027Our plans for Scotland\u0027s Deposit Return Scheme are gathering pace with widespread consensus demonstrating that a well-run, appropriately-targeted scheme could improve the environment, change attitudes to recycling and litter, and support a more circular economy.\u0027 Significantly, the Scottish government has rejected lobbying from the plastics and retail industry to limit its DRS regime to small, \u0027on the go\u0027, plastic bottles and cans.         Pubs, hotels, cafes and fast food chains which sell drinks by the bottle or can will have to pay the 20p deposit and it will be up to them whether they pass it on to the public.The Chief Operating Officer of Zero Waste Scotland, Jill Farrell, described the DRS plan as a \u0027game changer\u0027.\u0027By giving people an extra incentive to do something good for our environment...we are confident it will be easier for all of us to do the right thing. This will improve the volume and quality of recycling and help tackle litter in the process,\u0027 she said.The news is a vindication of the Daily Mail\u0027s efforts to highlight the dangers of plastic waste dating back more than ten years, including the Take Back Your Bottles and Turn the Tide on Plastic campaigns.The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) said the Westminster government, which is consulting on introducing DRS in England, should use the Scottish plan as a template and, potentially, go even further.Its litter programme director, Samantha Harding, said: \u0027By introducing a deposit return system for glass, plastic and metal drinks containers it has taken a significant step in tackling the problem of packaging pollution - one that has resulted in devastating consequences for our countryside and environment for far too long.\u0027 Oceans expert for Greenpeace, Willie Mackenzie, said: \u0027This is a practical solution to stop material like plastic being thrown away and ending up in our rivers and oceans.\u0027Crucially Scotland\u0027s scheme will be far-reaching and include glass bottles, which is what the public supports and will drastically boost recycling collection rates. The government in Westminster must now follow suit without delay.\u0027 The decision by the Scottish government to include glass in the scheme is controversial because it will drive up the costs. However, campaigners were worried that drinks firms might try to escape the new 20p fee by switching to using glass.The decision means that the cost of dealing with all the drinks containers is passed to manufacturers and retailers, rather than being carried by local authorities and the public through council tax bills.Polling by the Marine Conservation Society shows that 72 per cent of people think the DRS should cover all sizes of drinks container and 60 per cent believe it should include plastic, glass bottles and aluminium cans.Its chief executive, Sandy Luk, said: \u0027Michael Gove must listen to what consumers want.\u0027The rest of the UK must follow the Scottish Government\u0027s lead to ensure we have the best systems in place across the UK. \u0027We need to have compatible schemes so that there is no confusion among consumers and so that we can increase recycling and help reduce the tide of glass and plastic bottles and cans blighting our shores and seas.\u0027 The British Retail Consortium, which speaks for supermarkets, said: \u0027A successful DRS, working within a wider comprehensive strategy to reduce waste could herald an opportunity to drive further increases in recycling and reduce litter, over and above the existing kerbside system.\u0027 However, the organisation as well as the Wine \u0026amp Spirits Trade Association argued against including glass in the scheme on the basis it would increase costs and create a health and safety risk. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/06/19/13163490-0-image-m-5_1557168328414.jpg","title":"Britain goes week without burning coal electricity","story":"Share this article Sean Kemp, a spokesman for the National Grid, told The Daily Telegraph: \u0027We broke the record this weekend for the longest period of time without coal.

They object to  trees being cut down to make space for a wider road and bus lane. Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill Residents in a community in Dublin’s south inner city have said they are willing to limit private cars locally and increase their use of public transport in order to save trees. Over 70 residents from Inchicore have written to the National Transport Authority (NTA) in relation to the BusConnects proposals stating they are willing to “sacrifice convenience” and increase their usage of public transport, cycling and walking “so that we can save our green spaces”. Under the NTA’s proposed Liffey Valley to city centre corridor, some of the trees on Grattan Crescent in Inchicore would have to be removed to accommodate an additional bus lane. In a submission to the NTA residents from the Woodfield area said saving trees at Grattan Crescent was their “number one priority”, and have proposed a one-way system for private motorists on the road “as a compromise”.Residents said they are willing to support the bulk of the plans along with some amendments, but that “mature trees are an irreplaceable feature of our locality”. BusConnects aims to overhaul the current bus system in the Dublin region by creating 230km of dedicated bus lanes and 200km of cycle tracks along 16 of the busiest corridors along with a redesign of the network.Over 1,400 properties stand to lose part of their front gardens to accommodate the plans, while more than 1,600 trees and 700 parking spaces would be lost. The NTA said where trees were removed “a comprehensive replanting programme” would be put in place. Alternative optionsLauren Tuite has been living in the Woodfield estate on the Sarsfield Road with her husband and their nine-month-old baby since March. She said she and residents met with the NTA to discuss alternative options under the proposed plans. “I went home and wrote a letter to all of my neighbours and distributed it, making an argument for why we should have a one-way system and lose our direct access to the village by car. I was expecting people to be very much opposed to it but people starting ringing and saying can we have a meeting about it,” she told The . “We had two meetings and a lot of discussion about how difficult it would make life for some people, not being able to access crèche facilities by car and discussed ‘well is it worth walking your children if we can save the trees’.”Ms Tuite said residents came to a consensus they would favour a one-way system for private vehicles if it meant the trees would remain. She wrote up a submission to the NTA with the local residents’ alternative proposal, which has been signed by over 70 people from the area. “It’s just a lovely part of Inchicore, and it would just be such a loss to lose those trees,” said Ms Tuite."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3884170.1557256045!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain and ireland to sign common travel area deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSimon Coveney and David Lidington will sign the agreement in London on Wednesday ahead of a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council.

File photograph: Getty The cost of the National Broadband Plan, including private investment, is now expected to exceed € 5 billion, it has emerged.And despite paying the bulk of the cost, €3 billion, the Government will not own the network once built. Typically in public-private partnerships, the asset reverts to the State after the contract expires.“When taking the overall cost of this into account before revenues the estimated total project cost is estimated to be circa €5 billion, exclusive of VAT, over the first 25 years,” a Department of Communications spokesman confirmed to The  on Wednesday. The €5 billion figure implies the preferred bidder – a consortium led by US businessman David McCourt – is investing €2 billion in the project.A storm of Opposition protest and criticism greeted the Government’s National Broadband Plan on Wednesday as official documents revealed the extent of objections to the project by senior civil servants.Opposition leaders demanded that the Dáil be adjourned to allow time to examine the documents released and returned later to voice fierce criticism of the plan and the Government’s handling of it. Privately, some Ministers expressed astonishment at the vehemence of official objections to the proposal.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald demanded to know how much the preferred bidder is investing in the project. They noted the fact that Mr McCourt’s consortium would own the network at the completion of the 25-year contract. But Minister for Communications Richard Bruton refused to release the figure, saying it was commercially sensitive. The released documents reveal a furious behind-the-scenes battle between officials in the Departments of Public Expenditure and Communications.The Department of Public Expenditure raised concerns about the project over a period of months and despite efforts by the Department of Communications to assuage these worries, objections by officials who oversee public spending only hardened. The process culminated in the Department of Public Expenditure including its forceful objections in Cabinet documentation last weekend, despite the fact that the Minister, Paschal Donohoe, did not share his department’s views.While the Department of Communications insisted that its cost-benefit analysis demonstrated a strong case for the project, the Department of Public Expenditure dismissed this as “not credible”.Will public projects be cancelled?Department of Public Expenditure officials also suggested the State was investing most of the money and assuming most of the risk, while a private company would garner many of the benefits. The department also advised that other capital projects – and it listed a series of specific schemes including roads, schools and social housing – would have to be postponed or cancelled to find the money for the broadband project.But Mr Donohoe later said no projects would be cancelled and the Government would find more money for the broadband plan. He said he believed “on balance this is the right thing for us to do”.Speaking last night in the Netherlands, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the plan was “a leap of faith in believing in the future of rural Ireland”. He also said he had confidence in Robert Watt, the secretary general of the Department of Public Expenditure, who advised against proceeding with the plan."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3885285.1557335252!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"israeli envoy says calls for eurovision boycott cross a line","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSarah McTernan will represent Ireland in the Eurovision  in Tel Aviv. Photograph: Lili ForbergIsrael’s ambassador to Ireland, Ophir Kariv, is horrified that there should be calls from Irish pro-Palestinian supporters for a boycott of the Eurovision song context in Tel Aviv next week.For the Israeli career diplomat, just six months in his first posting as an ambassador, calling for a boycott in protest over Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands would score “nul points” in Tel Aviv.It crossed a line, he said.As Mr Kariv sees it, sitting in his official residence near RTÉ’s campus in Dublin, boycotts should have no place in relations between two democratic countries.“I don’t think boycotts should be in our tool box. We should have many other means for communication and for expressing our views and for debating. We may agree we may disagree,” he said, ahead of Yom Ha’atzmaut on Thursday, the day that marks Israeli independence in 1948.Mr Kariv dismissed the boycott led by the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign – and backed by the likes of musicians such as Christy Moore and former Eurovision winner Charlie McGettigan – as “a small minority” and estimated that many more Irish people would actually watch the song contest.“This is a group that, not for the first time, tries to hijack the agenda of public discourse and of events, whether they are cultural or commercial, in order to promote their anti-Israel agenda,” he said.“The Eurovision is a cultural event and this is how it should be looked at,” he said.The ambassador accepted that many people in Ireland were sympathetic to the Palestinian cause and conceded that this did not amount to being anti-Israeli.‘Extreme’ minorityHe believed, however, that there was a small, “very extreme” minority who could create “an atmosphere of almost intimidation towards everyone who dares think about any co-operation with Israel or Israelis”, he said.He argued those who called for a boycott of the Eurovision were crossing a thin line between being pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli.“As much as I am aware of the criticism in Ireland of Israel’s policies and criticism, when it is real criticism, it is quite legitimate. There is a very thin line between being pro-Palestinian and support of Palestinians and being anti-Israel. It is too easily and too often being crossed,” he said.Mr Kariv insisted that this was not just an excuse thrown out to avoid listening to concerns about how Palestinians were treated by Israel. He was happy to sit down and debate with people opposite him who were “sometimes critical of the Israeli position and policies” but calling for a boycott was different.“A small group of extremists calling for a boycott means no communication whatsoever I think this is dangerous to Ireland at least as much as it is dangerous for Israel,” he said.He believes the Government’s handling of relations with Israelis and Palestinians is an example of how to be supportive of the Palestinian cause and being considerate to their needs and plight “while not becoming anti-Israel”.The diplomat described the Occupied Territories Bill which aims to ban products from Israeli settlements deemed illegal under international law as “the most extreme anti-Israel piece of legislation in the western world”.The legislation passed the Dáil in January and is at committee stage but has been opposed by the Government.“There is nothing like it,” said Mr Kariv.He warned, ominously, that if the legislation was enacted, it “will have implications”, but he declined to say what they were, beyond it hampering relations between the Irish and Israeli people.“It is not only a political issue. The implications of this Bill touch upon history, national identity and very, very deep issues and one must be very careful when it deals with those,” he said.He dismissed media speculation around budgetary cuts at home in Israel that it might consider closing its embassy in Dublin in response.Security precautionsThe tight security precautions around the Israeli ambassador in leafy Dublin 4 show the country’s fears for its envoy in Ireland.He met The  days after Hamas – the militant movement that controls Gaza – and Islamic Jihad fired almost 700 rockets and mortars at Israeli from the Gaza Strip, killing at least four Israelis. Retaliatory strikes carried out by the Israelis killed at least 25 Palestinians. The violence flared up last Friday during a protest against the blockade of Gaza.Mr Kariv differentiated between ordinary Gazans and militants in Gaza, saying that Israeli military tried to be “as precise and as surgical as possible” when it attempted to target only militants in airstrikes, but he suggested that hitting only military targets was not always possible.In Ireland, Mr Kariv tries to offer a more measured approach to relations with his Irish hosts compared with the past. In 2014, the Israeli embassy controversially – and briefly – posted a picture showing the Molly Malone statue in full Muslim dress above a caption: “Israel is the last frontier of the free world.”This envoy is keen to “keep the conversation open”, engaging in debate with people who disagree with the Israeli position to try to win over critics.“I haven’t been turned down by anyone,” he said. “We should know how to manage our differences.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3885573.1557351421!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord who dares question the rural broadband plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRichard ‘Ask  Me Anything’ Bruton wouldn’t answer the one big question they all wanted to ask: how much is Granahan McCourt putting up?

There wasn’t much laughing when Michael Ring blew his gasket.“I’m all for broadband in rural Ireland,” he roared again.“So are we but the Government cannot deliver it,” retorted Fianna Fáil’s Thomas Byrne.Fine Gael seemed to be making a concerted effort to burnish its great concern for rural Ireland in the face of uncaring opposition. Yet the one area of consensus in the Dáil was everyone’s desire for decent national broadband as soon as possible. While strongly questioning the Government’s plan, speakers on all sides – rural and urban – were at pains to stress they are most definitely not against its provision.There were charges that this sudden rush to announce the plan – even though the Minister for Communications, Richard Bruton, admitted the nitty-gritty hasn’t been “nailed down” and a contract won’t be signed anytime soon – was more to do with getting the message out before the local and European elections.Could they be that cynical?There was a theory doing the rounds that as soon as the elections are over, the negotiations will collapse.We met a Government backbencher from a rural constituency.“I’ve been on the doors in the last few weeks,” said the TD. “The one thing that keeps coming up is the broadband. It’s all they ask about on the doorsteps. It’s the big issue in the rural areas.” Then he recited how much the Government has allocated for the roll-out of broadband in his bailiwick.‘Equal access’Coincidentally, Michael D’Arcy, Minister of State at the Department of Finance, tweeted soon afterwards: “€81 million is being invested in County Wexford over the next 25 years to bring broadband to 82,500 homes, farms and businesses. This plan is about equal access to services and opportunities for everyone, no matter where they live and work.”He appended a table of figures which showed a county-by-county allocation of funds, even though the scheme has just been announced.Rural broadband has leapt to the top of the pecking order for State money, although that particular summit is nearly as crowded now as the top of Croagh Patrick on Reek Sunday. There is always room at the top for another billion-dollar project when the urgent political need arises.So even if the Government has decided to probably commit a potential €3 billion in a secret deal with an American investment outfit to deliver broadband to the farthest corners of the country, this will not have a negative impact on badly needed projects already promised funding from the State purse.There is no need to fear cuts in other, already constrained, areas such as education, health and housing. The Government is not in the business of dashing expectations at this important time in the political calendar. Rest assured, soothe all the Ministers, money will be found down the back of the Magic Sofa to pay for everything.Tuesday’s cabinet decision to bite the broadband bullet and throw in its lot with the sole bidder willing to take on the task of rolling out a high-speed network nationwide was met with a chorus of opposition when the Dáil resumed after the May bank holiday break.Inglorious pastState involvement with the telecommunications business has an inglorious past.The scandal over the awarding of the second mobile phone licence to Denis O’Brien’s Esat Digifone company is still invoked when licensing matters are discussed in the Dáil.A controversy over huge cost overruns in CIÉ during the installation of a centralised railway signalling system led to an Oireachtas inquiry in 2001. Esat also played a major part in that story, with questions arising from its deal with CIÉ to lay fibre-optic cables along the rail network at the same time as the signalling work.The investigation was abandoned following the Abbeylara court judgement on the powers of Oireachtas inquiries.The overrun in 2001 was nothing compared to the ongoing situation about escalating costs for the new children’s hospital in Dublin.Given the less than shining record when it comes to implementing major national projects, it is no surprise that the Opposition wants to see the financial detail underpinning the Government’s decision to support US private company Granahan McCourt’s plan to install the broadband network. The surprise is that the Government thinks it can proceed without providing it.The Taoiseach wasn’t in the Dáil on Wednesday to answer their questions. Normally, this would lead to bitter complaints from across the floor, but not in this instance because the Minister deputising for him was the Minister in charge of broadband – Richard Bruton.It’s his baby, he had to own it.Utterly transparentRichard “Ask Me Anything” Bruton was happy to deal with any queries on the matter. He said he was willing to answer questions at any time because he wanted to be utterly transparent at all times.The Government says it will put €3 billion into the pot to ensure the project proceeds as quickly and efficiently as possible. How much is Granahan McCourt putting up?Ask Me Anything Bruton wouldn’t answer the one big question they all wanted to ask.How much? How much money is the private company putting on the line?Ask Me Anything was very sorry but, “in terms of the sum of the equity involved, I am not going to prejudice the final signing-off on a contract . . . by revealing a figure that, as deputies can see from the redacted documents, is a confidential figure.”Right enough, just because something is blacked out doesn’t make it confidential. Anybody can put a line of black marker through a figure or a sentence. It doesn’t make it confidential – it just means you own a black marker.The thing that Richard wanted to make clear, and his colleagues fully support him, is that “as a Government, we are not prepared to see rural Ireland left behind.”This provoked snorts of derision from across the floor in a “what’s seldom is wonderful” kind of way.As Fine Gael squirmed, it was put again and again that the commercial sensitivity argument doesn’t stack up when the tender process is over and there are no competitors.“We have quite a few months ahead of us before we actually sign the contract,” said a haunted Minister for Finance on the Six One news.Broadband must come, but will this be the way?"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3885427.1557342953!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may agrees to discuss future with tory backbenchers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May at the dispatch box on Wednesday, May 8th:  ‘We are working on an agreement that can command a majority of this House.’ Photograph: UK ParliamentRoger Harrisvia Reuters British prime minister Theresa May has agreed to meet Conservative backbenchers next week to discuss her future amid pressure for her to set out a definite timetable for departure. But Downing Street made clear that the prime minister had no intention of resigning before her Brexit deal is approved by parliament.“She made a very generous and bold offer to the 1922 committee a few weeks ago that she would see through phase one of the Brexit process and she would leave and open it up for new leadership for phase two and that is the timetable she’s working towards. She wants to get Brexit done. She has been clear that she will stay to the completion of phase one,” said a spokesman.In the House of Commons on Wednesday, Conservative backbencher Andrea Jenkyns called on Mrs May to leave immediately.“She’s tried her best, nobody could fault or doubt her commitment and sense of duty, but she has failed. The public no longer trust her to run Brexit negotiations. Isn’t it time to step aside and let someone else lead our country, our party and the Brexit negotiations?” said Ms Jenkyns. The prime minister said that Brexit was not about her but that if all MPs had voted the way she did, Britain would have left the EU by now. Chairman of the 1922 committee chairman Graham Brady said backbenchers would have a chance to discuss the issue with Mrs May next week. He added that he expected her to introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill soon.“It’s my understanding it’s the government’s intention to bring a second reading of the Bill forward in the near future, certainly the intention is before the European election takes place. Personally I hope the Bill will be brought forward in a form which contains elements of the political declaration brought forward that would obviate the need ever for the Irish backstop to apply,” he said.Any progress in Labour-Tory talks?Talks between the government and Labour continued on Wednesday night and during prime minister’s questions Mrs May defended her decision to enter negotiations with Jeremy Corbyn in an effort to find a common approach to Brexit.“We are indeed talking with the Labour Party. The public gave this House a very clear message last week – that they want us to get on and deliver Brexit. It is absolutely right that we do so and we are working on an agreement that can command a majority of this House,” she said.Labour said it would persist with the talks, but warned that the government would have to show a willingness to compromise within days if they were to succeed.“These talks are not an indefinite process. We are looking to nail down in the next few days whether and how the government is prepared to move from its failed deal,” said a spokesman.If the government fails to agree a common Brexit proposal with Labour, its Plan B is to put a number of options to MPs in indicative votes.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignChina\u0026#39s vow to retaliate rattles markets as Donald Trump says Beijing \u0026#39broke\u0026#39 trade talks dealComment: When will green zealots figure out that Britain cannot fight climate change alone?Delayed rail passengers asked to submit 24 pieces of information to claim compensation, study findsRSPB asks government to ensure developers build bird boxes into new homes amid fears swift numbers are plummeting The Brexit Party is ‘like Burger King -

Managing Director of Public Markets said: “The technology exists to deliver compensation automatically, but the industry continues to drag its heels, while benefiting from a system that deters passengers from claiming the money they are owed.“It’s clear this fragmented and confusing compensation system leads to people losing out on a lot of money when they have already suffered enough from unacceptable levels of delays and cancellations.” 24 train companies required answers to between 10 and 24 questions before a claim could be submittedThe worst offenders for having complicated and lengthy claims processes were Greater Anglia, London Northwestern, ScotRail, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains - with each demanding 24 pieces of information.They include 13 about the ticket, seven on the journey and four personal questons.All five required passengers to submit 13 different pieces of information about their ticket that could be found clearly displayed on a photo of the paper ticket - which 23 out of 24 train companies require to be uploaded as proof of purchase.While passengers face seven questions about the journey in question plus four requests for personal information.Six train companies asked people to provide the ‘from and to’ journey details more than once within the same form, forcing them to input the journey they took twice.As many as 14 out of 24 train companies also asked passengers to dig out even more detailed ticket information, such as the ticket reference number. Half of train companies also asked passengers why they were making a claim or the reason for the delay - the latter being information the train company is better placed to answer and should already hold.When the train companies were asked why they wanted this level of detail responses included deterring fraudulent claims, that it was needed for paper tickets without reservations, the prominence of third party retailers and that customers could set up an online account and store their personal details to make claims easier second time round.  To simplify the compensation process Which? is calling for the government’s rail review to ensure that fully automatic compensation for delays and cancellations is introduced across the network as soon as possible.Several train companies - including C2C, Northern, South Western Railway and Virgin Trains - already offer automatic compensation to customers with certain tickets meaning passengers are automatically refunded without any cumbersome form-filling.China\u0026#39s vow to retaliate rattles markets as Donald Trump says Beijing \u0026#39broke\u0026#39 trade talks dealComment: When will green zealots figure out that Britain cannot fight climate change alone?RSPB asks government to ensure developers build bird boxes into new homes amid fears swift numbers are plummeting The Brexit Party is ‘like Burger King - it’s home of the Whopper\u0026#39, Rachel Johnson tells Chopper\u0026#39s Brexit Podcast  The rise of the modern family: record numbers of gay couples and single women opt for IVF  Juan Guaido\u0026#39s deputy arrested and dragged away by tow truck in VenezuelaAttorney General William Barr faces being held in contempt of Congress amid showdown with TrumpDonald Trump Jr subpoenaed by Congressional committee in Russia probeAll hail the Aldi Prince: Anglo-Saxon royal burial site unearthed near Essex store is \u0026#39Britain\u0026#39s Tutankhamun\u0026#39Hope for multiple sclerosis sufferers after green light for drug which can delay wheelchair use by seven yearsMove power sockets higher to survive flooding, says environment chiefMP Johnny Mercer goes on strike until Theresa May protects veterans from historic prosecutions Brexit latest news: Theresa May wins stay of execution, but Tory rebels lose patienceEurope hints at sanctions while urging Iran to rethink nuclear deal departureFour Scottish MPs repeatedly have official credit cards suspended for failing to pay back moneyBrexit: Behind Closed Doors, review – an excruciating look at how the EU scorned Theresa May’s Brexit effortsMike Pompeo exclusive: Secretary of State warns UK special relationship will cool if US fails to get Iran supportComment: Without a massive campaign for free enterprise, a Corbynite calamity loomsBaby Archie Harrison: Duke and Duchess of Sussex announce royal baby boy\u0026#39s name – but no title One person seriously hurt and others injured after building collapsesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/health-fitness/2017/10/29/TELEMMGLPICT000144848113_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyuLFFzXshuGqnr8zPdDWXiTUh73-1IAIBaONvUINpkg.jpeg?i","title":"rise modern family record numbers gay couples single women opt","story":"Experts raise concerns that growing NHS rationing of IVF had turned it into a \u0026#39middle class procedure\u0026#39, only increasingly limited to the affluentRecord numbers of gay couples, single women and those using surrogates are opting for fertility treatment, new figures show.Official statistics from the UK fertility watchdog show the number of women seeking IVF with a female partner has risen eight-fold in the last decade, while the number ‘going it alone’ or using a surrogate has tripled.Meanwhile the number of women seeking to freeze their eggs has risen sharply, with a six-fold rise in just seven years.Experts said the findings reflected “the changing nature of family creation in the UK”.But they raised concern that growing NHS rationing of IVF had turned it into a “middle class procedure” that was only increasingly limited to the affluent.And they warned that the majority of women seeking egg freezing – in the hope of preserving their fertility – were waiting too long to do so.The report from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) shows a steep rise in the last decade across the UK in women outside heterosexual relationships seeking help to have a child.Between 2007 and 2017, IVF and donor insemination for women in female same-sex relationships rose five-fold, to 4,463 cases. The number receiving IVF rose eight-fold, from 249 to 1988 cases, while the number receiving donor insemination went from 693 to 2475 cases.Meanwhile there was a doubling in the number of single women receiving either form of fertility treatment, from 1,059 to 2,279 cases, including a more than tripling in the numbers having IVF.After four decades of IVF, what’s the future of fertility treatment?The same period saw a sharp rise in the number of IVF treatments involving surrogacy, with 302 cases in 2017 – a rise from 110 cases a decade before, with a rise of more than a fifth in the last year.Experts said the trend was likely to reflect a rise in the number of gay men seeking to build families using surrogacy, though the figures do not record this.The statistics show that in 2017, there were 1,462 egg freezing cycles – a six-fold rise from 234 in 2010, when records were first kept.Fertility experts expressed alarm that more than two thirds of cases involved women aged 35 and over, when success is more likely earlier.They included some 426 cycles were for women aged 35 to 37, while 313 were for those aged 38 to 39, 192 for those aged 40 to 42 and 42 for those aged 43 to 44. A further 10 cycles were for those over 44.  It follows warnings from Sally Cheshire, chairman of the HFEA,  that too many fertility clinics are exploiting older women by “trading on hope” and not being transparent enough about their chances of success.Today she said: We are seeing a gradual change in the reasons why people use fertility treatments, which were originally developed to help heterosexual couples with infertility problems.While the increases in same-sex couples, single women and surrogates having fertility treatment are small, this reflects society\u0027s changing attitudes towards family creation, lifestyles and relationships and highlights the need for the sector to continue to evolve and adapt.The legal low-down | Solicitor Nicola Scott’s advice for anyone thinking about surrogacyThe report found that the average age of a patient undergoing IVF is rising, from 33.5 in 1991 to 35.5 in 2017. While the steepest rises were seen among gay couples, single women and those using surrogacy, around nine in ten treatments involved heterosexual couples.The watchdog also highlighted differences in NHS funding for fertility treatment across the UK.While funding in Scotland and Northern Ireland has been increasing, and remains stable in Wales it has been falling in England.Currently, 62 per cent of treatment cycles are NHS-funded in Scotland, compared with just 35 per cent of those in England.Prof Allan Pacey, Professor of Andrology, University of Sheffield, said: “The report confirms the changing nature of family creation in the UK, with more women in same sex relationships and single women seeking treatment.“This echoes what we are seeing in clinics and I suspect there are also more gay males seeking to build families through surrogacy,” he said. “However, what is alarming to me is the shocking difference in NHS funded cycles across the four nations of the UK, with Scotland being the most generous and England being the least. This is really shameful and unfair.”Prof Joyce Harper, Professor in Human Genetics and Embryology, University College London also raised concerns about rationing.  She said: “Fertility treatment is turning into a middle class procedure, with the UK having some of the highest IVF costs in Europe.”Ms Sarah Norcross, Director, Progress Educational Trust (PET), said the differences between the different nations were “appalling”. She also expressed concern that more than two thirds of women freezing their eggs are over the age of 35, urging regulators to re-examine rules which put a 10 year limit on storage.China\u0026#39s vow to retaliate rattles markets as Donald Trump says Beijing \u0026#39broke\u0026#39 trade talks dealComment: When will green zealots figure out that Britain cannot fight climate change alone?Delayed rail passengers asked to submit 24 pieces of information to claim compensation, study findsRSPB asks government to ensure developers build bird boxes into new homes amid fears swift numbers are plummeting The Brexit Party is ‘like Burger King - it’s home of the Whopper\u0026#39, Rachel Johnson tells Chopper\u0026#39s Brexit Podcast  Juan Guaido\u0026#39s deputy arrested and dragged away by tow truck in VenezuelaAttorney General William Barr faces being held in contempt of Congress amid showdown with TrumpDonald Trump Jr subpoenaed by Congressional committee in Russia probeAll hail the Aldi Prince: Anglo-Saxon royal burial site unearthed near Essex store is \u0026#39Britain\u0026#39s Tutankhamun\u0026#39Hope for multiple sclerosis sufferers after green light for drug which can delay wheelchair use by seven yearsMove power sockets higher to survive flooding, says environment chiefMP Johnny Mercer goes on strike until Theresa May protects veterans from historic prosecutions Brexit latest news: Theresa May wins stay of execution, but Tory rebels lose patienceEurope hints at sanctions while urging Iran to rethink nuclear deal departureFour Scottish MPs repeatedly have official credit cards suspended for failing to pay back moneyBrexit: Behind Closed Doors, review – an excruciating look at how the EU scorned Theresa May’s Brexit effortsMike Pompeo exclusive: Secretary of State warns UK special relationship will cool if US fails to get Iran supportComment: Without a massive campaign for free enterprise, a Corbynite calamity loomsBaby Archie Harrison: Duke and Duchess of Sussex announce royal baby boy\u0026#39s name – but no title One person seriously hurt and others injured after building collapsesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/14/18/british-gas-1.jpg","title":"centrica british gas ceo iain conn pay package agm remuneration report pirc high pay centre","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Earlier this week the High Pay Centre attacked big shareholders for failing to act on excessive boardroom payClick to followThe IndependentBritish Gas owner Centrica is at the centre of a row over boss Iain Conn\u0027s payIs Centrica’s annual meeting going to provide another example of the failure of big institutional investors to act on excessive pay?The owner of British Gas is coming off a thoroughly miserable year. It angered consumers by imposing price increases, issued a profit warning, and announced thousands of job cuts. The performance of the shares, meanwhile, was miserable.\u0026nbspDespite all this, CEO Iain Conn saw his overall packaging rising to £2.4m from £1.7m thanks to bonuses, including an annual award and a payout from the long term incentive plan the company gave him.\u0026nbspBritish Gas owner’s stock falls to 20-year low after warning on profitBritish Gas owner Centrica will cut 1,000 jobs this yearNeedless to say, the rise has come in for considerable criticism. The latest to take a shot at it is Pirc, the voting adviser, which has urged shareholders to vote down the remuneration report at the forthcoming AGM.“The change in CEO total pay over five years is not commensurate with the change in TSR (total shareholder return) over the same period. Awards granted during the year under review were excessive at 250 per cent of salary,” it said in a report.\u0026nbspJust so. Quite how such a package can be seen as in any way in shareholders’ interests when shareholders\u0027 interests\u0026nbspin the company have so obviously been declining in value is beyond me.Pirc’s intervention is worth of note because it comes just a day after the High Pay Commission\u0026nbspsharply criticised Britain’s institutional investors for failing to curb excessive executive pay.\u0026nbspIt took a look at the rules that gave shareholders a veto on companies’ pay policy but failed to find an incidence of them actually using their power at a\u0026nbspFTSE 100 company.\u0026nbspOf 700 pay related resolutions in total, only 11 per cent attracted “significant” levels of dissent among 20 per cent or more of shareholders. Meanwhile, the median (most common) level of CEO pay in the FTSE reached £3.9m in 2017, 137 times that of the typical UK worker.

The catch is that the customer has to pay the fee regardless of whether their property is sold or not.\u0026nbspThe model has nonetheless rapidly gained traction in the UK, and the company’s successful marketing\u0026nbsprecently got it named on one of those “super brand” lists people like to put out.\u0026nbspLondon house prices fall at fastest pace since 2009Purplebricks founder and CEO Michael Bruce resignsPurplebricks to put its own house up for saleBut there’s nothing super about the way it has performed as an investment. Purplebricks joined the stock market at a quid in 2015 and backers\u0026nbspwere richly rewarded in the early days. The stock was touching a fiver within 18 months as investors got stars in their eyes over the plans by Bruce and his team to take the brand global.\u0026nbspBut the shares hit a bump in the road when stockbroker Jeffries last year issued a sharply critical research note, questioning the company’s sales success rates, and describing selling with it as “a £1,000 coin toss”, a reference to the fees which top that in London post codes.\u0026nbspThe broker argued the model hadn’t been sufficiently tested and claimed that the shares were priced for “perfection”.\u0026nbspThe latter part of that has proved prescient given the less than perfect performance the company has put in. Chairman Paul Pindar issued what can only be described as a grovelling apology to its investors in the latest update.\u0026nbsp“We are very conscious that the group’s performance has been disappointing over the last 12 months and we sincerely apologise to shareholders for that,” he said.\u0026nbspHowever, Purplebricks denies that there is any problem with the model per se.\u0026nbspPindar rather put the blame for the company’s issues on trying to go global too fast and making some bad investments, or, as he put it, “we have also made sub-optimal decisions in allocating capital”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

We will learn from these errors and will not make them again.”Purplebricks bemoaned “increasingly challenging” conditions in Australia and confessed to “execution errors”, adding that returns from the nation are “not sufficient to justify continued investment”.It will now commence an “orderly run down” with immediate effect, pending closure.In the US, Purplebricks has put its operations under review.Brexit a major drag on UK housing market as demand slumpsAsking prices slashed by £26,000 as UK housing market slows downThe firm said: “Whilst good progress has been made in launching our brand across the US, the board has materially cut investment in marketing and other overheads to reduce expenditure to sustainable levels and begun a strategic review.”In February, Purplebricks warned over headwinds in the Australian housing market when it admitted that it does not expect to meet revenue forecasts for the year.In the US, the company cautioned that there has been a “slower-than-expected response” to its marketing initiative and it also does not expect US revenue to meet expectations.To compound matters, last month analysts downgraded the online estate agent and said it would have to raise fresh cash.Berenberg warned in a research note that the group should either give up on its international expansion plans or raise more funding as it slashed its rating from buy to sell.It cited a slowdown in Purplebricks’ core UK market, as well as tough conditions in Australia and the US.Purplebricks confirmed that it expects revenue to be within the £130m to £140m range it guided for in February and cash balances will be no lower than £62m.Shares in Purplebricks shed over 5 per cent\u0026nbspin morning trade to 127p.Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets, said: “The UK housing market has softened, prices are falling in Australia and cracking the US is proving very difficult.“It’s tried to expand a little bit too quickly, but clearly the market conditions in the UK and Australia have been less than favourable.“In fact, it’s got so bad in Australia that the company is pulling out. In the US it looks like it will materially scale back the business. Canada is better, but small. The focus will now be on Canada, where growth is good, and shoring up the core domestic market in the UK.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our expectation is that all brands we work with are aware of and actively engaging with the issues surrounding palm oil and deforestation.”Consumers have become increasingly aware\u0026nbspof the devastation linked to palm oil, prompting\u0026nbspretailers to seek to reduce their usage of the commodity, but so far progress has been limited.Last year, Iceland attracted attention by becoming the first UK supermarket to commit to removing\u0026nbsppalm oil from all of its own-brand lines.Iceland accused of still using palm oil – despite promising to stopIceland said it would achieve its goal by the end of 2018 but in January it emerged that 28 own-brand products containing palm oil were still on sale and the company had removed its label form 17 other lines.Around 600 branded products containing palm oil were still available at Iceland, the BBC found.Nestle, the world’s biggest food manufacturer, attracted firm criticism from environmental groups over claims made last week that 77 per cent of the commodities used in its products were deforestation-free.Richard George, Head of Forests at Greenpeace UK said the claim “wholly contradicts” very recent discussions that Greenpeace had with Nestle.“We know Nestle continues to trade with some of the world’s guiltiest suppliers when it comes to deforestation for palm oil, soya and cocoa,” Mr George said.“Without further explanation, we can only conclude that this is a blatant and embarrassing attempt by the company to deceive its customers and absolve all responsibility for its contribution to the destruction of the world’s forests.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We can’t succeed without them and thousands of people come into work at Uber every day focused on how to make their experience better, on and off the road.Whether it’s being able to track your earnings or stronger insurance protections, we’ll continue working to improve the experience for and with drivers.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

With iOS 12, which was shown off at its Worldwide Developers\u0027 Conference in June, it focused on improving performance rather than introducing new features, and will do some of the same this year.There will still be a host of new features across the operating system, including some features that were delayed from last year as part of the effort to clean up the operating system, the report claimed. It is\u0026nbsppossible that any features currently being worked on could actually be delayed until next year, or never released at all.The company is also already at work on iOS 14, which is scheduled to be released in 2020 and is codenamed Azul, Bloomberg reported. That will seize on the breakthrough new technologies that are expected to come with that year\u0027s phone, including 5G connections for increased wireless speed and new augmented reality features.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple has cancelled its AirPower wireless charging mat, which was slated as a way to charge numerous apple products at once India has claimed status as part of a super league of nations after shooting down a live satellite in a test of new missile technology5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

It will include a Dark Mode to allow people to flip the colours on the screen and view it more easily in the dark, as well as changes to the menus that show when opening and closing apps and navigating around the home screen.The company will also re-design the keyboard, according to the report. It could finally introduce the ability to swipe across the letters with one motion, rather than tapping out each inidual letter, which is already available on Android phones.Inidual apps will also get changes. Chief among them appears to be the Health app, which is intended to track your wellbeing – and will now get a new homepage that will show a better picture of activity through the day.Reminders, Screen Time, Mail, Home, Books, Maps\u0026nbspand iMessages will also get their own minor tweaks. The latter will be altered to work a little more like WhatsApp, allowing people to make profiles and include their picture, which will show it to everyone.The Find My Friends and Find My iPhone apps will also get updates. That could allow them to serve as a hub for small physical beacons that can be attached to items, so they can be tracked if they are lost, previous reports have suggested.There will also be updates aimed specifically at the iPad. It will have new ways of multi-tasking and showing information on the home screen, as well as the ability to look at two different versions of the same app.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

New versions of iOS are actually in development right through the summer – and even after that, through further updates.New iPhone software update leaks, showing variety of new featuresThe full version usually arrives at the same time as the new iPhone. That comes some time towards the end of September, and there\u0027s no reason to think it\u0027ll be any different this year.Traditionally, the beta is released straight after the announcement concludes. Only developers can download it at first,\u0026nbspthough there are occasionally ways to get it onto your phone even if it isn\u0027t registered.A few weeks after that, the public beta usually opens. At that point, users can sign up and get their hands on the software – though it can often be buggy, and Apple asks you to provide feedback in return for the early access, it can be an exciting if risky way of getting a look before anybody else.Many of the features that are said to be coming to the operating system have already been revealed in various leaks. Those rumours suggest that the upgrade could be relatively minor, at least in terms of spectacular features – allowing Apple another year to concentrate on improving stability and performance – but that there will be plenty of smaller upgrades to make using the iPhone and iPad a better experience.Perhaps the most eye-catching (or eye-resting) of the various updates is the addition of dark mode. That will allow users to invert the colours so that the phone is largely white-on-black, meaning that the screen should be less dazzling and helping to preserve the phone\u0027s battery.Plenty of Apple\u0027s own apps will get updates too.\u0026nbspReminders, Screen Time, Mail, Home, Books, Maps and iMessages\u0026nbspare all rumoured to be getting small tweaks.Perhaps the most significant of those will be the Health app, which will be given a more comprehensive today feature to allow users to see how their activity more quickly, as well as the addition of hearing health and period tracking capabilities.The iPad will also get its own upgrades, including changes to how users switch between apps and the option to use two versions of the same app at the same time.WWDC tends not to have a huge number of hardware announcements, and those there are tend to be Macs rather than iPhones. The iPhone gets its own event, in September, and Apple has more than enough going on at each event to blur the two.But iOS is always a hint at the future of the iPhone and all of the ecosystem around it. The features already rumoured – like the focus on health – is a hint\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We will learn from these errors and will not make them again.”Purplebricks bemoaned “increasingly challenging” conditions in Australia and confessed to “execution errors”, adding that returns from the nation are “not sufficient to justify continued investment”.It will now commence an “orderly run down” with immediate effect, pending closure.In the US, Purplebricks has put its operations under review.Brexit a major drag on UK housing market as demand slumpsAsking prices slashed by £26,000 as UK housing market slows downThe firm said: “Whilst good progress has been made in launching our brand across the US, the board has materially cut investment in marketing and other overheads to reduce expenditure to sustainable levels and begun a strategic review.”In February, Purplebricks warned over headwinds in the Australian housing market when it admitted that it does not expect to meet revenue forecasts for the year.In the US, the company cautioned that there has been a “slower-than-expected response” to its marketing initiative and it also does not expect US revenue to meet expectations.To compound matters, last month analysts downgraded the online estate agent and said it would have to raise fresh cash.Berenberg warned in a research note that the group should either give up on its international expansion plans or raise more funding as it slashed its rating from buy to sell.It cited a slowdown in Purplebricks’ core UK market, as well as tough conditions in Australia and the US.Purplebricks confirmed that it expects revenue to be within the £130m to £140m range it guided for in February and cash balances will be no lower than £62m.Shares in Purplebricks shed over 5 per cent\u0026nbspin morning trade to 127p.Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets, said: “The UK housing market has softened, prices are falling in Australia and cracking the US is proving very difficult.“It’s tried to expand a little bit too quickly, but clearly the market conditions in the UK and Australia have been less than favourable.“In fact, it’s got so bad in Australia that the company is pulling out. In the US it looks like it will materially scale back the business. Canada is better, but small. The focus will now be on Canada, where growth is good, and shoring up the core domestic market in the UK.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yi Qi\u0026nbspwas the first specimen to be found with bat-like wings.\u0026nbspAt least eight to ten species of dinosaurs at the time had feathered wings, but only two had membrane wings, said Dr Wang.\u0026nbspThe fossil record is not complete and the feathered wing is more widely distributed so I think they probably evolved earlier.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our expectation is that all brands we work with are aware of and actively engaging with the issues surrounding palm oil and deforestation.”Consumers have become increasingly aware\u0026nbspof the devastation linked to palm oil, prompting\u0026nbspretailers to seek to reduce their usage of the commodity, but so far progress has been limited.Last year, Iceland attracted attention by becoming the first UK supermarket to commit to removing\u0026nbsppalm oil from all of its own-brand lines.Iceland accused of still using palm oil – despite promising to stopIceland said it would achieve its goal by the end of 2018 but in January it emerged that 28 own-brand products containing palm oil were still on sale and the company had removed its label form 17 other lines.Around 600 branded products containing palm oil were still available at Iceland, the BBC found.Nestle, the world’s biggest food manufacturer, attracted firm criticism from environmental groups over claims made last week that 77 per cent of the commodities used in its products were deforestation-free.Richard George, Head of Forests at Greenpeace UK said the claim “wholly contradicts” very recent discussions that Greenpeace had with Nestle.“We know Nestle continues to trade with some of the world’s guiltiest suppliers when it comes to deforestation for palm oil, soya and cocoa,” Mr George said.“Without further explanation, we can only conclude that this is a blatant and embarrassing attempt by the company to deceive its customers and absolve all responsibility for its contribution to the destruction of the world’s forests.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That would be a material economic burden,” the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said.The study – the first into the impact of the mooted cross-party deal – was seized on by supporters of a fresh Brexit referendum as proof that a customs union must not be seen as a “soft option”.They pointed out the £13bn annual loss in Treasury spending power was greater than the cost of Labour’s flagship pledge to axe student tuition fees, which has been put at £11.2bn.May admits she could cave in to Labour demands for customs union“A customs union deal is not as\u0026nbspdamaging for our economy as a no-deal Brexit,” said Rachel Reeves, a Labour supporter of the People’s Vote campaign.“But it is a mistake to regard it as a soft option – let alone a fix-all for a political crisis that has its roots in promises that can’t be met, real costs that have been ignored.”Created with Sketch.Put It To The People march: Best of The Independent’s pictures Show all 24Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The report, for People’s Vote, comes as talks continue between Labour and the Conservatives, although the two sides remain far from agreement on a deal that could be put to the House of Commons.Labour is demanding a permanent customs union, as well as single market alignment, while the Tories have conceded only a temporary arrangement – possibly covering only goods and not services.Change UK’s old Twitter account ‘hijacked’ to post Brexit propagandaTheresa May’s rebrand of her deal failed. She won’t last past JuneLabour tanked in the north east because it gave no clarity over BrexitBut the NIESR predicted the cost of such a deal, after a decade, would be greater than the entire annual budget of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.Investment and productivity would be hit by “higher barriers to trade in services” and Britain would pay the price for lower immigration outside the single market.“We estimate that GDP per head would be around 2 per cent lower than it would have been had the UK stayed in the EU, equivalent to around £800 per person per annum in today’s prices,” its report said.Garry Young, the think tank’s director of macromodelling, added: “Leaving the EU for a customs union will make it more costly for the UK to trade with a large market on our doorstep, particularly in services, which make up 80 per cent of our economy.“We estimate that all regions will be adversely affected and that there will be fewer resources available to pay for public services.”The government has not modelled the impact of a customs union Brexit, but it did conclude Ms May’s Brexit proposals – now apparently dead – would cost 3.9 per cent of GDP after 15 years.Real wages, after inflation, were expected to be 2.7 per cent lower – despite the claims of Brexiteers that cutting EU migration would allow pay to go up.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s insane. ‘I don’t know, I haven’t spoken to her?’ That’s ridiculous. Pathetic, pathetic,” he says.The comments are in contrast to the EU’s diplomatic public approach to talks, throughout which they heaped praise on their counterparts such as Ms May and David Davis.On another occasion captured in the documentary, Edel Rettman-Crosse, Mr Verhofstadt’s top aide, describes the UK’s then Brexit secretary Mr Davis, who the team has just met with, as having his “head in the f***ing clouds”.The officials agreed that Mr Davis\u0026nbspdid not “really give a f**k” about the Irish border, one of the key issues\u0026nbspthat bogged down Brexit talks for months afterwards.“David Davis explained to us that Ireland is not a problem,” says an exasperated Mr\u0026nbspMcLaughlin, recounting the meeting. The Brexit deal has since been blocked by the UK parliament effectively over the Irish border question.Ms May’s conference speech also goes down poorly with the team, with Mr\u0026nbspMcLaughlin shouting “Oh, f**k\u0026nbspoff!” at the screen when the prime minister\u0026nbspclaims she is working hard to get a deal.The film also gives the impression of a Brussels that feels totally unthreatened by the UK, with regular mocking doled out at the UK’s expense.Over breakfast in one scene, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Barnier end up discussing classic cars, and Mr Barnier jokes: “That’s what they’re trying to do with Brexit, take an old car and restore it.Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentElmar Brok, a German ally of Angela Merkel who sits on the Brexit steering group, says the EU should not help the UK sort out its “mess”.\u0026nbsp“I am very clear we have to do nothing. We are ready and they have to come,” he advises. “And we have to wait while the air becomes thinner and thinner because we lose time.”On another occasion, officials are also bemused at Ms May’s invocation of “war spirit” in her conference speech.After one encounter in which Mr Verhofstadt has an argument with Brexiteer Tory MP Andrew Rosindell,\u0026nbsptop aide Ms\u0026nbspRettman-Crosse tells her boss: “I’m most proud of you when you take on a Tory.

You can’t just say ‘it’s all beyond my control’. If you are a member of the cabinet, you have a responsibility.”He also said Jeremy Corbyn’s incentive was not to “rescue” the prime minister in cross-party Brexit talks but to replace her in Downing Street, adding: “I don’t know how much longer the Conservative Party will give her but I would find it extremely odd if we got to the Conservative Party conference and there was still Theresa May giving the leader’s speech.“I think we are going to know within a couple of weeks whether there’s any prospect of a deal between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May and whether the Labour Party are going to rescue her premiership. Once it becomes clear that they are not going to rescue her premiership, I don’t really see the point of going on.“There aren’t Brexit negotiations. It is just that Theresa May and the government don’t want to break off the talks because that would be an admission that they have run out of options.”What does the EU think of Theresa May’s leadership?The former chancellor’s comments came after Sir Graham said outside a meeting of the 1922 committee on Wednesday he had held two meetings with the prime minister in recent days.\u0026nbspHe refused to confirm to journalists whether her departure from Downing Street will be discussed next week, but a second Tory MP declared: “A week has been bought.”\u0026nbspSir Graham also said it was the government’s intention to bring back the withdrawal agreement bill “sooner rather than later” and “before the European elections”.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families.

Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand.

The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.622 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard.

And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale.

But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2022 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2122 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”.

who was third in line to the throne in  - is now sixth in line.His newborn son Archie is seventh in line to the throne.Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, born on May th  will take the seventh place in the queue, bumping Prince Andrew, the Duke of York down to eighth place.This moves Princess Beatrice and Eugenie down to ninth and tenth respectively.But who was dropped from the top ten Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, lost his top ten seat.Harry and Meghans newborn was introduced to the world on May , , but a name is yet to be announced.The rules of royal succession have changed signicantly in recent years.Leaders of  British Commonwealth countriesvoted in  to alter the centuries-old tradition to include daughters as well as sons.Previously daughters could only inherit the thronethere were no living sons.This system, which dated back  years, is based on the rules of primogeniture which gives preference to the firstborn male heirs of a king or queen.This change in royal succession means Princess Charlotte, as William and Kates daughter, is ahead of her younger brother.Previouslythe third child was male he would leap the princess in the line of succession.This new rule only takes into account children born after , meaning Prince Edwards youngest child, James, born in , is ahead of his older sister, Louise, born in .Commonwealth leaders also decided in  to remove the rule that no heir could assume the thronehe or she married a Roman Catholic.Then Prime Minister David Cameron said at the time: “The idea that a younger son should become monarch instead of an elder daughter, simply because he is a man just isn’t acceptable anymore.Nor does it make any sense that a potential monarch can marry someone of any faith other than Catholic.“The thinking behind these rules is wrong.The Roman Catholic rule can be traced to the th-century reign of Henry VIII.The King broke with the Roman Catholic Church to orce his we, Queen Catherine, and marry Anne Boleyn.The changes, under the Succession to the Crown Act , came into force in March  but apply to people born after October , .Live Science reported that because one of the duties of the British monarch is to head the Church of England, no Roman Catholic can hold the crown.The basis for the succession was determined in the th century.When James II fled the country in , Parliament held that he had abdicated the government and that the throne was vacant.The throne was then offered, not to Jamess young son, but to his daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange, as joint rulers, following the Glorious Revolution.At -years-old, Prince Charles is the longest-serving heir in UK history - having been first in line from the age of three - and would become the oldest ever British monarch to take the throne.Some royalists have argued that Prince Charles should step aside to allow Prince William to become King because he enjoys better approval ratings with the public based on a  poll.Prince Charles has faced controversy over his orce from Princess Diana and his affair during their marriage with now-we Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.He has also been accused of “meddling” in politics by stating his opinion on issues like the environment and farming, alternative medicine and architecture in private letters to Government ministers.In , Edward VIII - the Queens uncle - famously abdicated after less than a year on the throne so he could marry orcee Wallis Simpson.Prince Harry says no royal wants to be King or Queen — but they would do it for “the greater good”.The -year-old said: “Is there any one of the Royal Family who wants to be king or queen I don’t think so, but we will carry out our duties at the right time.”He told Newsweek magazine: “We are involved in modernising the British monarchy.We are not doing this for ourselves but for the greater good of the people.”And he insisted the royals were still vital, adding: “We don’t want to dilute the magic.“The British public and the whole world need institutions like it.”The long-serving royal has stepped back from a public role after  years of royal duties.His final solo engagement was The Captain General’s Parade in August , when he saluted the Royal Marines at Buckingham Palace.Due to English common laws, he cannot become king.The we of a king is known as a Queen Consort, and takes the title of Queen – although she doesn’t rule as the monarch.Buta female royal marries a man with a title below her own - as in the case of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip - she will retain the title while her husband will not be entitled to it.He is known as Prince Consort.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody trusts Mrs May and for good reason. She has broken too many promises.She insisted we would leave the EU customs union which sets our trade policy and our tarfs with other countries.Now she is ready to tear up this pledge, leaving Britain in limbo with no say and no gain. We will also abandon hard-won trade-union reforms and accept the sort of red tape that has seen EU joblessness rates soar.The PM is being pressed to allow a second referendum — rejected, until now, as a total betrayal of the first one.Will she go wobbly on this promise, too The stark truth is that Mrs May should not even be in charge of talks.She is now working her notice with no authority as PM. She should have been kicked out after her catastrophic general election shambles.Jezza has also upset voters by putting his Downing Street ambitions and a hunger for a general election ahead of the national interest.Voters knew exactly what they were doing last week when they gave a V-sign to both parties. They will give them an even bigger kickingthe EU poll goes ahead later this month.Parliament has failed. MPs have defied the will of the people by refusing to enact the democratic choice made in  to leave the European Union.Voters will use Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party as a stick to beat them with.Farage is a much more challenging figure this time round.The slightly raffish former merchant banker has grown out of his “cheeky chappie” Ukip image. He is now electable. Fed-up punters, both Tory and Labour, will vote for him in their millions.Unless the Tories wake up very quickly, dump Mrs May and pick a genuine pro-Brexit leader, he will be fielding a party of his own MPs in Parliament after the next election.The Brexit Party will have its first MP in just a month’s timeJacob Rees-Mogg’s sister Annunziata wins the Peterborough by-election on June . Smug Remainers should now see how much they are out of step with the great British majority.The likes of Anna “Suck It Up” Soubry and co-conspirator Dominic Grieve will pay the price as their Change UK party sinks without trace, swamped by a pro-Brexit surge.Pro-EU Lib Dems are a phantom party, led by ghostly Vince Cable, a bolt-hole for voters who can stomach neither Labour nor Tory.Cynics claim this is the end of the two-party system.Labour, under its present leadership, certainly cannot win on its own.People are fed up with Brexit. They want it sorted. More than half the adult population want Out.This is natural Tory territory.

You can’t simply take something off somebody and refuse to pay them the proper price.Nobody will shed a tear for the handsomely paid CEOs in Corbyn’s line of fire.

And we need to find out what.”It wasn’t, however, until Gill Biggeloe was unmasked as the latest bad apple, that the episode really lost the plot.Firstly by trying to repeat series four’s “Urgent exit required” text trick.Then by turning sweet, little ginger Tina, who went for Biggeloe in the toilet with a kne, into a member of the OCG death cult. And finally by asking us to believe DI Cottan’s death twitches signalled four people were H.For some, I know, this will have been a step too far, but I’m still keeping the LoD faith.It may demand a lot of viewers and take risks, but that’s what all great dramas should do.And,some don’t come off, it’s one of the few home-made shows that can usually fall back on its script or the astonishing performances of its cast.Particular plaudits this series, of course, go to Adrian Dunbar who’s turned Superintendent Ted Hastings into a television legend and, in these crucyingly right-on times, reminded us how much the public still loves a strong male character.I don’t expect such an important message to register with BBC drama, where every overpaid moron in the building will be running around shouting: “We need a female Ted.” But that’s their funeral.Line Of Duty will still have over ten million viewers hooked, whenever it s, because, as we learned in the closing credits, its integrity, storyline and main characters all endure: Arnott’s been exonerated after shooting Tina.OCG member Ryan’s at police training college.

Twins, one boy, one girl.

Fair enough.Equally, no one was much bothered whether or not Meghan came out on the steps of a hospital  seconds after giving birth. Each to their own and all that.But being Hollywood-style “woke” means you can’t just quietly get on with it and let your actions speak for themselves.No, you have to make grand declarations about your right-on credentials, such as “climate change is a very important issue” or “racism is abhorrent” as , by not making such virtue-signalling statements, the rest of us disagree and need to be enlightened.And so, rather than just announcing the birth when it suited them, they issued a rather pompous and bewildering press release to tell us in advance that they wanted to “keep the plans around the arrival of their baby private”.Asthe Press and public were constantly banging on the door of their easily accessible, terraced house, demanding to knowlittle Wayne or Waynetta had arrived yet.This push-back, following as it did the very public ghosting of Meghan’s father Thomas, risked alienating those members of the public with a genuine fondness for the prince and his new we.But happily, all the nonsense was forgotten the moment Harry bounded in to the stables area at Windsor Castle, where a select few of the world’s media were assembled.As the horses behind him gazed disinterestedly into the middle distance, his obvious delight at becoming a father was written all over his face.This was the Labrador puppy-esque Harry of old, and thanks to his excellent “How women do that is beyond comprehension” remark, he’s now firmly reinstated as the uncomplicated, cheeky chappie we all have a soft spot for.So, a heartfelt congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on the birth of their first child.And moving forward, perhaps a little less of the stage-management and self-important virtue-signalling would be wise.In other words, take a leaf out of our admirable Queen’s book and just show us what you’re made of, rather than tell.PRINCESS CHARLOTTE celebrated her fourth birthday last week with a party at Kensington Palace.One can only imagine what a hot ticket that was at her primary school.Not among the children, silly. I mean the parents.The fevered anticipation at school pick-up time must have been palpable.Is there a gilt-edged stfyin the backpack or not Should they wait until they’re in the car before looking Or should they just fall to their knees in the playground right now for a spot of desperate, unseemly rummaging In the event, Prince William described it as “a rowdy party” which suggests that he and Kate swerved any potential breach of social etiquette by inviting the whole class. Phew.But of course, small children, the elderly or infirm would have had no chance in the face of such disastrous selfishness.QUEEN the band are now richer than our actual monarch following the worldwide success of their movie Bohemian Rhapsody.Guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor are the brains behind the biopic, which focuses on former frontman Freddie Mercury, who died in .But perhaps the smartest of them all is bassist John Deacon, who, despite being asked to be involved in the planning and production of the movie, didn’t even reply to the email – preferring to live a non-famous, quiet le in West London with his we and kids.While still benefiting from the enormous royalty cheques, of course.SO let’s get this straight.

And right across Europe it is the new populist parties which will hold the whip hand come May . Electors are furious about uncontrolled immigration, tired of the bureaucratic EU and sick to the back teeth of social liberalism.Like never before they are backing the populists, in countless countries across the continent. They already now run Italy, Austria, Poland, Hungary and Estonia, having come from almost nothing ten years ago. But in these Euro elections the change will be even more dramatic.Across Scandinavia, in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, more and more electors are deserting the centre parties for what the BBC, holding its nose between two fingers, likes to call the “far Right”.Largely nationalist parties which care about national sovereignty and do not care for immigration. Sometimes radical socialist parties which resent the bullying EU.The centrist liberals of the European People’s Party and the socialists are likely to be routed, a response to decades of mismanagement and arrogance. For the first time EVER they are unlikely to hold an overall majority.And the numbers of populists making headway will be swelled by our own generous contribution — because Nigel Farage is marching back to Brussels — and his Brexit Party will secure at least a few dozen seats on May . This is an enormous problem for the current, discredited, EU leadership.One Brussels panjan- drum said it would lead to “institutional paralysis” within the EU. My response to that is: How will we tell  But he is probably right.The new parties are opposed to everything the current administration stands for. They are Eurosceptics. They wish the EU to be a trading bloc, not a supranational government telling every country what to do.They are largely socially conservative. They have little truck with the identity politics of the liberals. And they hate uncontrolled immigration. This will lead to an enormous upheaval in Brussels.They’ve woken up and smelled the coffee. The liberals know that their cards have been marked. But what Europe faces is a year or two of wrangling as these new parties seek to exert influence over the EU.And it will be made worse by the fact that the European People’s Party is itself split over what to do about immigration. A good proportion of EPP members have woken up and smelled the coffee.It’s all a bit ironic, isn’t it  Three years ago we voted to leave the EU — for many of the reasons that have led to this surge for the populists on the European mainland.If the populists can gain control of some of the EU’s institutions, it might become a much more palatable organisation for British people.Ah well. But one thing is for sure. In the UK, in the US, in Brazil and in the EU, liberalism has had its day.

That was the conventional verdict.But the longer you look at them, the less loopy Lords Jug and Sutch start to look. Were they possibly not more sane than many of our “real” politicians It’s not asJug smashed mobile phones against the wall , shaved the back of his hands Peter Mandelson, or travelled by sledge to the Arctic Circle for a photoshoot with huskies vain nincompoop David Cameron.And Toby Jug certainly missed a trick by never granny-dancing on to a party conference stage to the strains of Abba. We had to wait for “dependable” dullard Theresa May to do that.Mrs May or Lord Toby Jug: Which was more deserving of being carted away by the men in white coats Which was closer to the public’s views  Don’t be a mug, vote Toby Jug. And that was a better slogan, was it not, than Mrs May’s daft, delusional  General Election claim that she was “strong and stable” She croaked it like a demented parrot. “Strong and stable” turned out to be as truthful as some fruitcake who marches along your high street claiming to be the King of Prussia.Our politicians love to pose as shrewd sentries outside the nation’s coffers. They boast about their cleverness and financial acumen and yet they propose blowing £billion — more likely £billion, say sceptics — on a swanky new railway line that may reduce journey times between London and Birmingham by just a few minutes. Few voters want the HS line yet MPs press on with it. Nuts.Mrs May, who is forever lecturing the poor about how our tight public finances bind her hands on necessary spending, gaily proposes giving the EU a £billion cheque for almost nothing in .Does the House of Commons pin her down and ask her what the blazes she is doing  Nope.Who is the bonkers one here  It wasn’t Jug who, hoping to look virtuous, told police to reduce stop and search, a decision which was followed by a dreadful rise in kne murders of black kids. That was another crazy policy of the turbulent, scowling, almost catatonic T May.If you meet MPs, as we politics reporters must, you will hear them say that our PM “has lost it” and “needs help”. These are not poor-taste jibes about mental health. They genuinely believe Mrs May is unwell. Yet they will not remove her from an office in which she has command of our Armed Forces. Who’s pottier here  Mrs May, or the MPs who indulge her Take a look at the  General Election manesto of the Monster Raving Loony Party. One of its policies was: “We will introduce votes at .” They clearly thought that was a comically absurd idea. Today it is national policy in Scotland and is supported for the rest of the country by the Labour Party.Another  Monster Raving Loony proposalwas: “Solving the problem of over-crowding in prisons by releasing all innocent prisoners.”Our political class has gone one better than this. It has sought to solve prison crowding by releasing GUILTY prisoners.Then there was the Loonies’ idea to give House of Lords seats to: “Anyone who writes a problem page in a national newspaper.” Daft, of course. Instead, Labour gave a peerage to minor TV personalityAlan Sugar.The last gem from the  Loonies’ manesto was a promise to hold: “A referendum on whether people want a referendum on Europe.”Good joke — except that it has come horribly true. We were told our  EU referendum was a “once-in-a-letime” chance to decide whether or not to stay in the EU.Many MPs now want to block that poll’s Leave result and say it was merely a rehearsal for another referendum.Nurse, we need more straitjackets here!RIP, Lord Toby Jug.

The report by England’s human rights watchdog lays bare a North-South ide over inequality - with a postcode lottery in education, health, employment and living standards. The report “Is England Fairer ” is from the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and was shared exclusively with the Mirror’s Data Unit. It shows that those living in the North East are particularly badly off, while those in the South East have the best le chances in the country - even out-performing London. The report finds that the unemployment rate in the North Eastis now nearly twice as high as it is in the South East . Nearly a third of workers in the North East are in low-paid workcompared to just a quarter of those in the South East .        And people in the South East earn £. more an hour on average than they do in the North East - with median hourly earnings of £. compared to £.. That means % of all children in the North East are currently living in poverty, compared to just % of children in the South East. Caroline Waters, deputy chair of the EHRC, said: “We are living in an increasingly ided society. “As the country grapples with Brexit , it’s more important than ever that we address the fractures in our society and ensure opportunities are shared fairly across the country. The report found a quarter of adults in the North Eastexperience severe material deprivation, compared to one in every six in the South East . Meanwhile, one in every three adults in the North East report poor health , compared to a fth of those in the South East .  People in the North West and the West Midlands are also often worse off than those living in the rest of the country. And while London beat the South East in some areas, such as earnings, the capital also has the highest proportion of people working in insecure jobs, and particularly high levels of poverty and poor health. The report compared  dferent data sets to put together a ranking of inequality. Ms Waters said: “Where you grow up should not determine your outcome in le.  “We’re seeing an increasing push to devolve power and build better infrastructure outside London. Local Mayors, councils, charities and businesses are uniquely placed to ensure that this is fair growth and doesn’t leave anyone behind. “Equality across England isn’t out of reach but dferent regions must work with and not against each other. “Organisations in all areas of England have something to share and by combining their experience and expertise, we have a much better chance of improving le outcomes for everyone, no matter where they live.” Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett said: This report lays bare the striking regional inequality that ides England, but which all-too-often gets left out of the national conversation. “For generations the North of England has been held back by Tory elites that have failed to invest, that have made decisions in the interest of the wealthy and powerful, and that have bodged regional devolution. A Government spokesperson said: “Creating opportunity across the UK will always be our priority, which is why we are investing £m over three years to deliver better educational outcomes and le chances in some of the most deprived areas. “We have also committed over £ billion through devolution and growth deals, helping further empower local people to make the key decisions that affect their lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"george osborne says tories reponsibility","story":"NewsGeorge Osborne says Tories have responsibility to oust lame duck Theresa MayThe former Chancellor urged the contenders lining up for the Tory succession to actShareCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical CorrespondentAndrew Woodcock:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe former Chancellor was sacked by Mrs May \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheresa May is a lame duck Prime Minister and is unlikely to survive in the position to the Conservative Party conference in September, George Osborne has said.

The highly symbolic move is a boost for the battle to rescue the leline, which the Tories have thrown into jeopardy. Conservative MPs did not oppose a motion calling on ministers to continue funding the benefit - meaning there was no vote. But the non-binding decision leaves the door open to pensioners being stripped of the perk. Labour ’s Deputy Leader Tom Watson said: “Today the House of Commons expressed its unanimous belief that the Government should stand by its manesto pledge to protect free TV licences for over-s.  “Members of Parliament and campaigners have made it clear that scrapping free TV licences is a betrayal of our older citizens, and this Government should listen.” National Pensioners Convention general secretary Jan Shortt said: “By passing the motion, MPs have shown the strength of feeling around the country at the unfairness of scrapping the TV licence for the over-s.” Tonight’s three-hour Commons showdown was aimed at piling pressure on Theresa May to honour a  election pledge to preserve pensioner benefits for the letime of this Parliament, due to run until . Ministers had already plunged free TV licences into uncertainty after stitching up a  deal which placed responsibility for funding the £million-a-year cost onto the BBC from June .  Launching a blistering attack on the Tories, Mr Watson blasted “austerity by the back door”, adding: “The public knows that and pensioners know that.” Pointing at the Tories, Shadow Culture Secretary Mr Watson said the debate was “about keeping a promise - a promise made by the party opposite on page  of their election manesto just two years ago”. Quoting the pledge to “maintain all other pensioner benefits, including free bus passes, eye tests, prescriptions and TV licences, for the duration of this Parliament”, he said there was “no equivocation, no ambiguity”. But he went on: “That promise lies in tatters - . million older people in receipt of free TV licences could be betrayed unless this Government acts. “Rather than standing by their manesto promise and standing up for dignity and comfort in old age, the Government are taking it away.” Currently all households with someone aged  or over are entitled to a free licence.  The BBC will announce within weeks its plans for the future of the benefit. Options include scrapping free licences altogether, replacing them with a % concession for all over-s, lting the threshold for eligibility to  or , or means-testing so those who get pension credits are able to claim the benefit. Opposition MPs, led by Labour backbenchers, lined up to slam the Government. Jim Cunningham claimed the Conservatives were guilty of “a deception on pensioners”. Accusing ministers of “passing the buck”, Tan Dhesi said: “Cutting free TV licences will merely exacerbate the national loneliness crisis.” Urging ministers to “end the preication - and do that today”, Paula Sherrf said the uncertainty over the future of free licences was “signicantly worrying” for over-s.  Anna Turley said the move was “unfair” on pensioners, while Jack Dromey said pioneers of pensioner benefits would be “turning in their graves”. Pat McFadden told MPs: “In policy terms, this is the equivalent of a hospital pass.” Liz Twist said: “This is not a matter for the BBC, it’s a promise made by the Government.” There was praise too for the Daily Mirror, which is campaigning to save free licences. More than , readers have supported our fight by completing coupons in the paper. Speaking in the Commons, Shadow Culture Minister Kevin Brennan said: “I want to remind the House that we have consistently opposed this underhand stealth tax on older people and the creative sector and strongly support the excellent campaign that has been run on this by many of my honourable friends, but also by publications like the Daily Mirror.”  While the BBC agreed to the  arrangement, it do so “only in the same way that the victim of a robbery agrees to hand over their wallet with a gun pressed against their head”, he insisted. MPs from other parties also threw their weight behind the fight to save the benefit.

The PM hopes the symbolism of the poll three years after the UK opted to leave the EU will force some MPs to finally back her plan. She bought her fragile leadership extra time by agreeing to meet top Tory backbenchers next week to discuss her future. It came as cross-party Brexit talks between Labour and the Tories to try to break the impasse appeared to be on the brink of collapse. The two sides met again on Wednesday but there appeared to be little movement towards a compromise and time was running out.    No  insiders suggested Mrs May was ready to move onto her Plan B of giving MPs votes on dferent options - but onlyLabour agreed. Downing Street sources also confirmed she wants to bring the Brexit withdrawal bill before Parliament as soon as possible. The plan to give MPs another vote before May  was revealed by Sir Graham Brady after a crunch meeting of the Tory  committee. He suggested it was likely to take place next week although MPs had previously been told not to expect any major votes then. “It’s my understanding it’s the Government’s intention to bring a second reading of the Bill forward in the near future, certainly the intention is before the European election takes place,” he told reporters. Sir Graham also revealed that Mrs May - who he pressed earlier this week for her departure timetable - had persuaded colleagues to allow her to kick the can down the road for another week despite disastrous local election results.    She volunteered to meet the  Tory MPs on the ’s executive committee next week to discuss her departure in person. Tory Brexiteers emerged grim-faced from the meeting. Nadine Dorries said: “She’s not given any decision, there’s no timetable and they need to get on with it. We need to make sure we get that final decision soon because everybody needs it.”    Jeremy Corbyn this morning launches Labour’s election campaign promising to “unite our country” and heal the isions caused by Brexit. He vows to address inequalities that helped fuel Brexit insisting the “real ide” isn’t over Europe but between the many and the few. After a bitter internal row over a second referendum, he will restate that Labour backs a fresh public votea “sensible” Brexit deal cannot be agreed. Labour hinted it was preparing for cross-party talks to break down later this week after failing to reach agreement on a customs union.  A spokesman said the party was expecting movement in the “next few days” and the negotiations were not an “indefinite” process.  Meanwhile, a major independent report on the economic impact of a customs union Brexit concluded it would leave people in the UK £ a year worse off and cut money available for public services by £bn. Mrs May yesterday faced down demands to leave her job whether or not she secures a Brexit deal.  The PM even claimed she could stage a Liverpool-style comeback, telling MPs: “What it shows is that when everyone says its all over, when your European opposition have got you beat, the clock’s ticking down, it’s time to concede defeat actually we can still secure success is everyone comes together.” It came as George Osborne, who was sacked as chancellor by Mrs May, said it was now time for the Cabinet to mobilise and oust her.   “Eventually the party has to confront the truth. It needs a new leader, a new agenda, it needs to win over supporters who have disappeared and make an appeal to urban, metropolitan Britain that has turned its back on the Conservatives,” he said. His intervention came as Tory cabinet ministers, Andrea Leadsom and Amber Rudd, hinted they would be prepared to run for the leadership. Ms Leadsom, who made the final two against Mrs May in , told GMTV: “I am seriously considering standing”.    Ms Rudd will Thursday urge the Tories to seize the chance to become the party of the st century worker.  In thinly veiled remarks, she will say: “We know that switching jobs is often the best way to open up new opportunities and progress in the workplace.” Tory chiefs signed off a cut-price campaign for the elections after finally admitting the poll would go ahead. “We are up and running, and our message is, there’s only one party that can deliver Brexit,” a spokesman said. But senior Tory MPs warned that the party was likely to receive a kicking from voters - with many turning to Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. Former minister MP Rob Halfon said his party was a “sh*tshow”, adding: “Our grassroots operation, already weakened, has been further damaged [by the local elections] and is now on le support”.

Caron recalls a simple -minute reflex test at Nuffield House was enough for a neurologist to confirm Alix didn’t have arthritis - and she was rushed to hospital for an urgent MRI scan.  Three hours after her scan, doctors at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital told the teenager they had found a tumour on her spinal cord.  She had to endure a five-hour operation for a surgeon to take a biopsy of the tissue around her spine.  Caron said: “Alix lost use of her hands and left leg but she had no pain. It was only her back that was sore so they thought she might have an inflammatory disease.”  “Her surgeon told us he had looked at her biopsy and there was in fact no tumour, it was just a growth.   “We were absolutely delighted but unsure what would happen because we knew something was wrong.” She stayed at the surgery aftercare unit for eight weeks when neurologists began to speculate that there might be a tumour after all.  Before her th birthday in March, Alix was allowed to go home in a wheelchair and was due tofor another MRI scan but both her arms and legs gave in.  She was admitted to AE after she fell at home and was unable to get up.  Caron said: “When we arrived the surgeon kept assuring us it wasn’t a tumour. We scheduled another biopsy but it was postponed after Alix got blood clots in her lungs.” On April  Alix had another biopsy and the surgeon confirmed she had a cancerous tumour on her spinal cord.  The next day the heartbroken teenager was told it was incurable.  Caron said: “Her surgeon told us that the biopsy found an aggressive tumour in her spinal cord. Before the biopsy took place they said the original growth hadn’t changed. “How they could not have noticed this over five MRI scans and two biopsies is unbelievable.    “He said they originally thought the tumour was at stage  but it’s now at stage .” “I’ve been told that I can either take Alix home for palliative care or we can move to the Beatson.” Despite the NHS introducing stem cell treatment in January, the family have not been offered it.  A Go Fund Me page has been created to raise £ in funds to pay for private stem cell treatment with a Scottish company.  Kind well-wishers have already raised £, for popular Alix.  Caron praised her daughter for her strength and determination. She said:”Alix is amazing. She has her moments when she cries and says I don’t want to die. She’s got her wee dog, her friends and her whole le ahead of her.    “She was supposed to be studying childcare. She’s so brave and she knows we are doing everything we can.” She added:”The NHS convinced us for  weeks that there wasn’t a tumour and now they’ve told us she’s got two months to live.  “All those months she could have been receiving proper treatment. I’ve lost my job to become Alix’s full time carer. I’ll do everything I can to save her.” A spokesperson for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: We understand this is a very dficult time for Alix and her family and fully realise how very upsetting this is for them. This is an incredibly complex case with a very dficult diagnostic process and we continue to do all we can to support Alix and to reassure her and her family of the appropriateness of the assessment, diagnosis and treatment in this case.To donate to the Go Fund Me page click here ."},{"url":null,"title":"lotto results wednesdays winning national","story":"NewsLotto results RECAP: Wednesdays winning National Lottery numbers for £.million jackpotTonights winning numbers for the National Lottery draw and Thunderball - live updates belowShareByNeil MurphyUpdated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news offline video watch-national-lottery-draw-wednesday-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news uk-news lotto-results-wednesdays-winning-national- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\"Tonightaposs National Lottery offered the chance to win a whopping £. million jackpot.

Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor was introduced to his great-grandmother the Queen, in the medieval castle where  monarchs have raised their families since the days of William the Conqueror. The scores of huge canvases hung in gilded frames on the walls chart their history, caught in oils by the greatest artists of their day. But yesterday a man with a camera and computer, rather than a paintbrush and easel, captured what seemed a simple domestic scene but was in fact as historically signicant as all the coronation portraits and state ceremonials. The Welcoming of Baby Sussex shows a monarchy transformed forever by a young couple and their newborn son.    Her Majesty was meeting her Anglo-American, mixed-race great-grandson, a descendant of slaves now seventh in line to her throne. The delight on the face of the world’s longest-reigning monarch proved it was one of the happiest moments of her reign. Everything about this snapshot of modern monarchy, released on the Sussex’s Instagram account, shows how the Royal Family has changed in the years since Prince Harry was introduced to the Queen by his own parents. And of course the tragic death of his mother Princess Diana played a big part in persuading Her Majesty to adapt to her people’s will.    Harry would surely have been thinking of his late mother yesterday, and wishing she was part of this seismic moment in his le. But the new bond he has created with his mother-in-law, Doria Ragland, was clear to see. Dad Prince Charles and brother William were where yesterday. William and we Kate were on a visit to North Wales, where they lived as newlyweds. This was a day for the spotlight to shine on Harry. He and Meghan had asked photographer Chris Allerton to capture the occasion. He was one of their private wedding photographers and took what pals say was their favourite shot, of them hugging and watching the fireworks at the end of their big day.  And this new image has the same, candid quality. Meghan holds the son they have unconventionally called Archie, meaning “bold”, and Harrison, “son of Harry”. To her right is mum, Doria, , the nose-stud-wearing yoga teacher she calls her best friend. Doria gazes down at her grandson, completely at ease in the Queen’s drawing room. But it is the delight on the -year-old Queen’s face that many will find so touching. She had just ed from a visit to the Windsor Horse Show, where she laughed and chatted with pals, no doubt telling them about her eighth great-grandchild.  She looks desperate for a cuddle from what Meghan and Harry call their “little bundle”. Behind her the Duke of Edinburgh, , is also beaming. Philip had bumped into the couple earlier on their way to the official photo call and had a sneak peak at little Archie. And standing back, taking in the scene, is proud dad Harry. He has admitted he once “wanted out” of the royal family, more comfortable as Captain Wales in the Army than Prince Harry in The Firm. But yesterday he looked fit to burst into tears of happiness as Granny gave the seal of approval to Archie.  And he must have been wondering how he was going to tear himself away from his we and child for his long-scheduled visit to the Netherlands today. It is a photo that speaks volumes – about duty and institution, the past and the future. But most of all it is a snapshot of a loving family united in joy at the birth of a baby. Yet that huge oil painting in the background - a  landscape by Venetian artist Francesco Zuccarelli - is a reminder of how Harry and Meghan are changing the royal picture.  Because they chose to release this historic picture on social media – their ground-breaking @SussexRoyal Instagram account. They harnessed the power of modern technology to send a digital image of their son around the globe in seconds. And their precious little treasure now has a unique place in the historic royal gallery.

There was a frenzy of bets on the babyaposs name ahead of Meghan giving birth, although very few expected Baby Sussex to be called Archie, with bookmakers predicting Arthur, Spencer or James to be the most likely male names. Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor was born lb oz at .am on Monday, almost a week overdue. The royal couple revealed Archieaposs name to the public yesterday.

The -year-old appeared in awe of the royal tot who lay peacefully in Meghanaposs arms wrapped in a white wool shawl. Yoga teacher Doria stands in one of the grand rooms at Windsor Castle alongside Prince Harry . Next to the Duke are his beaming grandparents, Prince Philip and the Queen as they meet baby Archie - their eighth great-grandchild - for the first time.  Now the history-making photo is being celebrated and hailed as symbolic of multicultural Britain. It marks the first time in royal history that a British monarch has been pictured alongside a royal baby ’s black grandmother. Journalist Stig Abell tweeted: I have a mixed race family, and this image is beautul, important and inspiring. So I shall park my cynicism for once. The snap also encapsulates two women of contrasting upbringings and le experiences coming together - The Queen, who was born into royalty and does not know a dferent le.    And Doria, who was born to an antiques dealer father and nurse mum, and had a humble upbringing. Archie, seventh in line to the throne, is also the first biracial half-American and half-British member of the Royal Family. His heritage has been described as monumental” by Tessy Ojo, chief executive of the Diana Award, the charity established in honor of Princess Diana. She told PEOPLE magazine: “Like Harry and Meghan’s wedding, it changes the landscape in terms of bringing visibility around race and inclusion.  Patrick Vernon OBE, a prominent campaigner during the UK’s Windrush scandal, also described the photo as reflecting the royal family’s embrace of “modernity”. He told HuffPost UK: “The presence of the mother is signicantly important as it reminds the public and the royal family there is black in the Union Jack. “Britain is a multicultural and secular society - and Meghan and Harry reflect a new modernity to the royal family. “When people write the history books in the future...historians cannot erase us from the history of Britain again. Like all black mothers, she’ll play an important role in nurturing and giving her grandson a sense of identity and empowerment.”  Meghanaposs mum will no doubt play a huge role in Archieaposs le and instill some of the important le lessons she gave the Duchess. The -year-old former actress has previously heaped praise on the way Doria, a former air hostess and makeup artist, brought her up to be a aposglobal citizen.apos Writing on her now defunct blog, The Tig, Meghan said: My mother raised me to be a global citizen, with eyes open to sometimes harsh realities.  I must have been about ten years old when we visited the slums of Jamaica. I had never seen poverty at that level and it registered in my glazed brown eyes. aposDon’t look scared, Flower,apos she said. aposBe aware, but don’t be afraidapos. Meghan continued: Both my parents came from little, so they made a choice to give a lot – buying turkeys for homeless shelters at Thanksgiving, delivering meals to patients in hospice care, donating any spare change in their pocket to those asking for it, and performing quiet acts of grace – be it a hug, a smile, or a pat on the back to show ones in need that they would be alright. This is what I grew up seeing, so that is what I grew up being: a young adult with a social consciousness to do what I could, and to, at the very least, speak up when I knew something was wrong.    Meghan and Harry have also been keen to mention Doria in each baby announcement - which some may see as a snub to Meghanaposs father Thomas Markle. The -year-old hasnapost been referred to at all and a friend admitted he found out Meghan had given birth through the media. In the initial birth announcement it said: The Duchess’s mother, Doria Ragland, who is overjoyed by the arrival of her first grandchild, is with Their Royal Highnesses at Frogmore Cottage .    Earlier today Meghan gushed about baby Archieaposs impending meeting with The Queen and Prince Philip and said: So itaposll be a nice moment to introduce the baby to more family, and my mumaposs with us as well. And this evening when the photograph of Doria with Meghan, Harry, Philip and The Queen was shared it made special mention to Doria: This afternoon Their Royal Highnesses introduced Her Majesty The Queen to her eighth great-grandchild at Windsor Castle.

Under the Wildle and Countryside Act it is currently an offence to destroy nests of wild birds while they are in use. But the use of netting to prevent birds nesting in hedgerows and trees allows developers to get around the law to avoid delays caused by the nesting season. Environmentalists, including naturalist and TV presenter Chris Packham, have condemned the practice and say it has exploded in scale this spring.  The rise in the use of netting this year has been partly fuelled – experts say – by a % increase in housebuilding over the last five years as developers respond to government pressure to build homes as quickly as possible. But the sight of covered trees and hedges, including an incident in Quainton where HS contractors netted hedgerows, has sparked protests across the country, with campaigners filming birds and mammals trapped within netting and reporting offences to the police. Following a petition signed by over , people, Labour MP for Hartlepool Mike Hill MP will now lead a Parliamentary debate on whether the practice should be made a criminal offence on Monday afternoon.  He said: “I absolutely agree that we should not be encroaching in any shape or form on green belt land.” Earlier this year,  trees were covered by Sladen Estates in Guildford, Surrey, which is aiming to build  homes on a derelict site. Netting has also appeared on hedgerows in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, where Taylor Wimpey intends to build a -home development and this week over derelict homes in Brampton, Cumbria.  Chris Calow from the RSPB said: “There would be no need for netting at all developers ensured that all tree and hedge removal was completed outside of nesting season. “But, this is only half the picture, we need to make sure we are replacing what is lost with new trees and hedges. We all want to live in a country where our natural world isn’t in crisis and we can just let nature sing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince george predicted meghan markles","story":"NewsPrince George predicted Meghan Markles babys name with bizarre comment to dog walkerPrince George baffled a dog walker with the remark back in January, but it might have been an important clue about Meghan Markle and Prince Harrys royal babyShareCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience Writer:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsPrince George \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis will probably be very excited to have a new baby cousin.Meghan Markle and Prince Harryaposs boy was born on Monday, but it doesnapost seem like theyaposve had a chance to meet little Archie yet.But it turns out that George might already have a rather unusual connection to his new cousin - and itaposs all because of his name.

The exciting news that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had chosen to call their son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor was met with delight from fans this afternoon. The website posted an official statement shortly after the couple shared the happy news on their Instagram page. However the website announcement contained a very big mistake. Instead of naming Meghan and Harry as the totaposs parents it said Archie was the first child of Kate and William. For all the information and updates on the royal baby click here.    The statement was quickly changed once the error had been spotted - but not before hundreds saw. It said: Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor was born at : on Monday  May. He is the first child of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and is seventh in line to the throne.  Archie weighed lb oz and The Duke of Sussex was present for the birth. It has since been corrected to The Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Meanwhile, Harry and Meghan have broken with royal convention by making a personal decision not to use a title for their baby boy.  He will simply be known as Master Archie Mountbatten-Windsor. As the first born son of a duke, Archie could have become Earl of Dumbarton - one of Harryaposs subsidiary titles - or have been Lord Archie Mountbatten-Windsor.

Hours earlier, on May , , an express sleeper crashed at mph on our most notorious railway bend. Six died and  were injured, including Colin’s parents. But, incredibly, their seven-month-old son escaped death by inches – with just one scratch on his forehead. Firemen pulled him from the mangled compartment and took him to hospital for a check-up. The following day the Daily Mirror introduced the world to “The Miracle Baby Found In The Train Wreck.”    Now  years old, Colin Garness says: “I count myself incredibly lucky to have survived.” Speaking after we tracked him down half a century later, he adds: “We’d been in a sleeper compartment, dad on the top bunk, mum and me below. During the night I woke crying, and mum moved me to the end of the bed. “She always saidshe hadn’t done that I could have been crushed to death – and she counts her blessings.” The accident, which would prove a landmark in railway safety, happened at around .am as the train from London King’s Cross to Aberdeen sped north through Northumberland.    It all went wrong on the infamous “Morpeth Curve” where the railway line turns back on itself at  degrees – the tightest bend in Britain. Five people were killed when a train derailed there in  and the stretch had a mph limit. On the morning of the  crash The Aberdonian Express entered the curve at more than twice the limit after the driver lost concentration. He braked too late and the  carriages careered off the track.  Two shot up the embankment, another was speared by a section of rail. The Mirror’s report the next day on the “Nightmare on a sleeper express” told how dazed ­passengers escaped. A hero doctor, himself hurt, tended to the injured and dying before collapsing. Eleven fire crews battled to free those who were trapped – including the Garness family. Colin Senior, then , a mechanic in the Fleet Air Arm, and we Jackie, , were ing home to Lossiemouth, Scotland, after taking their son to see Jackie’s parents in Nottingham. Colin Junior, , now lives in Dundee with we Anne and children Emily, , Elizabeth, , and Murray, .  Colin, who works as an operations supervisor on an offshore oil , explains: “I knew about what happened from a very early age, because my parents wanted to tell me how lucky I’d been. “They’d picked up the Aberdonian Express in Grantham, settled into the sleeper compartment and gone off to sleep at about pm. “Suddenly they were upside down and being thrown about. It must have been terrying. “Mum was trapped, but because she had moved me in the night I escaped. Dad broke his shoulder. I don’t know whether it was when he was trying to break the door to get them all out. “Eventually people came and cut a hole in the cabin door and my dad managed to hand me out to them. “I was carried off to a family who lived nearby, who very kindly looked after me until I was taken to hospital to be checked over. I was completely unharmed – just a bump on my head.”  As Colin was rushed to Newcastle upon Tyne, his mum Jackie was still trapped. “She had to be cut out by the fire service,” he says. “She’d injured her back and has suffered back pain as a result.” When Jackie was freed she was loaded into one of  ambulances on scene. Colin’s parents were taken to Ashington Hospital –  miles away from their baby son. Staff reassured them little Colin was doing fine and next morning the Daily Mirror’s front page showed him happily taking a bottle from a nurse. Later that day his dad was well enough to visit him, reporting to Jackie he was “looking chirpy”. It was another  hours before Jackie was reunited with her baby, after two nurses took him to her. And the Mirror was there to capture the moment with our reporter writing: “Jackie cried with relief when he was gently placed beside her on the pillow.” A full inquiry was carried out by Colonel JRH Robertson, Permanent Secretary to the EnvironmentDepartment. He found the driver, Leslie Byers, , solely responsible.He said he failed to brake as he was worrying about a letter from bosses asking him to explain why he was four minutes late on a earlier run. The Colonel wrote: “Driver Byers relaxed his customary concentration and allowed his mind to become distracted.” But he added: “I was much impressed by Driver Byers. “He struck me as a very good type of driver and a careful and conscientious man. He did not seek to excuse himself in any way.” He said the driver had attached too much importance to the routine notice and taken “the implied criticism too much to heart”. In  British Rail began putting floodlit warnings carrying the speed limit well before braking points. They were dubbed “Morpeth boards”.  But technical issues meant they weren’t put on the curve itself until  when a sleeper derailed at the same spot, injuring . Colin says of the report: “I was impressed by how fair it was and how honest the driver had been. Dad doesn’t hold any ill will. He says ‘the guy was under pressure to make up time’. And imagine living with the knowledge your mistake led to six lives lost.” He says of a scrapbook his parents kept about the tragedy: “I used to read it but in my teens I got a bit of ribbing for being ‘The Miracle Baby’. “I didn’t think much about it after that until I showed my we the book. “Then, last week, without having registered the th anniversary, I got it out of the loft for my kids.” Showing them the pictures was tinged with sadness. “Because there are probably still six families affected by the crash. I was just a very lucky baby.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uks answer tutankhamuns tomb found","story":"NewsUKs answer to Tutankhamuns tomb found at ,-year-old burial site next to AldiArchaeologists have uncovered  artefacts in the Anglo-Saxon tomb in Prittlewell, near Southend, EssexShareCommentsByMatthew Dresch:,  MAY NewsArchaeologists excavating the burial chamber in Prittlewell, Essex \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailArchaeologists have discovered a trove of precious artefacts in an Anglo-Saxon burial chamber - dubbed the UKaposs equivalent of Tutankhamunaposs tomb. The site, which lies between a pub and an Aldi supermarket, was discovered in , however the full scale of the finds has only now been revealed. It is believed the tomb in Essex contained the brother of King Saebert, who appears to have been a Christian, despite the Anglo-Saxonsapos pagan beliefs. Some  artefacts were found in the excavation, including gold foil crosses which were placed over the eyes of the dead man, thought to be the ancient prince Saexa. Sophie Jackson, the director of research at the Museum of London Archaeology , which helped study the tomb, told the Daily Mail : This is one of the most signicant archaeological finds ever seen in England.It is the British equivalent of Tutankhamunaposs tomb as everything in it is just as it was left , years ago. It was found on an unpromising site, which is just really a grass verge, but this is an aristocratic burial site and the artefacts provide a great insight into religious le at the time. She added that the tomb is the earliest dated Christian Anglo-Saxon princely burial in the country.  Archaeologists have estimated it would have taken  working days to build the chamber, which contained exotic artefacts from around the world. Ms Jackson said the site had been fully excavated because, once discovered, it was vulnerable to potential theft. Artefacts uncovered include a lyre , a ,-year-old painted wooden box, and a flagon believed to be from Syria. It is the first time a lyre has been recorded in complete form, and the box is the only surviving example of painted Anglo-Saxon woodwork in Britain. Other finds included the gilded silver neck of a wooden drinking vessel used for wine, and decorative glass beakers.    I think the thing thataposs so strange about it is that it was such an unpromising looking site, said Ms Jackson. Itaposs between a bit of railway and a bit of road, essentially a verge. Itaposs not where youaposd expect to find it. Carbon dating indicated that the male died between AD and AD, so could not have been King Saebert, who died in AD. Fragments of adult tooth enamel suggest he was over the age of six, and the size of the coffin and placement of items within suggest he was about ft in. Ms Jackson said it was possible it was the kingaposs brother, Seaxa, adding: That may also not be correct, but thataposs the best guess. Thereaposs a lot of debate about whether he was a fully-fledged hairy beast Saxon warrior, or younger. Had he died before he could really prove himself as he could have been buried with more kit   The presence of artefacts from other kingdoms suggest wealth, she said. Itaposs a really interesting time when Christianity is sort of creeping in and this is all possibly before Augustinian sent his mission to Britain to convert the country to Christianity so they would have been just on the transition between having pagan burials with all your gear but also having these crosses, she said. The chamber, which was about ftby ftand around ftdeep, contained some  artefacts. Some of them will be displayed at an exhibition at Central Museum in Southend which opens to the public on May  and research will also be published in two books. The project was funded by Southend-on-Sea Borough Council and Historic England.

But in the clip she put online, the octopus starts sucking on her face instead. Sheaposs seen screaming and crying as she despairingly tries to yank the animalaposs tentacles of her skin. In the -second clip, shared on popular short-video  Kuaishou, the woman can first be heard telling her fans look how hard itaposs sucking as she tried to remove a tentacle from her upper lip.    But the pain becomes worse and the woman wrangles with the creature. I canapost remove it, she is heard crying. When she finally does so, she notices the small bloody wound on her cheek. She cries: My face is disfigured. At the end of the clip, the host remembered her original goal as she shouted Iaposll eat it in the next video.    An octopus typically uses its tentacles to catch prey or defend itself from potential attacks. It uses its long and strong arms to wrap around the other animals and its suckers to tightly attach to its flesh.  A mature giant Pacic octopus has some  suckers on each arm, and each sucker contains thousands of chemical receptors.    But people online had little sympathy for the blogger, said to be from Lianyungang, China. She deserves it. She tried to eat the octopus and the octopus tried to eat her too, one person wrote. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, another posted.

at Tannadice permanent.Aberdeen are understood to be one of a number of clubs here and on the Continent who’ve been keeping tabs on the -year-old loan star.Safranko remains under contract at parent club Aalborg for next season but there has already been contact with them from the Tangerines indicating they would be interested in doing business should they be willing to let the Slovakian go.With Dons boss Derek McInnes facing a squad rebuild this summer, he could be putting in a similar call to the Danish Superliga outfit.That Safranko is attracting attention comes as no surprise.A fans’ favourite at United, he has scored  goals in his  appearances since joining up last August.He is also going into the promotion play-offs next week in good form, having scored three goals in his last five outings.His work at United this season has earned him a recall to the Slovakian national squad for recent Euro  qualiers against Hungary and Wales.That’s increased his profile on the Continent and there is every chance of clubs there joining any chase for him.There is, though, also the possibility Aalborg could decide to have him in their squad for next term, leaving all interested parties including United disappointed.They’ve had a mediocre season and have only been averaging just over a goal a game in league matches.Tonight, meanwhile, Tangerines boss Robbie Neilson will be heading for Ayr to watch the first leg of the play-off quarter-final between the Honest Men and Inverness Caley Thistle.The pair meet again in the Highlands on Saturday and only then will United know where they’ll be heading for the first leg of their play-off semi-final a week tonight.Theleg of that one will be at Tannadice on Friday night and, should United get through, they will host the second-bottom finishers in the Premiership the following Thursday.With that potentially hectic schedule of four games in under a fortnight, the manager has given the squad a couple of days off before

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"christmas arrives at loch fyne sea angling club","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAfter a series of weather related cancellations, Loch Fyne Sea Angling Club finally held its Christmas and combined league outing on Saturday February .While conditions were challenging on Loch Etive, it proved to be a fun day.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

The weather was a challenge in itself due to the bitter cold, but the young people rose to the challenge and coped admirably.The climax of the weekend was the presentation of six Gold Chief Scout Awards to group members who have been working hard for four years to gain the highest achievement possible for a Scout. All six Scouts who gained the award have now started their careers in the Explorer section of the group.In late March members of the Scout and Explorer section joined with the Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation to undertake an Earth Hour Camp.

It was decided by those in high office that the gold-plated cockerel weather vane should be re-plated and that the Selkirk Town Clock should actually be removed for repair and cleaning. That clock and its illuminated front face were well maintained over many years by local jewellers and clock repairers and in more recent times has been well maintained by Ritchies in Edinburgh without recourse to actual removal from the building.This time the entire mechanismwas lowered by jib-crane and taken on a lorry down to England for a complete overhaul. That was fine and no-one noticed as the whole building was enveloped in scaffolding and plastic sheeting.However, when it didand was re-installed in its original place all was not what it seemed.In fact it has never kept time since it was put back in the Town Hall. Sometimes it simply doesnrsquot keep time, sometimes it doesnrsquot go at all and, even worse, it goes backwards!What happened to the role of Clerk of Works in all this turmoil and who signed off the work which was then proved to be faulty in the extreme with the steeple now leaking water where it had never leaked before and with huge double front doors that after ldquorestoration couldnrsquot be opened Is Selkirk actually taking a step back in time Are our Councillors backward Who knows, but come the Common Riding morning letrsquos hope Selkirk Silver Band big drummer John Nicol has a watch that keeps good time or neither the First Drum nor the Second Drum will ever take place!But in the middle of all this confusion I have recovered another great mystery, or is it mysteries What happened to the works of Selkirkrsquos mason-astronomer James Scott who was born in Midlem in  and died in November . Who was he and how did he acquire the title mason-astronomer  We have to rely on an interesting little booklet written by Bowmont Weddell, M.A., F.E.I.S and who was headmaster of Selkirk Public School in the s when he wrote and published the pare which was printed by Walter Thomson in High Street.James Scott was born at ldquoThe Burn in Midlem and followed his father and grand-father into the building trade as a stone-mason after school at Midlem.His hobby was the repairer of clocks and from that he became a builder of time-pieces and studied not just the time of day but also the universe and how it worked and related to time and movement.James was totally self-taught but among the books and manuscripts he read was a lecture paper by the City Astronomer of Edinburgh, William Peck. The stone-mason cum clock repairer got even more interested in the stars and planets and their movements to each other and became so knowledgeable that he could predict the phases of the moon and work out on a nightly basis where its place in the heavens would be.That saw him on a journey in which he designed and built, first of all, his ldquoGreat Clock which told the time accurately while at the same time represent the solar system and the relative movements of the stars and planets around the centre-piece, the sun. Included in this masterpiece are the signs of the Zodiac and through its  spaces this Great Clock tells the time, the placings of the planets and a pointer also displays the date and the year.He developed several clocks, long before the advent of digitisation and modern technology. Some of his works were famous and his Astronomical Clock formed a centre-piece of The Scottish Natural Exhibition in Edinburgh in .The ldquoGreat Clock and his elaborate but extremely accurate ldquoJupiter Clock which spelled out the movement of Jupiter and the rest of the planets in relation to the Sun and Earth, were kept locally and by the date that the Rector of Knowepark Public School, Mr Weddell, wrote his paper in  these valuable inventions were part of the fabric of Selkirk Town Hall, in custody of the people of Selkirk as a tribute and a memorial to a one-time stone mason and self-taught astronomer and clock maker, James Scott.The question is ldquowhere are they now They are obviously parts of Selkirkrsquos heritage and Selkirkrsquos past but also a glowing tribute to what can and should be done even today by people with the right attitude to their own environment.If a tin shed half way down The Green, built as a garage, can in any way be classed as Common Good Property and of any value to the burgh, then all efforts should be involved in finding out where these inventions of James Scott, the Selkirk Mason-Architect are now.These clocks are certainly worthy of the title Common Good property."},{"url":null,"title":"expect-cues-as-sporting-greats-set-for-book-festival","story":"SNOOKER legend Stephen Hendry canrsquot wait for this yearrsquos Borders Book Festival.The seven-time world champion leads a pack of sporting heroes appearing at the Melrose event next month.And he will be bringing the action from many World Championships to le as he discusses his book, Me and the Table.Hendry told us: ldquoI am really looking forward to come down to the Borders.ldquoIrsquove visited two or three times over the years to play snooker, but it has been so long since I was last there.ldquoThe book festival should be a really fun event.

Therersquos natural field run off, from the field to the south.ldquoMost of that seems to occur to the west of the site, but wersquore going to prevent any more run off by installing a cut off drain all the way around the site which will collect the water.ldquoThis drain will be connected to a culvert which runs under the railway to the north, and eventually runs into the Eye.ldquoThe other issue is that surface water is getting into the combined sewer that serves this area, and is causing problems down stream.ldquoSome road gullies are connected into this combined sewer and are causing surcharge of the sewer and in some cases flooding.ldquoWersquove out careful design into this, and wersquore not taking surface water to the combined sewer, wersquore taking it to the culvert under the railway.ldquoIt will be taken off at a very attenuated rate, at just two litres a second, which is a very small amount of water.

site, which includes a large area of communal land, known as the Greenhills, which is used by local communities and the former coal plant site and historic Waggonway land, were carried out over two years ago.The local authority produced a masterplan for the site based on the consultations, which it described as a ldquovision document for its future.However, neighbouring communities straddling

engineering study into its feasibility.In neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton, community councillors are keen to see the masterplan, which does not support a cruise port, adopted by the local authority.It sets out a range of ideas for the site, including the potential for a marina at the waterfront, business and economic sectors, and recreational land.Despite the investment into producing the masterplan and consulting the public, the only definite project confirmed for the site so far is an unmanned substation, which will bring offshore energy onto land for Inch Cape Offshore Ltd .ICOL, which are owned by Chinese State-owned company Red Rock, was granted permission for the substation after the Scottish Ministers called in its planning application shortly after East Lothian Council bought the land.The council confirmed earlier this month that is had agreed to sell part of the land to ICOL.A bid by local group the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust to buy part of the land for its own heritable project has been rejected by the council.The council told the trust it had been advised against selling until ldquosuch time as the future of the whole site has been

Itrsquos a tiny hill, and many people walk past without noticing it, as nature has covered much of it under a blanket of overgrowth.But close up Irsquove always thought it appears mysterious. It is made up of agglomerate, which is the remains of volcanic ash all mixed up with bits of other rock and stone, then solidied and compressed over millions of years.But in places the agglomerate rock looks like it could be the ancient rubble built walls of an old ruined castle. Steps now lead to the summit, and despite the smallness of the hill, the view from the top is quite spectacular.I could see Fidra Island basking in a shimmering sea when I climbed it in the evening of Easter Monday. I reflected that Robert Louis Stevenson must have once stood on this exact spot as he viewed what many say was his inspiration for Treasure Island.But my purpose that beautul evening was to find lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo. There was a local tradition that a small cave-like cavity on the north side of Yellow Craig bore this name, and although the origin of the tradition is lost, it was clearly linked to William Wallace.I found reference to this tradition in an old account from over  years ago in the Haddingtonshire Advertiser by a Mr Jamieson. However, it was brought to my mind when I read of the refurbishment of the Wallace Monument. As part of this, there will be the Luumlbeck letter on display, written by Wallace and sent to the merchants of Luumlbeck in .Wallace, it seems, was in East Lothian at the time this letter was composed. And it was this connection that sparked my memory of the reference to lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo on Yellow Craig and set me on my quest.But it was in the dying embers of the day we arrived, and I had limited time to explore. The kids had fallen asleep in the car and I think my long-suffering we was content to relax while I scrambled around a rock at the tail end of a fun but exhausting day.As I headed through the wood alone to the craig, the sun was already beginning to lower its head. The sound of birdsong was a crescendo naturersquos melody for spring.Yellow Craig wood isnrsquot ancient, most trees are around  years old. But there are some, mostly sycamores, which are clearly much older. They have exotic shapes and their twisted limbs and scaled bark make them look like fossilised dragons. Perhaps they are. There is one which grows close to the play park that even looks like a serpent.These older trees give this wood an ancient feel. There are also Scots pines, mostly along the edge of the wood. They are descendants of the great Caledonian Forest which once covered most of the north of Scotland. Patches of emigrant Scots pine can be found all over East Lothian and at Yellow Craig they seem to guard the wood from northerly gales, and they are bent and shaped by the wind.Scots pines also stand guard at Yellow Craig itself. When I arrived I didnrsquot initially head up the steps but scrambled up the northern slope, looking for Wallacersquos Mutton Hole.The meaning of this term is a subject of debate, and I claim no academic authority, but I wonderit could come from the term lsquomootrsquo, which is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning debate or discussion. A moot hall was a room for this purpose in a medieval building, but Wallace was a guerilla fighter, so could this meeting place have been his moot ha If this was so, perhaps Yellow Craig was a meeting place, where Wallace and his followers once met to discuss strategy. Could the idea of the letter to Luumlbeck have been decided here, as they cast their eyes across the sea from the vantage of the rock Itrsquos an interesting idea, but of course therersquos no historical evidence for it. Yet most of what actually happened in those times has no historical evidence.I couldnrsquot find the hole or hollow, as nature has claimed the slope and thick vegetation meant I was kept away from the recesses hidden behind. Perhaps winter would have been a better time to search.But I was not disappointed. I sat on the summit and my instinct told me there was a mystery here that remains untold. A scant and seemingly forgotten oral tradition is not much to go on. But often an ancient half-whispered tradition has grown from a seed of truth.There is a similar East Lothian connection to Wallace in the Garleton Hills. I have written of the Wallace Cave there and the traditions associated with it. There is enough connection to our national hero in East Lothian to say our landscape can also claim connection to him.I will search deeper for references to Wallacersquos Mutton Hole at Yellow Craig andmy findings to this pagemy search proves fruitful. But regardless of the results of this search, for me Yellow Craig will always be a place of magic contemplation and imaginative possibilities."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds-oldest-golf-scorecard-from-musselburgh-up-for-auction","story":"Estimated at pound,-,, the card, which has been framed and mounted, dates from December , .It shows that a Mr Cundell played the five holes within the Musselburgh race track twice, a total of  holes in  strokes.

Finally, after what always seems a long wait, the land is alive and the evenings are long.The colours of this time are a big part of the joy. The blossom and explosion of wild flowers really lts my mood and spirit.A big part of this, for me, is the dandelion. Itrsquos a wild flower which decorates almost everywhere at the moment, creating a carpet of yellow which then transforms into white puffballs of flying lsquowishesrsquo.So many people just see this flower as an annoying weed to be mowed away as soon as it rears its head, but I love the way it keeps cheekily popping up in defiance of our attempts to keep nature at bay. Itrsquos one of our native wild flowers and causes no damage like some real invasive plants can, such as rhododendron.And they benefit our wildle so much. Bees and butterflies feed on them and some birds eat the seeds. But the benefits of the dandelion to humans has also long been recognised.A tea-like drink can be made from the roots and leaves or florets. There are dferent recipes, as the whole plant is edible. You can even make dandelion wine.The sap also contains healing properties which help with a range of ailments, especially skin complaints and issues related to digestion. In fact, herbalists will tell you of a range of health benefits attributed to the dandelion, which is packed with antitoxins and vitamins.And, of course, there are many folklore traditions associated with the flower.One I was reminded of this week when introducing the flower to a class of school children was the belief that you will wet the bedyou touch the petals! There is a small truth in this, as eating the leaves may have a diuretic effect.Making a wish and then blowing the parachute-like wisps which carry the seeds is the stuff of my childhood.Make the wish in secret and the wisps will carry it and help make it true. It is said they can also carry thoughts and love to someone you are missing or thinking about.Other uses include finding out how much you are loved, how many children you may have, or how many years you have left!The dandelion can even forecast the weather, as the puffball will close in on itselfit turns dreich. Another name for it is the lsquoshepherdrsquos clockrsquo, because its flower opens soon after sunrise and closes before the sun sets.And so this week I brought some dandelions into classrooms in a school where I am storytelling.Before I introduced the flowers, I gave them a riddle: ldquoA lion that has no roar, with teeth that do not bite, children who fly away, once yellow has turned to white. They eventually got the answer.The name dandelion, it is believed, comes from the French term lsquodent de lionrsquo meaning lionrsquos tooth, a reference to the teeth-shaped leaves.Then we blew the lsquowishesrsquo in the classroom. I was quite taken with the sense of wonder the children displayed . Many of them caught and kept the lsquowishesrsquo for later. It was so simple, yet so magic.ldquoHave you got more  I was asked.ldquoTherersquos plenty outside you can pick at home time, I told them.But as I left the school, I noticed the road verge I had picked the flowers had just been mowed. All the dandelions were gone, along with the other wild flowers, and it looked lsquonice and neatrsquo.Maybewe paused for a moment to wonder at how amazing this simple and common flower is, and the benefits it gives, we would have a dferent attitude towards it.Eating hand-picked and hand-washed dandelion leaves is one way my children will eat greens. If I mix them into a stir fry, they will be eaten too. These flowers are not just an irritating weed, they are one of naturersquos gts.As I left the school at the end of the day, a child came up to me.ldquoLook, I have a wish I caught, he said, as he carefully unfurled his hand. ldquoIrsquom going to use it to send my love to my granddad."},{"url":null,"title":"work-set-to-start-to-restore-dunbar-east-beach-to-its-former-glory","story":"The once-picturesque sandy beach has lost huge amounts of sand to the tides in recent years.Now, planning permission has been given for a scheme which aims to reinvigorate the beach, which used to be a magnet for tourists.Groynes, a breakwater and rock armour are included in the proposal, which was highlighted by ward councillor Norman Hampshire at a meeting of Dunbar Community Council.Mr Hampshire, the local authorityrsquos spokesman for environment, told the Courier: ldquoWe have been working on this project for some time, trying to get a method where we can attract sand back onto the beach again.ldquoThe consultants who have been looking at it have taken some time to come up with this option: a redesign of the groyne and two breakwaters to prevent [the damage caused] when we have a large sea coming in it damages the main wall and drags sand off the beach.

And unfortunately, dear reader, there is much to worry about these days on that score.Read more: SNP declares war on cybernatsNowhere do we see it more than on social media. With this in mind, I applaud unequivocal attempts by prominent SNP figures, as outlined in yesterdayrsquos Herald, to denounce the online abuse spat out by some on their side of the constitutional debate, not just at opponents of independence, but anyone who dares say or tweet something, no matter how innocuous, that doesnrsquot chime entirely with their world view. Describing such keyboard warriors as ldquoweird, ldquocreepy, ldquopoisonous, ldquovicious ldquocowards, former party deputy Angus Robertson, MP Stewart McDonald and MEP Alyn Smith are absolutely right to point out that such trolling, bullying and harassment ndash much of it aimed specically at women ndash is not only out of order, but ultimately damaging to the cause they support.If anyone is in any doubt about the form this sort of intimidation takes, you need only look at last weekrsquos bullying of BBC Scotland journalist Emma Clford Bell. Researching a piece about Dundeersquos reaction to Nicolarsquos Sturgeonrsquos announcement on a possible second independence referendum, she did her job and appealed on social media for a pro-Union voice to appear among a ldquoiety of opinions ndash including pro-independence supporters ndash to be featured in the package. What followed was a pile-on of epic and bizarre proportions, as hundreds jumped on the bandwagon and accused her of bias, told her to ldquof*** off , that she was ldquoscum, a ldquoclown of a lassie and a ldquostupid bint.Primarily, this is a very personal ndash not to mention sexist ndash attack on Ms Clford Bell. But it also represents a worrying and increasingly common assault on the act and process of journalism itself, a wilful misunderstanding of what journalists do, a knowing conflation of news and comment, a perpetuation of the warped idea that ldquogood journalism is what I agree with, and ldquobad journalism is everything .Read more: SNP declares war on cybernatsMore than anything, it reflects a worrying lack of critical thinking. Indeed, some of the responses to those who criticised the bad behaviour are as grim as the initial attack blaming the victim, whatabouteryand reeling off old complaints about BBC presenters only makes it worse. Whorsquod want to share a movement, let alone a country ndash independent or not ndash with these people Ms Clford Bellrsquos experience is a depressing sign of the times that reflects a more general willingness to trade critical thinking for the ease of conspiracy theories, righteous anger, having a , and a sense of identity and community, eventhe latter is based on nothing more than the precarious idea of a shared enemy.At the same time, the power and reach of social media also attracts those looking to monetise certain views, not to mention nefarious organisations and even foreign states whose main aim is to stir up trouble. And since the current system encourages anonymity and duplicity, it can be hard to work out who or what is even real.The so-called lsquoCybernatsrsquo exist in a relatively tiny corner of social media, of course, their vitriol matched by those shouting about other extreme world views, most notably ldquoBrit Nats, Hard Brexiteers, Trump supporters and white supremacists.Theyrsquore all equally unsavoury, flourishing by using OTT, hysterical narratives to pinpoint and frame their attacks, often choosing to personally abuse the target in the process humiliate, intimidate and crush.Since they shout so loud, the lsquoCybernatsrsquo often succeed in getting the attention they crave, which in turn exaggerates how representative their views are within the Yes movement, thus turning off more moderate supporters and potential new recruits to the cause.Depressingly, thatrsquos why I think it will be so dficult for Messrs Robertson, McDonald and Smith to change anything. The attack dogs do so knowingly, in order to deliberately provoke attention, or are so far down the unthinking zealot road as to be beyond reach. What both have in common is that the more they insult, the easier it becomes.Such abuse has nothingto do with independence per se, but the damage for the wider Yes movement will be harder to disassociate.The appeal for nuance and persuasion comes at a time when both seem out of fashion, while extreme language pulses and trends through our discourse.Those of us looking for comfort should perhaps turn back to Dickens.

Mr Blair shts in his seat and remembers how there was a great deal of anxiety about how he wanted a referendum on the subject.He says: ldquoI had studied the history of devolution ndash which people had been striving a hundred years for and had not delivered ndash and had come to the conclusion that the biggest threat to devolution would have been in the House of Lords, where at that time ndash remember, this was before our reforms ndash there were the hereditaries, who were all sitting there so the Tories had an in-built majority.ldquoThe Tories were essentially against devolution and I knew the only way of heading off that House of Lords rebellion at the pass wasyou could say to them: lsquoIrsquom sorry, this is the settled will of the peoplersquo.ldquoI remember at the time all this bizarre stuff, with people saying yoursquore betraying the Scottish people by having a referendum, and I would saypeople are not prepared to vote for it, I donrsquot see how I am betraying them, but this was part of politics.

One of the things thatrsquos so depressing about the state of British politics at the moment is that people donrsquot see this big picture about the way the world is changing and realise therefore that at every single level your alliances become important.ldquoScotlandrsquos alliance with England is important. Britainrsquos alliance with Europe is important. Europersquos alliance with America is important. Because you are faced for the first time in modern times power is shting east [to] China and India. This is a vast geopolitical change.ldquoWe are more interconnected than ever before and therefore any alliance you have increases your own power.Mr Blair makes very clear he does not believe in allowing the First Minister a second bite at the independence apple.He says: ldquoFirst of all, I donrsquot think we should have one unless there really is a big groundswell of opinion for it and I donrsquot see that.ldquoSecondly, to be brutally frank about it, the last thing we need at this moment is another huge dose of constitutional uncertainty we really would start to damage ourselves fundamentally as a country.But I point out that, in the interconnected world he refers to, surely the Scottish Nationalists have a point thatthe UK leaves the EU, it would make sense for Scotland to leave the UK to rejoin the EU He does not accept the argument.ldquoI would still want Scotland to remain with the UK be in no doubt about that, says Mr Blair.ldquoBut itrsquos a statement of common sense thatScotland is in favour of Britain remaining in Europe and Britain leaves Europe, yoursquove obviously got another argument.ldquoI know when I say this some people in Scotland on my own side say: lsquoOh God, you canrsquot say that,rsquo but itrsquos a statement of the obvious. If yoursquore a Nationalist, it gives you an additional argument which is another very good reason by the way for not doing Brexit.I suggest he is taking a contradictory position by suggesting the last thing Britain needs is another Scottish referendum, but he is in the same breath proposing another one on Brexit.Mr Blair holds up his hands and says: ldquoI wasnrsquot in favour of having the referendum in the first place I wouldnrsquot have had the referendum on Europe.

She has lost the confidence of her own MPs, and has been served notice by the chairman of the Tory backbench  Committee.Senior Tories, like the former leader Iain Duncan Smith, are calling almost daily for the Prime Ministerrsquos departure. Collective Cabinet responsibility has broken down as ministers leak and brief and pursue their own irreconcilable agendas. Even her chief of staff, Gavin Barwel, has had to leave his social media  because of abuse from Tory colleagues.It doesnrsquot get much worse than this. No prime minister in modern history has clung to power so tenaciously. We are told that she doesnrsquot think any one could do the job any better. That she has a right to remain in office because she has conducted the negotiations thus far and has a right to see them through.But this is a ludicrous, self-serving argument. No football club would allow a manager to remain in charge after such a succession of disastrous defeats, with the players fighting amongst themselves and the fans leaving the stadium. Itrsquos extremely hard to imagine anyone doing the job any worse.Mrs May is not so much a caretaker prime minister, as Labourrsquos John McDonnell described her at the weekend, but a squatter in No Ten. Had it not been for the Fixed Term Parliament Act, she would have gone long since. Parliament is deadlocked while her dead hand is on the controls. The latest futile discussions with Labour over Brexit confirm that there can be no movement unless and until she goes.Labour would be foolish to agree any kind of deal with Theresa May. Almost any likely successor be it Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab or Boris Johnson, will disown any deal that this discredited Prime Minister has cobbled together. They wonrsquot be held to any agreement, and nor of course can parliament.Eventhere were to be a deal on a permanent customs union, as Labour has been demanding, there is zero chance of it being accepted by the DUP or Tory MPs. Theyrsquoll reject anything that looks like BINO ndash Brexit In Name Only. A signicant number of Labour MPs would agree with them.Then there is the referendum. We have been told, somewhat improbably, that the Prime Minister has been ldquoscenario planning a three-option referendum involving her deal, remain and no deal. But she is never going to call a Peoplersquos Vote. If Mrs May went back on her promises not to hold a repeat ballot, there would be such a catastrophic split in the Conservative Party that it would be destroyed as a political force for a generation.So why is Jeremy Corbyn pretending to negotiate a Brexit deal with a Prime Minister who could never deliver  Well, Labour was exposed to the immense frustration of the British voters during the local election campaign. Remainers and Leavers alike are appalled by the deadlock over Brexit and want to move on.Read more: Lidington confirms UK will stage Euro electionsLabour doesnrsquot want to have its fingerprints on any form of Brexit deal, but nor does it want to be accused of failing to honour the result of the  referendum. Two years ago, Labour voted overwhelmingly to trigger Article  which made the UKrsquos departure from the EU legally binding. Labour needs to appear willing to negotiate, but wants the blame to lie firmly with the Prime Minister when talks fail.Coming to an agreement with Mrs May, even a good one, would make Mr Corbyn an accessory to Brexit. And itrsquos not at all clear that the Labour leadership actually wants another referendum. It has anyway been relegated to the status of a backstop against a ldquobad Tory Brexit. Shadow Cabinet figures like Diane Abbott believe a repeat referendum would probably result in another Leave vote. But Mr Corbyn is acutely aware that his legions of youthful fans in Momentum support a Peoplersquos Vote. So he tries to look both ways at once.This may be enough to get Labour through the European elections. Many Conservative constituency associations, and MPs like Boris Johnson, are refusing to campaign for these elections on the grounds that they should never have taken place. It looks like delivering a Tory wipe-out. Labour is not going to do particularly well either, but , by pursuing a policy of studied ambiguity, it can hold onto some Leave and some Remain voters, that will do nicely.But it wonrsquot be so nice for the rest of us. Mrs May has to go, even , as happened with Chamberlain, the successor is a isive character like Winston Churchill. Mr Johnson is the party favourite to take over, and while many of us might find that an unattractive option, it would at least force the issue to some kind of resolution.

It lacks \"big thinking\", she says, and has lost the untidy energy that characterised its early days.But its not just Holyrood that has lost its ambition ndash its the institutions and bodies around it.A third sector that was previously bursting with ideas and determination now fears to speak out in case its funding is stripped away by vengeful ministers.ldquoI personally think the third sector, in particular, has been very conditioned in a way that they werenrsquot then,\" Ms Lamont says.ldquoI think therersquos a lot of people, who are all really good people ndash their ambition is less.ldquoBecause they donrsquot want to fall out, so actually they ask for what they think theyrsquoll get.ldquoI think whats happening now [is] worthy of an investigation by somebody, somewhere,people are willing to speak about it.ldquoThird sector organisations are reminded where their funding comes from, and so they donrsquot really push as hard as they might have done in the past.ldquoAnd actually also, people have accepted that Government backbenchers are not going to rebel.

But with the dominance of the SNP, \"you have to accommodate yourself with that realityyou rely on the funding and things like that\".The quality of political debate has also been hit. Most debates now, Ms Lamont says, are simply a proxy for something  - namely, the ongoing constitutional battle over independence.Meanwhile, there is an \"unhealthy\" dynamic that sees ministers rarely fielding questions from their own side, while the co-operative spirit Holyrood was meant to foster hasnt quite survived contact with reality.ldquoI always thought there was a slight naivety about this idea thatyou put people in a circle and say itrsquos a more [representative] parliament, theyre somehow more likely to agree with each other,\" Ms Lamont says.\"I donrsquot think so. I think itrsquos actually in some ways more tribal. But itrsquos not tribal around policy mdash itrsquos tribal around what itrsquos a proxy for.She says the balance between the executive and parliament has changed over the years, with almost half of the current SNP group holding ministerial posts.The former Scottish Labour leader advocates a more \"mature\", cross-party approach. This could see Green MSPs, who helped vote through the minority SNP Governments Budget earlier this year, drafted in as ministers.ldquoIf they stuck somebody like Andy Wightman in to do land reform, into their Cabinet, that would be quite a good trade-off against other things that the Greens might not be able to do,\" she says.But amid the disappointments, there have been plenty of good times.Ms Lamont looks back fondly on those early days, when anything seemed possible and friendships were forged \"in that sense of being under siege\".ldquoI mean, it was really good fun,\" she says. \"It was hilarious.

Because itrsquos survey on survey, estimate on estime, the accuracy issue is very dficult to overcome.ldquoWe have not found a way of addressing that issue of risk.ldquoThe level of risk is such that we are not in a position to sign this off.Under EU law, VAT must remain consistent throughout a member state, meaning the power to set VAT cannot be devolved at present.However Mr Mackay said thatBrexit went ahead, the UK Government could in theory devolve VAT-setting powers to Holyrood.Appearing later before Holyroods committee conveners, the First Minister said there was too much risked attached to the VAT calculations involved.She said: ldquoWe want as many powers as possible to lie with parliament. On VAT, the current proposal doesnrsquot devolve any power over VAT to the Scottish Parliament.ldquoThe decisions around the rates and levels of VAT remain reserved. This is simply about assigning a portion of the revenues from VAT to the Scottish Government budget with consequent reductions in the block grant funding.ldquoThe concern here comes from the methodology. There is never intended to be any real outturn data that will guide the decision. It is based on estimates.ldquoWhile that in normal times would give rise to concerns, in a time where there is such instability as the moment, largely because of Brexit, then proceeding, in the Scottish Governmentrsquos judgment, could absolutely result in a signicant hit to the Scottish budget.\"She went on: \"I would stress the pointthere is no power here. Itrsquos not about not taking on a power or postponing a power, itrsquos about a way of calculating the Scottish budget that has enormous risk attached to it.ldquoIf the UK is leaving the European Union that opens up discussions as to whether, instead of a VAT assignment, we should have proper devolution of VAT and thatrsquos part of the discussion we may want to have in the period ahead.\"So wersquore being very open and frank with the committee when it comes to our fundamental and quite profound concerns we have about the implications for the Scottish budget.Tory MSP Murdo Fraser said Ms Sturgeon was running a ldquo-to-sender government.He said: ldquoItrsquos bad enough that she handed back social security powers earlier this year, then suddenly decided she wanted nothing to do with control over air departure tax this week.ldquoNow we learn the SNP government doesnrsquot even have the wherewithal to cope with the VAT assignment it so furiously demanded previously.

The SNP need to have a long hard talk with themselves in the mirror.ldquoThis is a dramatic U-turn that shows they are turning their backs on creating a more powerful Scotland within the UK.ldquoThey are throwing away opportunities on taxation and social security for a more federal system and in doing so stopping Scotland becoming a more powerful part of the UK.\""},{"url":null,"title":"jim-wallace-gains-outweigh-the-mistakes-in-scottish-parliaments-first-two-decades","story":"It was an arresting thought. Now, as we look back over  years to the first Scottish Parliamentary election, it is surely unthinkable that we should ever turn the clock back. And in an age when politicians and political institutions are regularly under attack, perhaps one of the most signicant achievements is that our Parliament is so embedded in Scotlandrsquos political landscape.Its achievements go much further than that. One doesnrsquot have to have approved of all the legislation passed since , but the legislative record of the Parliament is impressive compared to what would have been achievedWestminster had continued to find time for only one or two Scottish measures in a year.Within weeks, the new Parliament had passed the Mental Health Act to plug a signicant legal loophole. It undertook long overdue legislation on land reform. It implemented a host of outstanding Scottish Law Commission proposals.We created National Parks. We opened new railway lines. We provided a Freedom of Information regime, more open and robust than applies to UK public bodies.We led the way in the UK in effecting a ban on smoking in public places. Scotland continues to lead the way in promoting a presumption against very short prison sentences.Moreover, the experience of many who seek to lobby or simply have their voices heard, is that government, ministers and officials, are much closer and more accessible.I recall a visit to Barcelona in the early s, when Scotlandrsquos business community was generally still hostile to any kind of devolution. Something may have been gained in the translation, but our Catalan business hosts said that one of their perceived advantages of devolved government was that ldquothe bums were closer to kick. Many Scottish Ministers over the last  years may attest to that.Notwithstanding achievements, from the Parliamentrsquos earliest days, we had to cope with brickbats and criticism. Perhaps we oversold what could be achieved ndash or at least the time it would take to make a dference. The reality was that neither the Parliament nor the Government took over full legislative and executive powers until st July ndash almost two months after the election.During that time, we scored own goals like minting medals, but some housekeeping was essential. Without fixing allowances, our staff couldnrsquot be paid. But the perception was one of self-serving MSPs, no better than their Westminster counterparts. And the building project dogged us for at least five years, even although the plan and contract had been inherited from Westminster.One of the early controversies was the decision to repeal ldquosection A, which forbade teaching of homosexuality in schools. Having been in the Commons when this particularly pernicious piece of legislation was originally passed, I had no doubt that it was right to end it. But repeal had not been mentioned in either coalition partyrsquos manesto, and the announcement without preparing the ground, nor engaging in prior consultation broke our own rules about the importance of consultation in policy making.Some might argue that in other policy areas, there was too much consultation, which made politics boring but on an issue such as the right of responsible access to land, I believe that extensive discussion with interested parties brought about a well- balanced piece of legislation, which has stood the test of time.I firmly believed that Parliamentrsquos Committees had a crucial role to play, both in holding Ministers to account and in scrutinising legislation. My experience in the first years of the Parliament was that Committees were influential and effective. I had to bring in a Bill to add a religion question to the  Census, after the Equal Opportunities Committeeturned me over when I tried to defend a cabinet decision not to include such a question. My perception, and what I hear from current Parliamentarians, is that the SNPrsquos well acclaimed discipline has robbed Committees of much of their robustness in challenging the administration. Going forward, it is to be hoped that Committees will rediscover their earlier zeal for effective scrutiny.Looking back  years, I recall an election campaign where we discussed issues of everyday importance to Scotlandrsquos people over a wide range of important domestic areas, where the new Parliament had powers. It was a refreshing change from the many general elections Irsquod fought, where the constitutional question dominated, evenit wasnrsquot ranked high in polls identying votersrsquo concerns.

A week and a half ago, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon used her speech at the SNP conference to declare a ldquoclimate emergency. This followed meetings with young climate change campaigners who had gone on strike from school to get across the message that adults were ruining the planet. Scotland was already a world leader in tackling climate change, said the FM, and having announced an emergency she pledged that Scotland would live up to its responsibility to tackle it.Act now or risk devastationThis week, in what was punted as a measure of her dedication, she dumped a manesto commitment to cut air passenger duty.

Those who drive too close and are caught face three penalty points on their licence. A reasonable enough response to such thoughtless actions.But thoughtlessness is not the sole preserve of drivers. It is not unusual to see cyclists travelling in packs that are dficult to pass, causing frustration among motorists. On my way into work there is a stretch of road that includes dedicated cycle lanes. It cost a small fortune to create them, and the disruption caused lasted for months, yet a lot of cyclists will not use them.

The naming ceremony is planned for September .Graham Sinclair, chairman of the council’s development and infrastructure committee, said: “Like the celebrated explorer John Rae, some fitting names from Orkney’s past feature on the shortlist for the new vessel and I would encourage folk to take part in the poll.“With harbour business thriving in Orkney, this is an opportune time to replace an ageing pilot launch with a more modern, capable, and reliable vessel. Like her predecessors, she will give us the capability to deliver a -hour, year-round pilotage service in the very challenging waters around Orkney.

Taking inspiration from Orkney’s Norse roots, Highland Park embarked on an adventure to open the new shop, he explained.Patricia Retson, said: “It was an honour and a pleasure to open the new Highland Park store. I hope to see many more visitors discover Orkney and Highland Park’s exciting history.”Mr Craig joined Ms Retson to mark the occasion with a reading of a traditional Viking poem.Mr Craig, added: “We’re excited to open the doors to our new shop and share even more of our world with our visitors. It felt fitting, on a day believed to be about embarking on new adventures for our Nordic ancestors, that we’ve embarked on ours.”“We could think of no better ambassador to open our new store than Patricia. She retired from her role as Senior VP and Education Host at the Highland Park Distillery in April, having helped us create a multi award-winning visitor experience. Patricia’s commitment to the industry and passion for our rich history makes her a true modern day Viking Soul.”Orkney-based photographer and digital influencer Kendra Towns is the first to feature her collection of images inspired by the light on the islands.Seven new members of staff have been employed, with an additional four members joining the team during the summer season.Further details in the Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It’s a large stone cross marking Flora MacDonald’s grave, known, of course, for assisting the escape of Bonnie Prince Charlie, although comparably little is known for certain about her own le, and her motivations have been interpreted in dfering ways.The stone, it is said paid for by public donations, looms huge and solidly, staking its claim to a bit of horizon as waves roll in the background. Far from most tourist hot spots, it is situated in Kilmuir Cemetery near the Trotternish Peninsula. It’s remote enough for visitors to starkly appreciate the wildness of Scottish nature at its most bold, and our inidual smallness next to battering wind, roaring sea, and historical legend assaulting the senses all at once.But it feels poignant not only for the setting or the story, but because it is a monument to a woman. Many monuments have prestige quite often they’ve been designed to demonstrate the wealth of traders and patrons. Not all have the same power to inspire, or come anywhere near it.The ability to evoke shivers comes from this comparative rarity it feels not only a monument to MacDonald but a reminder that, often as quietly and remotely as the setting of this marker, the women of Scotland have also shaped history.: Alternative map of Scotland renames famous landmarks after notable womenAuthor Sara Sheridan’s new book, Where are the Women  reimagines a Scotland where plentul monuments, streets and natural wonders take the names of women. Look up a part of Scotland and it will tell you of local women who achieved remarkable things in art, science, social movements and professional fields, those who played a role in history in other ways, or who were persecuted as witches. Almost none of them have a monument in their honour Sheridan has imagined strolling dedicated walkways, observing plaques, and looking upon celebratory fountains.“Follow the bronze arrows to see women who influenced the area and indeed the world.” If we followed the author’s directions, we could come across, for example, a walkway in Glasgow Green culminating in Maggie Moffat, one of the earliest Scottish Suffragettes to be incarcerated, or a window in Dundee’s St Paul’s Cathedral depicting Margaret Blackwood, founder of Disability Income Group Scotland. Women achieving would be visible everywhere, built into the world around us. Isn’t that a powerful thought It’s a great bit of research, spanning centuries of poor archiving and relegation to footnotes and asides. I’ll consult it whenever I travel around the country, to note who came before and what they did, imprinting their lives onto spaces that have kept no visible trace of them. It’s moving to consider how it would feel were Sheridan’s imaginary monuments real, and modern citizens habitually moved among not only physical reminders of historic acts but the very idea itself that excellence takes the form of women.: Scotland’s forgotten women deserve a place in history – Brian FergusonStatues are a monument to genuine achievement in many cases and great inventions have come in eras women were socially dissuaded or literally barred from pursuing professions. At other times, men considered great have stood on others’ shoulders. Wealthy merchants profiting from the slave trade loom large in landmark buildings. Few poor men – or women – have statues dedicated to them, unless you consider clusters of unnamed soldiers representing war dead. The average person probably couldn’t tell you the names, far less the stories, of very many statues dotted around their town. For most of us they are sleeping sculptural giants we walk right past. I haven’t always felt that campaigns to build new statues are the best focus of feminist energy, but replicating the image of men across our grandest squares and parks has contributed to our cultural ideas about who is taken seriously. We have placed our collective esteem in the image of man, dedicated totems, and rewarded with the enduring honour of names strewn across our maps. One might think, from walking around, that no women live here, far less have achieved anything.In the notes, Sheridan describes her research process, coming across book after book repeating the same stories of men. There are hidden accomplishments in every city and town we walk through. Efforts like Sheridan’s help draw Scotland’s women out of historical invisibility.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why deposit return scheme for cans and bottles should be win win leader comment","story":"The decision to introduce a deposit- scheme for aluminium and steel cans and plastic and glass bottles is welcome and long overdue.The decision to introduce a deposit- scheme for aluminium and steel cans and plastic and glass bottles is welcome and long overdue.It has always been a scandal that we have thrown away vast quantities of a valuable material like aluminium in particular. And it will be an even greater scandalwe fail to take such steps to reduce the amount of waste plastic getting into the natural world, given we have belatedly realised just how much damage it is causing.While Scotland is set to become the first part of the UK to introduce the scheme, similar ones have been operating around the world for some time. And indeed many people will remember the days when there was a deposit on glass bottles in the UK. So there is no reason why we cannot make deposits work now and a number of reasons why we should do so.: Green groups and businesses clash over Scottish bottle depositschemeAnnouncing the Scottish Government’s intention to put legislation before MSPs, Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham rightly cited the “global climate emergency” as one reason.But waste in any form is an inefficiency and there are economic benefits to be made from recycling valuable and useful materials. It has even been suggested recently that rubbish dumps could be mined for some of the materials they contain, so wasteful have we been.There is a general acceptance by the public of the need to recycle and a financial incentive – coupled with better facilities – will make a dference. It really should be a ‘win-win’ for all concerned and the sooner it is introduced, the better.: Scotland’s deposit- system: how it will workHowever, the one potential problem is the requirement for retailers todeposits to shoppers and deal with the used cans and bottles. The Scottish Retail Consortium warned the inclusion of glass in the scheme would be “an enormous burden”, particularly for small shops. High street retailers have been having a tough time of late and should not be made to pay a price for this scheme. Indeed it could be an opportunity to help them. After all,they are providing a service, could they not be given some form of payment for that  Reverse vending machines are used effectively in places like Germany and could simply the process considerably.Huge structural changes to our economy are underway as part of what is being called a new industrial revolution.

The decision to ‘democratise the Games’ was taken on Sunday at the SHGA half-yearly meeting in Braemar following a discussion with Event Scotland which can provide up to  per cent of funding.SHGA has now asked its members to run athletic events on either a handicap basis or to have separate events for men and women. It is also creating a number of new leagues for women, so that at the end of the season athletes competing regularly will get rewarded with cash prizes and trophies, the same as men.Launching the new policy, Ian Grieve, SHGA secretary, said: “Talking to people and looking at what was in the press, we found that there wasn’t a good awareness of what Highland games can offer female athletes, and there was more we can do to help that situation.“We get lots of male and only some female competitors, but would like to see a lot more.”Mr Grieve said his organisation had contacted over  athletic clubs across Scotland to make athletes aware of the changes, as well as printing and distributing , calendars of events and have listed details on their website.Mr Grieve added: “The aim of all this is to raise the number of female athletes at the Highland games,they come along they will be made very welcome.”Rhoda Grant, Scottish Labour MSP for the Highlands and Islands, who campaigned for changes to make the Games more erse and inclusive, said: “I am very pleased to hear this news from the SHGA. “Obviously it is disappointing that it took this long for them to get to this point, but the SHGA have now seen sense to join the rest of us in the st century and allow women to compete on a level playing field at Highland Games events.“With growing levels of inactivity and obesity in the country, any chance to encourage participation in sports should be promoted, as well as the huge boost Highland Games give to the economy of many of our remote and rural areas. “To exclude women would be just another hurdle that women in sport have to face.“The Highland Games are something that draws in many tourists from around the world and I am glad that this year we will have a positive message about women in sport.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"green groups and businesses clash over scottish bottle deposit return scheme","story":"A row has broken out over the introduction of glass bottles into Scotlands new depositscheme.Details of the DRS, announced in Holyrood today, revealed that glass bottles had been added to the list of drinks containers which shops will be expected to collect and recycle.In a statement to Parliament this afternoon, Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the scheme would also involve all shops which sell drinks offering a p deposit refundnew legislation is passed by the Scottish Parliament later this year.The scheme is expected to be up and running by  and will include aluminium and steel cans as well as plastic and glass bottles. But while the announcement was welcomed by environmental groups, the Scottish Retail Consortium said the addition of glass bottles to the DRS would add an additional £m per year to operating costs. Richard Walker, Managing Director at Iceland also urged the government to reconsider including glass in the scheme and the Scottish Beer  Pub Association said the move was \"deeply disappointing\".Addressing Parliament, Ms Cunningham said that Scotland was the first part of the UK to outline the design of a depositscheme \"one that is ambitious in scale and scope, and which gives the people of Scotland a clear and straightforward way to do their bit for the environment.\"She added: “There is a global climate emergency and people across Scotland have been calling, rightly, for more ambition to tackle it and safeguard our planet for future generations. I am therefore delighted to confirm that I intend to implement a system covering PET – the most common form of plastic packaging – aluminium and steel cans, and glass, with a deposit refund set at p.“Supported by international evidence our plans for Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme are gathering pace with widespread consensus demonstrating that a well-run, appropriately-targeted scheme could improve the environment, change attitudes to recycling and litter, and support a more circular economy.”Environmental campaigners welcomed the announcement about the scope of the system, with the Have You Got The Bottle  campaign, suggesting that the DRS could ert around , empty cans and bottles from litter to recycling every day . Jenni Hume, the campaign manager, said: “The deposit system set out today is a major step in the right direction, setting the pace for the rest of the UK, and it will have a substantial positive impact on litter and recycling.\"Its great news that the Scottish Government are ready for the system to expand in future to include more drinks containers, which will be both more effective and easier for the public to use.\" Calum Duncan, of the Marine Conservation Society, said: \"Our beach litter data highlights a shocking amount of glass items found on Scotlands beaches, an average of  pieces for every m of beach surveyed during the Great British Beach Clean .\"We are very pleased with todays announcement that the system will include glass, along with some plastics and aluminium, and all sizes of those drinks containers.\" And Dr Richard Dixon, Director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: “This is great news: the system announced today will provide a huge boost for recycling of bottles and cans, reduce litter across Scotland, and save both materials and climate change emissions.This is a great start to getting the public to do even more recycling and it is the kind of system which can be expanded to other products over time.“This scheme will set a good benchmark to influence the thinking for a similar scheme for England and the ideal is that the two schemes will eventually work in the exactly the same way.\"But Richard Walker, Managing Director at Iceland, said that while the ambitious DRS scheme was commendable, and will be supported by the public, it should reconsider including glass. “A scheme incorporating glass would put further pressure on high street retailers due to the size and scope of equipment required to recycle glass, and the requirement to manage additional health and safety concerns,\" he said. \"As well as this, the recycling of glass would have the inevitable consequence of erting footfall from an already precarious high street, due to the customer inconvenience of recycling heavy glass bottles in stores without parking.\"The existing kerbside glass collection scheme is effective and widely used, and we’d encourage the Scottish Government to focus their efforts on the immediate need to recycle plastics.”Head of Policy with the SRC, Ewan MacDonald-Russell, echoed Mr Walkers remarks. He said: \"A successful DRS, working within a wider comprehensive strategy to reduce waste following producer responsibility reform, would herald an opportunity to drive further increases in recycling and reduce litter, over and above the existing household kerbside system.“However, we are concerned the disappointing design unveiled by ministers may make that unachievable. The inclusion of glass will add an additional £ million per annum to the cost of running a DRS a cost that will end up being paid by consumers. Glass is a dficult, bulky, and heavy material to manage and will be an enormous burden, especially for those operating from smaller stores.\"SBPA chief executive Brigid Simmonds said that while it supports a DRS for plastic containers, “the inclusion of glass containers inside the system is, however, deeply disappointing to our members and the wider industry. Including glass inside a DRS substantially increases costs and adds complexity to the system. This will impact consumers and creates signicant challenges for Scotland’s pubs. Many pubs simply do not have the storage space for glass. It cannot be crushed and therefore the storage requirements are huge for smaller premises in pubs or small shops.\" While Gavin Partington, director general of the British Soft Drinks Association said: “The inclusion of glass raises costs and introduces a complexity which creates unnecessary risk to the successful launch of a DRS in Scotland.\"The government is currently being advised by the Deposit Return Scheme Implementation Advisory Group providing industry input and guidance on how the scheme will work for consumers, producers, retailers and the hospitality industry. Around . billion single use drinks containers are sold in Scotland each year, and the depositscheme is expected to encourage more sustainable use and recycling. Scottish Liberal Democrat energy spokesperson Liam McArthur welcomed the announcement as \"the right thing to do to end our throwaway culture\", and Scottish Labours environment spokesperson, Claudia Beamish, said: \"It is right that glass is included, and there will be producer responsibility through a not for profit operating model.\"The move to include glass was also welcomed by Truls Haug, managing director of TOMRA Collection Solutions UK  Ireland. He said: “This type of scheme – with as few restrictions as possible, which is convenient and easy to use – will achieve the bestrates in our experience.“For that reason we welcome the inclusion of glass in a DRS for Scotland. I can confirm that TOMRA will have a small footprint machine for convenience stores that can accept PET, can and glass ready for the Scottish rollout. This will have an even smaller footprint than those being trialled in Scotland today.\"However the Federation of Small Businesses also criticised the government for ruling out an exemption for the smallest shops. Colin Borland, FSB director of devolved nations, said: “A bottle deposit scheme is undoubtedly a popular idea. But it is understandable that those that run the very smallest shops have concerns about storage.\"That’s why we’ve been working with officials, underlining the importance of an opt-out for those without appropriate capacity. We’re unhappy that the Scottish Government hasn’t taken on board our concerns, despite a commitment to address the problems such a scheme poses for small retailers. Ministers need to explain to those that run the smallest shops how this scheme will work for them.”Draft legislation on the scheme will be published later this year.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove unveils plans to take control of holyrood cash","story":"Radical plans to hold back tens of millions of pounds from Holyrood and allow UK ministers instead to spend the cash directly north of the Border have been set out by environment secretary Michael Gove.The Scots-born MP is among the front-runners to replace Theresa May when she stands down.He insists his plan for Westminster to be allowed to spend Treasury funding in traditionally devolved areas would strengthen the Union.It could see Westminster funding projects in areas such as education and farming.The plan would also tackle unrest at Westminster over the Scottish Government’s claim that it alone “speaks for Scotland”.“There’s a rule that we’re currently bound by, a Treasury rule which means that the UK Government can’t spend money in areas that are devolved,” Mr Gove told a fringe event at the Tory conference yesterday.“So that means when it comes to promoting culture or supporting agriculture and fisheries, the money has to go through the Scottish Government.“I think that once we’ve given the Scottish Government their fair share, the UK Government should be able to spend additional money on the basis of need for projects that will strengthen the Union.” Mr Gove said every government department thinks of itself as a UK department.Speaking during a question-and-answer session with Stirling MP Stephen Kerr, Mr Gove also hinted UK ministers could start spending in devolved areas.“The department of education deals primarily with schools in England, but actually the strength of our knowledge base across the United Kingdom matters. “There are English students in Scottish Universities and there are Scottish academics in English Universities- we need to make sure that the money that we spend and the initiatives that we carry out here are badged as UK Government.“The Scottish Government is very good at using money that it gets form Westminster to claim it is delivering them - actually it is the UK Government that is providing this and leading the way on budgets.”He hinted that more Scottish MPs would be handed ministerial roleshe replaces Theresa May“We shouldmake sure the Westminster government is seen as representative of every part of the United Kingdom and we’re prepared to energetically say to the SNP ‘You don’t speak for Scotland.’”“The whole idea that you say you are the Scottish Government and therefore you are the only legitimate voice that speaks for Scotland is wrong.“Of course we respect the devolution settlement and we respect their capacity to make policy as long they have a majority.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"snp may seek delay to devolution of vat revenues to scotland","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The handover to Scotland of flagship new budget measures could be delayed by the Scottish Government amid concerns of a multi-million pound cash shortfall.It prompted fresh criticism that the SNP Government was \"sending back\" powers to Westminster, after demanding their handover, following the recent delay to new welfare controls by three years.

We have the worst levels by a country mile.Figures assembled by the debt relief charity Step Change indicate that while the average Scottish mortgage debt is £,, in the constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch it is a whopping £,.Even within the Highlands as a whole that is a shocking sum # the Highland average of mortgage arrears is £,. That is almost twice the national average. But in Skye, we are told, our arrears are six times the national average, with almost a third of mortgage payers affected.We should introduce a note of caution. Step Change has extrapolated its conclusions from a small sample of the population. It is possible,not likely, that things are not quite that bad.Unless Step Change is completely off the chart, things are nonetheless bad enough. And our indebtedness extends beyond house payments. The Highlands and Islands have the highest levels of electricity bill arrears in Scotland, something which will be owed to our climate and our extortionate bills, and which has already been advertised by our uniquely high levels of fuel poverty.Overall, people in the Highlands and Islands are twice as much in debt as where in Scotland, and people in the north-west of Scotland are even more in hock to lenders and to utility companies.Those astonishingly high figures for mortgage debt # and therefore, of course, of potential foreclosures and homelessness # in this region cannot easily be explained away. It is the result of a combination of factors.House prices in Skye and the western Highlands began to rise, from a low base, in the s.The speed of growth took everybody by surprise. A simple crofthouse which in the early s might have sold for £, or less can now fetch ten times that amount.The selling price was dictated more by location than the quality of the property. At first the holiday home sector played the most active part in pushing up prices.Throw a st century tourist boom and all of its ancillary money spinners such as buy-to-let properties and Airbnb into the mix, add a resident population which has grown by  per cent since the s, and the result is a skewed and uncontrollable local housing market.It is a market into which local working people are obliged to enter. Everybody needs somewhere to live. Local housing associations have done a good job in offering affordable rented homes. Clearly, however, Skye and the north-west have never recovered from the Tory assault on local authority #council# housing in the s. In the absence of sufficient decent social housing, people have to buy.The result has been that young people, in particular, have been obliged to enter what is now one of the most expensive and volatile housing markets in the United Kingdom. Those same young people live in a region with some of the worst-paid and insecure jobs in the country.That is not a formula for a stable society. Low wages and high house prices, in a region where the general cost of living is also high, provides the perfect recipe for unsustainable levels of mortgage arrears, as well as unpaid electricity and other bills # and that is exactly what we have got.There are two obvious solutions. They will not be achieved overnight, but they should be pushed quickly up the agenda of all of our local businesses and elected representatives.It is clear that the tourism riches that have recently descended on Skye and the north-west are not evenly distributed. If we want people to stay and live and work here, they must be paid at least a living wage: a salary which will enable them to buy houses.And central and local government must invest much more in social housing. That will depend upon finance from the Scottish Government and the initiative of Highland Council. The £ million pledged this week by the former towards local authority housing is a good start. But there are  councils in Scotland. The money cannot be ided equally. Priority must be given to regions such as this which suffer most gravely from unaffordable housing.

It gives us that bit of extra flexibility to meet the extra demand because there are days, especially in the summer, when we could have three or four flights a day.#Loganair must be given a minimum of four weeks# notice to arrange the additional flights, which will be rolled over into the following yearthey remain unused.To create the bank of  flights, the Scottish Government are to remove the second daily service on a Wednesday during January and February. The Sunday service is being increased from one to two daily flights from the end of May until the beginning of September.Mr Matheson also announced that two seats per day will be reserved on the first flight of the day from Barra to Glasgow and on the second flight of the day from Glasgow to Barra for use by passengers travelling for medical purposes. Any seats not used within three days of the date of travel are made available for general sale.The changes are part of the next contract to operate the Scottish Government-supported air routes from Glasgow to Barra, Tiree and Campbeltown. The invitation to tender for the £ million Public Service Obligation contract, which will run for four years from th October , was published on th April.Mr Matheson said: #These flights play a vital role for the remote communities they serve, so we have spoken with passengers to see how we can make improvements and will keep ticket prices low given the leline nature of the services.#The people of Barra and Tiree told us they face capacity issues over the busy summer period, so the new contract will remove a number of little-used flights to create a bank of rotations that can be deployed at the discretion of these communities.#It will also formalise a scheme for the Barra service which reserves seats for passengers travelling for medical purposes, following a successful trial.#I look forward to this contract being awarded later this year and the benefits that come with it being realised by passengers.#"},{"url":null,"title":"turnouts announced in mid and east antrim","story":"Voter turnout has been announced for the seven District Electoral Areas across Mid and East Antrim Borough Council.Of the , eligible electorate in the Ballymena ward, , votes were polled, resulting in a turnout of . per cent.

If anyone wants to come along, they are very welcome.“We raise any housing issues with Newington Housing Association and have a place on the Girdwood community forum.“We also set up a neighbourhood watch scheme which has become quite important to ensure the local community is a safer place for all.“We also run a number of events throughout the year including a family fun day to raise money for the children’s cancer unit at the Royal Victoria Hospital.”More recently, TDK Community Group have set up a food bank to provide a vital leline for the local community.The food bank operates from a Portakabin at the back of the Duncairn Centre for Culture and Arts every Monday and Wednesday from am to pm.The service is entirely run by volunteers from the TDK area with help from Rev Karen Sethuraman from Soul Space, who are also based in the Duncairn Centre.Rosemary is hoping the food bank will provide much-needed support to those in need in the local community.“The Duncairn kindly provided us with a portacabin and together with volunteers we done up and painted.“We felt there was a great need in the local community for a food bank, particularly with so many people getting disqualied for benefits and universal credit.“We found many people were running low on money each month.

That means that  per cent of the most affordable homes are no longer available in West Belfast.”Cllr Corr continued: “The reality for us and for many many people in West Belfast who are looking for a home is the massive dference in rents between the Housing Executive houses and housing association houses,” he said.Cllr Corr said he has had numerous tenants seeking advice over their current housing association rents and that the monetary dference between that and a Housing Executive tenancy agreement could be between £ and £ per week.“Rents are decided by a housing association board, whose homes are part-funded by the Department for Communitiesbut who also need to repay loans taken out for house construction, while the Housing Executive is a totally dferent set up.“What you are finding is that housing associations are pricing out working families, especially people on low paid income who cannot afford their rents.“People are stuck. In extreme cases people have had to give up their tenancies and go back to live with their parents in what is now being referred to as the ‘boomerang generation’.“We need a radical overhaul, to increase massively the amount of affordable housing, and we need to have housing-led regeneration for many disadvantaged areas.“People who are working are forced into private rental as they can’t get a mortgage. If you can’t get a mortgage in West Belfast you are forced to look to Glenavy, Crumlin or Lisburn.

You will still be able to work, study, draw your pension and access social security and public services in the UK. “Above all, you will be welcome. “And we welcome the similar commitment the government of Ireland makes to British citizens in Ireland. “Today’s announcement reflects close work with Ireland over the last two years to ensure that the CTA and associated rights are maintained, no matter the terms of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. “This is the culmination of that good progress.”Mr Coveney said: “Today marks an important moment for the long-standing Common Travel Area arrangement between our two countries. “The CTA has provided rights and privileges to Irish and British citizens for nearly a century. “However, it has not before been formalised in this way.“Many of us have personal experience of the CTA in our daily lives. “This MOU demonstrates and confirms the commitment of both governments to maintaining the CTA in all circumstances. “It provides clarity and assurance for citizens of both countries that the way in which British and Irish citizens can live and work freely across these islands will not change.” The Tanaiste added: “The CTA is a practical demonstration of the enduring strength of the British-Irish relationship and of our people to people ties. “I want to assure British citizens living in Ireland that they are welcome and truly valued here, as is their contribution to Ireland and Irish le. “British citizens will continue to be able to travel freely, live, study and work in Ireland into the future. “I welcome the similar commitment and welcome of the UK Government for Irish citizens in Britain.”The intergovernmental conference is provided for by the  Good Friday Agreement and facilitates bilateral co-operation between Britain and Ireland.It was resurrected after seldom being used because of the absence of a breakthrough at Stormont.The fresh powersharing talks process began in Belfast on Tuesday.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Fresh talks began in Belfast on Tuesday Leaders of the five main parties acknowledged mounting public impatience and anger at a stalemate that has left the region without a ing devolved government for more than two years.They held a short round-table meeting at Stormont House on Tuesday afternoon for the first exchanges of a new process initiated by the UK and Irish governments.The process will involve agenda-setting and stock-taking meetings between the five leaders and two governments at least once a week, with five working groups to focus on the detail of key disputes at the heart of the deadlock.The last DUP Sinn Fein-led powersharing coalition imploded in January  when the late Martin McGuinness quit as Sinn Fein deputy first minister amid a row about a botched green energy scheme.The fallout over the Renewable Heat Incentivewas soon overtaken by disputes over the Irish language, the region’s ban on same-sex marriage and the toxic legacy of the Troubles.Six previous initiatives to restore devolution failed to find consensus."},{"url":null,"title":"man on belfast to dublin bus asked for passport","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Among others breaching rules were nine Cabinet ministers and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.Exactly  years after the MPs expenses scandal, the body set up to ensure greater transparency has been accused of trying to prevent openness, rather than ensuring it.The Dailyreported that the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority tried to stop disclosure of MPs use of Parliamentary credit cards on the grounds it would have a \"chilling effect\" on its relationship with MPs and reduce public confidence in the regulatory system.But a former High Court judge reversed the decision, saying that the risk of \"embarrassing\" MPs was no reason to keep the information secret.Since the  election,  MPs have all had their credit cards suspended, documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show.Many are repeat offenders - including Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd - and nine MPs have had their card suspended more than  times over the past three years.From Amazon Prime subscriptions to incorrectly claimed rent and household bills, expenses claimed by MPs since  have led to the Parliamentary watchdog suspending their credit cards - the toughest punishment it can issue.Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the committee on standards in public le, said: \"It shows there is either something fundamentally wrong with the system, or weve got a bunch of highly incompetent slovenly MPs who cant keep to the rules.\"The rest of the nation would only expect to have to comply in similar circumstances.\"Parliamentary credit cards were introduced after the  MPs expenses scandal to ensure that MPs spending could be closely monitored and accounted for to the penny.Cards are suspended when MPs break the rules, for example failing to provide receipts to justy payments in the required  days, incorrect spending which does not comply with the rules, and failing to repay money owed to the taxpayer for claims which were not eligible. Mr Paisley said: \"These were historic issues that have each been resolved to the satisfaction of the independent auditor. On the majority of the occasions the card was switched off because of lateness in processing the account. Once the claims were veried the card was reactivated.\"Ms Rudd had her credit card suspended on five occasions between November  and September  while Mr Corbyn has had his card suspended twice - in August  and September .Other MPs who have had their cards suspended include leading Brexiteer Boris Johnson.In total there have been , suspensions of MPs payment cards since the  election."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its about hard work and dedication,\" he said of its joint ninth place.Principal of Castlederg High School Elaine McKelvey said she was \"delighted\" it was the highest-ranking non-grammar school in the league table.\"These results are testimony to the excellent provision for learning made at Castlederg High School by a highly dedicated staff, working in partnership with very supportive parents to ensure the best possible outcome for each young person,\" she said.Mrs McKelvey paid tribute to the hard work and dedication of staff during \"a most challenging period for educational delivery within all schools in Northern Ireland, given the shortfall in capital funding and inequitable remuneration for teaching staff\".\"Most of all though, we are tremendously proud of our pupils and their achievements, noting the breadth of opportunity for the future that such excellent exam results have created for them,\" she added.The Department of Education said the information contained in the league table relating to GCSE results \"does not provide a valid basis for comparing performance between schools, since it takes no account of intakes of the schools or of any other factors that may affect pupil performance\".It added: \"No single measurement can constitute a fair or accurate evaluation of a school, and the figures should be considered in the context of other information about schools and their pupils.\""},{"url":null,"title":"split emerges over single transfer test plan for northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Experience tells us that there is still a long way to go, but this seems to be an important step forward in finally resolving this issue.\"Stephen Elliott is chairman of the Parental Alliance for Choice in Education, which strongly backs the AQE test.\"This is indefensible and it should trouble parents,\" he said.\"Its been a project for the Department of Education - they want to get headmasters to decide this.\"Its remarkable that public sector employees, such as the heads of grammar schools, are interfering in private companies. I think its impossible to combine these tests - theyre trying to measure dferent things. Theyre trying to make the AQE test less reliable. AQE provides parents with past papers, but this would no longer be an option.\"Weve had  years of AQE tests that have essentially been flawless. If its not broke, you dont need to fix it.\"In June last year concerns were also raised by the AQEs chief examiner at the time, Dr Hugh Morrison.Having designed the AQE test and worked free of charge for  years, he said he was \"shocked\" when the consultation was announced. He added at the time he had been given reassurances from both organisations he would be included in any dialogue."},{"url":null,"title":"government to fund removal of grenfellstyle cladding from private highrises","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Latest Government figures show that  private buildings out of  identied with the cladding after the fire in June  have yet to start removing the material. Developers and building owners, including Pemberstone, Aberdeen Asset Management, Barratt Developments, Fraser Properties, Legal  General, Mace and Peabody, were highlighted for having fully borne the costs for their buildings.

He will simply be known as Master Archie Mountbatten-Windsor. As the first born son of a duke, Archie could have become Earl of Dumbarton - one of Harrys subsidiary titles - or Lord Archie Mountbatten-Windsor. A source said: \"They have chosen not to use a courtesy title.\" The decision fits in with Harry and Meghans desire to give their son as normal a le as possible despite his royal heritage. Harry, who has admitted he once \"wanted out\" of the royal family, has spoken in the past of how he was always more comfortable being Captain Wales in the Army than being Prince Harry. Archie means \"genuine\", \"bold\" and \"brave\", and is German in origin. Short for Archibald, it is now given as a name in its own right. Harrison means \"son of Harry\" so is likely to be a tribute to the duke. It is English in origin and famous Harrisons include Star Wars actor Harrison Ford. Archie is not entitled to be an HRH or a prince, due to rules set out more than  years ago by George V. The couples @SussexRoyal Instagram account announced: \"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are pleased to announce they have named their first born child: Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. \"This afternoon Their Royal Highnesses introduced Her Majesty The Queen to her eighth great-grandchild at Windsor Castle. The Duke of Edinburgh and The Duchess mother were also present for this special occasion.\" The family of three were pictured in a black and white snap showing off baby Archie to the Queen and Philip, alongside Meghans mother Doria Ragland. Harry and Meghans first born, who is seventh in line to the throne, made his world debut with his besotted parents at Windsor Castle yesterday. Proud mother Meghan described him as having the \"sweetest temperament\", while a delighted Harry called him \"our own little bundle of joy\". The duchess added: \"Its magic, its pretty amazing. I have the two best guys in the world, so Im really happy.\" As is the custom for royal babies, Harry and Meghan will have shared news of their choice with the monarch before releasing it to the public. The duke and duchesss son arrived overdue on Monday, May  at .am, weighing lb oz. Baby Sussex made his debut wrapped in a merino wool shawl made by the same small, family-run company that was used by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for their children. The hand-finished shawl made by the Nottingham company GH Hurt  Son, based in Chilwell, is called the Leaves And Flowers Baby Shawl, with shell detailing on each edge, and costs £. Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis were all swaddled in shawls made by the company in their first appearances on the doorstep of the Lindo Wing at St Marys Hospital in London.

Cllr Curran said space in an existing refrigeration unit is exhausted and more is required.Meanwhile, former South Down MP, Margaret Ritchie, who recently visited Ardglass, is also pleased that local fishermen can now fish in Dundalk Bay.She thanked the Minister for Fisheries and Marine in Dublin, political colleagues in Daacuteil Eacuteireann and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood for making representations to ensure legislation was enacted.She added: ldquoThis will ensure that fishing, which is the leblood of the Ardglass community, can continue unhindered. This is also good news for the local economy.Development plans for Ardglass include relocating Ardglass trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the village harbour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Artist chosen to display work at renowned exhibition in Dublin  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK artist who is the youngest ever member of the Ulster Water Colour Society is to exhibit in Irelandrsquos biggest and most prestigious art exhibition next month.Connor Maguire has recently been selected to show his self-portrait entitled lsquoMan in the Hatrsquo at the Royal Hibernian Academy in Dublin. It will be the second time he has been chosen to exhibit along with Irelandrsquos finest artists.The  year-old mdash who is a former De La Salle High student mdash says his painting is a side profile piece which was completed in oils on canvas. Out of a total of , entries submitted to the exhibition, only  or so are successful.Connor was shortlisted last year for the Zurich Portrait prize where he was only one of  artists throughout Ireland to be up for a winning prize of two thousand euros.This gave him the opportunity to exhibit in the National Gallery of Ireland which he describes as being ldquosurreal and a dream come true.Connor said: ldquoOne of my earliest memories is of me scribbling away at a table with my grandfather, Broderick Maguire.ldquoMy grandfather, an accomplished draughtsman, carpenter, designer and painter, could do anything that he applied himself to and introduced me to pencil drawing and charcoal. He inspired and captivated me, seeing what he could accomplish with a pencil and a paintbrush. I attempted to paint as good as he did and believe Irsquom still trying.Connor continued: ldquoI recall my art teacher at high school, Mr McLaughlin, was a terric influence on me too. It was one of the few classes I actually enjoyed.ldquoAfter A-Levels, I took up art at the University of Ulster and have been painting non-stop since. I won the Chairmanrsquos Award in , and have went on to win the Stephens Award, Anna Cheyne Award and Carnathan Galleries Award.ldquoI work three days a week at the Assumption Grammar as an art technician. I work with the students, helping them explore print making and they seem to love it.Connor also works steadily as a freelance artist, specialising in painting from watercolours to oils, printmaking in the form of woodcuts, linocuts, drawings in charcoal and graphite exhibiting, and in case he might have a spare moment or two, he is a professional picture framer too.Most of Connorrsquos paintings are inspired by themes of portraiture and he has a keen eye for figure and character in familiar settings like a simple family meal. He takes inspiration form the essence of someone which he can capture through some serious study.Taking part in the exhibition, which is now in its th year, is another stepping block to Connor gaining recognition on the international stage where interest has been coming from American art curator, Didi Menendez and the RJD Gallery in New York.Both notable art critics and buyers who he has been in contact with could well result in him exhibiting further afield.Connor has also took part in BBC Radio  programmes talking about his work with broadcasting journalists, Perminder Khatkar and Helen Marks.Last year he featured on BBC rsquos lsquoThe Arts Showrsquo talking about his work with Marie Louise Muir.He says it was a ldquocool feeling to be featured alongside actor Ciaran Hynds who was featured in the same programme.Connor was shortlisted as Artist of the Year in  in association with Artists  Illustrators Magazine, exhibiting in Londonrsquos prestigious Mall Galleries alongside some of Britainrsquos greatest artists.He was also shortlisted as Artist of the Year in  with the same magazine. winning the West Dean College Award exhibiting again in the Mall Galleries in London.This RHA exhibition will catapult Connor further than he can imagine and said hersquod like to concentrate on portraiture and introduce more figures into the paintings on the theme of realism and experiment on learning new things in printmaking with woodcuts and etching.More of Connorrsquos work can be viewed on his website www.connormaguire..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Bid to boost tourism in Downpatrick area  ","story":"MORE emphasis on tourism promotion across Downpatrick and Lecale has the potential to signicantly enhance the districtrsquos economy, according to a UUP candidate in tomorrowrsquos local council election.Alexander Burgess, who is contesting one of the five seats up for grabs in the Downpatrick DEA, believes more needs to be done to make the most of the arearsquos unique link with St Patrick.Mr Burgess, who was recently joined by his party leader, Robin Swann, on a visit to the centre dedicated to Irelandrsquos patron saint in Downpatrick, is confident that furthering St Patrickrsquos links with Downpatrick and wider Lecale can help promote new business opportunities, including hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation.He is also delighted that planning permission was recently secured for a major new hotel at the site of the former Abbey Lodge development at the Belfast Road on the outskirts of the town.ldquoTourism is the districtrsquos number one economic driver and we are blessed with so many fantastic places to visit in Downpatrick and across the wider district, said Mr Burgess.ldquoMany areas would give all they had to have such an important link with St Patrick. Downpatrick boasts Irelandrsquos only centre dedicated to him but I believe more needs to be done to fully exploit the tourism potential the patron saint offers us.Mr Burgess said additional overnight accommodation in Downpatrick and Lecale was crucial to assisting any new drive to encourage more people to visit and learn about Patrick and the arearsquos rich Patrician heritage.He said having spoken to many people during his election canvass, it is clear there is simply not enough tourism accommodation at present.ldquoIt is rather ironic that while Newry, Mourne and Down Council has quite rightly put tourism at the top of its agenda, there is simply not enough accommodation for people to stay. It is an issue that needs to be addressed, continued Mr Burgess.ldquoThere are already thousands of people visiting the St Patrick Centre every year and how great it would bethere were more places for them to stay to fully exploit what the area has to offer. We already have the Ballydugan Mill hotel on the outskirts of the town and a number of bed and breakfast providers, but we need to capitalise on the lucrative overnight market by providing more bed spaces.Mr Burgess said he hopes that when day-trip tour operators arrange visits to the St Patrick Centre that they will allow additional time for tourists to visit town centre shops, cafes and restaurants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Burgess calls for new centre to be opened  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to open Saintfieldrsquos new community centre immediately.The call has been issued by Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess, who is concerned that weeks after work on the eagerly-anticipated Belfast Road centre was completed, the entrance gates remain locked and the ultra-modern facility lies unused.On the eve of tomorrowrsquos local government election, the Recorder understands that while several opening dates were suggested, agreement could not be reached between the ious parties and that the new centre is not expected to open until the end of this month or early June at the earliest.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is scheduled to hold its annual meeting on May  and it is understood that the new centre will not open before then.A local authority spokesman said as the organisation is currently operating under the restrictions of purdah mdash imposed in the lead-up to an election and which restricts councils from making major announcements ndash the opening will not take place until after the local government poll.Cllr Burgess insists he sees no reason why the centre was not opened before now.ldquoIt is my understanding having spoken to senior council officials that all the work has been completed and it is simply a case of opening the centre. I have also been told that the centre could have opened in February. We are now in May and the entrance gates remain locked. This simply isnrsquot on, he declared.ldquoThe delay in opening a centre which the people of Saintfield helped deliver is inexcusable in my book. Over poundm has been invested in the project and while building work has been completed, the cross-community facility remains closed.Cllr Burgess said there was ample time to arrange the official opening of the centre before purdah kicked in and ahead of tomorrowrsquos election.ldquoWhen the council finally gets around to opening a centre which it has allowed to remain closed for several months, it is essential that it invites all those associated with the project, in particular, those involved with the proposal from the outset.ldquoA lot of people have invested considerable time and effort in this project and it is vital their collective efforts are recognised at the official opening.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoThe people of Saintfield and indeed further afield are perplexed as to why the centre has not opened. Perhaps after purdah ends, Newry, Mourne and Down Council will tell the districtrsquos ratepayers why there has been such an extraordinarily y and, in my opinion, totally unnecessary delay.A local authority spokesman confirmed that no date has yet been agreed for the official opening of the new community centre in Saintfield.He added: As the Council is now operating under the restrictions of lsquopurdahrsquo the centre will not open until after the local council elections have taken place..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call to begin work on Ballynahinch by pass  ","story":"CALLS have been issued for a start on work on Ballynahinchrsquos new poundm by-pass.It comes just days after major gridlock on the main approach roads to the market town over the Easter holiday period in Ballynahinch which is used as a gateway by visitors to Newcastle and the wider Mournes area in particular.Roads officials say they are keen to get on with the job of building the near two-mile by-pass linking the Belfast and Newcastle roads, with Rowallane Ulster Unionist candidate, Walter Lyons, insisting this must happen now.As part of the multi-million project, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road in Ballynahinch.Mr Lyons said the by-pass must be delivered not only to ease town centre gridlock in Ballynahinch, but to encourage new investment and attract more visitors to the area.ldquoThere is no doubt that traffic congestion in the town centre is an impediment to new retail and commercial investment in Ballynahinch and it must be so frustrating for people from Belfast and other areas who have to make their way through the town during bank and public holidays and over the summer to sit in long tailbacks, he said.Mr Lyons, who was recently joined by UUP leader Robin Swann who was visiting the town, said the campaign for the townrsquos by-pass started  years ago and that the scheme must now be delivered.ldquoMoney has been made available for other major road schemes in Northern Ireland while Ballynahinch continues to wait, he declared. ldquoThe congestion in the town centre was as bad as it has been for many years on Easter Monday and we need to address the issue.ldquoIt is clear that the congestion problem is not only impacting on investment in the town but local tourism. My fear is that people will not want to come to our districtthey are continually caught in traffic snarl-ups.Mr Lyons said log-jammed streets could also impact on the ability of the emergency services to respond to major incidents, should one arise.He added: ldquoCongestion in Ballynahinch impacts on a much wider area yet progress on delivering the much-needed by-pass is painfully slow. It is my understanding that the project cannot move to the procurement and construction stages until the necessary funding is available. This needs to happen.ldquoWe need a financial commitment to build the road to benefit the entire district. The congestion is not solely a Ballynahinch problem but,solved, has the capacity to provide major benefits. We have been told that the scheme is shovel ready so letrsquos get on with the job of building the road.Mr Lyons said thatelected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, delivering the scheme will be one of his key priorities. He said delivering the proposed by-pass must also be a council priority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Doubles all round for Wexford men  ","story":"IT was cold and windy at Taylorstown, near Poyntzpass, on Saturday for the annual Newry Point-to-Point races.It proved to a good meeting for Wexford with Barry OrsquoNeil, Jamie Codd and Colin Bowe all recording doubles and also for the Doyle brothers, Donnchadh and Sean.OrsquoNeilrsquos brace saw him record his rd winner of the season, while Codd was chalking up his th success in the All-Ireland ridersrsquo table.Coddrsquos double puts him on the  winner mark in the Northern Ireland Ridersrsquo Regional title race, three ahead of Noel McParlan and Rob James.OrsquoNeil and Bowe got off the mark for the day in the Derrylecka Bedding Centre maiden race for five year-old geldings, the second race of the day.Here, the partnership scored with Cremant, winning in good style from Codd on McGarry, owned by Christine McKnight and trained by her husband, Neil, at Loughbrickland. Third was Snowpiercer, ridden by James OrsquoRourke in place of Rob James.The duo then went on to win the third race, the Seven Stars maiden race for five year-old and upwards mares, with Alice OrsquoByrne coming home seven s clear of Codd on Raddle and Hum. The consistent Moylass and Ben Crawford took third place.Coddrsquos first victory came in the Boydrsquos Stores open race that saw seven go to post.A piece of history was made when his mount Kruzhlinin, owned by Camilla Sharples, who is travelling head girl to Gordon Elliott, became the first horse to win nine races in a season.OrsquoNeil set out to make all on recent Loughbrickland winner Sambremont, but had to be content with a fourth-placed finish. Codd sent his mount clear after the last to beat former champion point-to-pointer Anseanachai Cliste, ridden for the first time by Noel McParlan.

What did happen, though, was the stuff of dreams.He took a whopping six minutes off his PB and his pacing was textbook, averaging . seconds per mile.

completing work on an environmental improvement scheme in Irish Street in Downpatrick has been branded a ldquodisgrace by a local politician.Councillor Dermot Curran has this week called for an urgent meeting to be arranged between traders and senior officials from a number of government departments involved in the project to discuss what went wrong and what can be done to ensure the project is completed as soon as possible.Last week the Recorder revealed that Irish Street traders are furious that work on the project is to take more than twice as long to complete than originally planned.Work to provide new paving, street lighting and street furniture was due to complete at the end of March, but contractors will not now be finished their work until the end of June.And, to compound tradersrsquo frustration, once contractors move off site, Irish Street will be completely closed to traffic for a short period to allow the main road to be resurfaced, taking the scheme into July.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have also arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base and problems with the sewer network.Cllr Curran wants senior representatives from Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Departments for Infrastructure and Communities to meet with traders and insists that NI Water must also be represented.ldquoThe public realm scheme has been delayed by over three months, raw sewage has been running down the street and, most shockingly, traders have not been kept abreast of the reasons for the delay, he declared.ldquoThe Irish Street project was due to complete inside three months but it will now be early July and what those responsible for the work do not realise is that businesses are being affected across the town, not just those in Irish Street.Cllr Curran said the delay in completing the scheme is having a major impact on the town centre, revealing that he has heard reports that the number of people using the Irish Street car park has reduced since work on the public realm scheme started.He said with trading conditions dficult enough at the best of times, the last thing business owners need is for the one-way system remaining in place in Irish Street for another two months.ldquoThe delay in completing this scheme is nothing short of disgraceful and questions need answered. In addition, traders should be provided with weekly progress briefings as a matter of courtesy.

He claimed that taking twice as long to complete a scheme would not be accepted in areas like Newry, Lisburn or Belfast.He declared: ldquoMany businesses in Downpatrick are suffering as the result of an unacceptable delay. The clear evenings are now here, so why canrsquot contractors be asked to work longer to complete the scheme sooner ldquoWhile I accept that the delays may be the result of unexpected circumstances, surely the trick is to come up with imaginative solutions to get the work completed as soon as possible  The suggested completion date at the end of June needs to be reassessed now.Cllr Curran said he plans to contact the ious government departments and agencies to arrange a meeting with Irish Street traders and hopes it will take place as soon as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle park needs management strategy  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council officials have been asked to develop a management strategy for an open area at the rear of Newcastlersquos Donard Park and adjacent woodland.The request has been made by Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who recently tabled a council motion urging the local authority to contact the Annesley Estate with a view to leasing land it owns at this part of the town.Cllr Clarke is keen for this to happen to enable the council to maintain what he described as an ldquoattractive area to complement existing amenities in Donard Park.He believes the council can help play a key role in improving the recreational, health and well-being of local people, in tandem with enhancing the resortrsquos tourism potential,the area and its important habitat are managed properly.While his recent motion was referred to the local authorityrsquos Economic Regeneration and Tourism Committee for debate, Cllr Clarke said that,re-elected, one of his key priorities will be shaping the future management of a ldquo fabulous landscape and woodland, preserving it for future generations.He continued: ldquoThe upper green area needs to be incorporated in the future management of Donard Wood, while the pathways and signage for visitors need to be improved for visitors entering the main route used by hill walkers heading into the Mournes to climb Slieve Donard.ldquoIn the short term, I have made representations to council officials to carry out maintenance improvements at the Shanslieve Drive entrance to Donard Park where visitors are greeted by rusting litter bins, council signage dating back to the s and a potholed surface.Cllr Clarke said these are improvements that need to carried out immediately.Also this week, he has called on the local authority to repaint the historic archway at the entrance to Donard Park car park.He said: ldquoRepainting the archway will also improve the appearance and aesthetics of the entrance into Donard Park and I have requested that the work is undertaken as quickly as possible, Cllr Clarke added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle rock star’s intimate solo album  ","story":"THE discovery of a random white feather gave The Answerrsquos frontman Cormac Neeson a sign of hope at the most desperate time in his le mdash and the inspiration for his first solo album.The Newcastle rocker has just released a searingly intimate and personal album called White Feather with ten tracks which deal with his eldest son Dabhoacutegrsquos fight to be born and for le itself.Launching at Belfast venue The Black Box on May , the  year-old will give his most stripped back performance as an artist as he tours with the album over the coming months.His old friends, The Unholy Gospel Band, with bass guitarist, Downpatrickrsquos own Eamon Hanlon, will be joining him for the big night.Cormac also has a new single out from the album, Broken Wing, a country-inspired track with blues backing choir that will resonate with people whether they are a parent or not.His rock vocals have given way to a deeper, introspective sound that is still etched with emotion.The  year-old singer, who once toured with rock legends AD DC, says he the experience of nearly losing his son from being born prematurely at  weeks has changed him.Dabhoacuteg, who has Downrsquos Syndrome, weighed only lb oz when he was born. After spending his first four months in a hospital neo-natal unit and undergoing heart surgery on his first birthday, he is now four. Thankfully, Dabhoacuteg has turned the corner despite overcoming serious medical obstacles in his short le.Dabhoacuteg and his  month-old brother, Conall, mean everything to Cormac and his we Louise, who now live in Belfast.ldquoWhenever you have a sick child and you go through an ordeal like that with your family, it does definitely alter your perception and you come out the other side of it changed, said Cormac.ldquoYou just look at le in a dferent way. You appreciate stuff that you never appreciated because yoursquore not sitting in an intensive care unit in the Royal [Victoria Hospital]. Anything is better than that.The couple only had a few weeks to privately celebrate getting pregnant with their first child when Louise had to be rushed into hospital.They initially were advised that pregnancy was lost as it was so early but were told to come back to hospital in a few weeks time.ldquoIt was the longest two weeks in my le, recalls Cormac. ldquoThe night before we were due to go the hospital I went out for a walk in the Mournes. I was a bit raging at the world and screaming up to the heavens asking to be give a sign that everything was going to be ok.ldquoI was literally stopped dead in my tracks with this little splash of white high in a tree. I climbed up into the tree to see what it was and it was a white feather.ldquoI had always been brought up to believe that white feathers symbolised new le. I couldnrsquot believe that I spotted it at that time and brought it back down. I had a feeling then that everything was ok. The next day we went to hospital and sure enough there was this tiny mustard seed on the scan with the most giant heartbeat you ever saw in your le. It was the beginning of what was to be a most tumultuous journey and the beginning of where we are now, having an amazing four-year-old and a baby.ldquoDabhoacuteg really is a warrior. Hersquos been through more than me and most people ever will in their lives.Long-term fans of The Answer may be surprised at one of their leaders heading to Nashville to write and record the album.But as Cormac tells it, itrsquos just the way it was meant to be.He went to the home of country music in  on a songwriting course to help write songs for other artists but ended up literally pouring his heart and pain out in the songs mdash in time-honoured country music fashion.ldquoItrsquos not a country record but you can tell it is recorded in Nashville, said Cormac.ldquoThere is an awful lot of soul to it and a bit of subtley to it as well as it allowed me to express myself in the way that I needed to at this point in my le. I needed to make a record that reflected that switch in the way I see le.The Nashville approach to writing songs was a more reflective experience for Cormac that what he is used to with bandmates Paul Mahon, Mickey Waters and James Heatley.ldquoIt was just a completely dferent approach to songwriting that I had been used to doing for  years with The Answer, said Cormac. ldquoItrsquos a hard rocking blues band and a lot of our songs are written with the volume pedal turned up rfing away, having a good time and letting songs organically develop.ldquoIn Nashville, you sit in a room with two other people and an accustic guitar and you have a long conversation about your le and what you might want to write about. I found once we were locked into the message we wanted to put across in the song everything  fell into place. We basically wrote songs in the morning and recorded in the afternoon as thatrsquos what the studio expected.ldquoA lot of what Irsquom singing about on this record just would not work on a record from The Answer because it wouldnrsquot be appropriate. Rock and roll is loud and le-affirming. While a lot of these songs are le-affirming, they are in a completely dferent way.Cormac assures the bandrsquos devoted following that they have stockpiled a supply of new songs and will be coming out with a new album.Addressing his own personal hiatus, Cormac added: ldquoIrsquom still the same guy I was in The Answer and will be again when The Answer makes our next record. I just needed to get into the right room with the right writers making the right music.White Feather album will be released on April  before a tour kicks off in the UK on May  for a run of seven support shows followed by six Irish headline dates.

Sands struck with all the stealth and power that her dad Noel displayed for Down hurlers for many years as she beat Katie Smith all ends up with a clinical finish.Meath were now on the ropes and Sands delivered a second knock-out blow a minute later when she again ghosted in to direct a McCartan pass to the net and give down a - to - interval lead.Meath had the wind advantage after the break, but it was Down and the unrelenting McCartan who took centre stage.Two sensational points from the Castlewellan teenager, a daughter of former Down All-Ireland medal winner Greg in , stretched Downrsquos lead to seven points with only five minutes of the second half played.All credit to Meath, they steadfastly refused to throw in the towel and a Foley point left them trailing - to - after  minutes.It wax at this stage that Savage played a real captainrsquos role from her central half back role. She was simply imperious, plucking the sliotar out of the air and then sending it forward for her team-mates to chase.Meath went close to giving Down a fright in the rd minute when an explosive shot from Fagan rattled off the crossbar and was cleared to safety, but other than that, little got past Savage.McCartan and Leonard swapped points as the game drew to a close, but Down had no intention of relinquishing their grip on the game and refused to give Meath any more scores.Down: Niamh Sharkey, Orlaith OrsquoRourke, Hannah Toner, Alice Coulter, Isabella OrsquoHare, Blanaid Savage, Niamh Dempster, Megan OrsquoBoyle, Anna McKee, Cerys Clarke, Sorcha McCartan , Saoirse Sands , Gerra McGrattan, Aoibhinn Brentnall , Beth Fitzpatrick.

other than those with the style of royal highness and the title of prince or princess - when they needed a surname would use Mountbatten-Windsor, although the royal house remained the House of Windsor.Harry and Meghan have named their son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor.Royal author Penny Junor said: \"I would think the Duke of Edinburgh would be absolutely thrilled with that.\"She added: \"Archie is a lovely name, but the fact that theyve chosen to call him Mountbatten-Windsor.\"Prince Philip was never allowed to call his children by his own surname.\"I think thats a really nice tribute to Harrys grandfather.\"A delighted-looking Philip was pictured with his great-grandson, alongside the Queen, who was smiling broadly, and Harry and the duchesss proud mother Doria Ragland, as Meghan showed off their baby in her arms.The duke and duchess could have chosen for their son to use a courtesy title and become an earl instead.Royal visit to Worthing Samaritans celebrates th anniversary Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The surname Mountbatten-Windsor first appeared on an official document in , in the marriage register at Westminster Abbey for the wedding of Princess Anne to Captain Mark Phillips.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge used the surname during an invasion of privacy court case in France over photos taken of Kate while she was on holiday in .The Earl and Countess of Wessexs -year-old daughter is Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor, although it was announced when her name was revealed in  that she would be known as Lady Louise Windsor.Philip became a naturalised British subject ahead of his  wedding to Princess Elizabeth.He ditched his surname Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg - the family name of the Danish royal house from which his father was descended - for Mountbatten, an Anglicised version of Battenberg, his mothers family name.The royal familys name was radically switched to Windsor more than  years ago because of anti-German feeling during the First World War.King George V decided that it was inappropriate for the royals to hold the German name Saxe-Coburg-Gotha - which came to the family in  with the marriage of QueenVictoria to Prince Albert - while Britain was fighting Germany.On July  , the king issued a royal proclamation changing the royals house and surname, declaring that they would \"be styled and known as the House and Family of Windsor\".try catch  TrendingWoman and dog hit by car on NI roadN.I. local elections -

The absence of Stormont was a principal theme of the election, but not the issues which have caused its absence.Consequently, there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that signicant sections of the Unionist population have altered their stance on the substantive issues, including gay marriage, an Irish language act, and abortion.Furthermore, while there have been localised disappointments, the DUP’s vote has held up remarkably well for a party of government which has not sat for over two years.Indeed, the party’s share of first preference votes has increased to .% [up % on ] a staggering achievement under the circumstances.Perhaps the worst that can be said of the party’s performance is the need for a relook at its vote management strategy.As such, the DUP’s continuing strong performance should be read as an endorsement of the party’s pre-existing policies and should inform the DUP’s negotiating positions accordingly.Finally, the chipping away of Sinn Fein’s support to the likes of People Before Profit and Aontu suggest that not everyone within the republican electorate is pleased with Sinn Fein’s current strategy.The DUP should not be too quick to make concessions, while their opposition may be beginning to crack.In short, the results of the recent election have reinforced the DUP’s democratic mandate to maintain its current stance, and party policies, in the ongoing talks process.Academic: An Irish Language Act would be a long-term threat to the Union Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article

They are Roy Walker, former player with Luton Town, Ards, Glenavon, Portadown and Crusaders and former manager of Crusaders, Glenavon and Ballymena United and Stuart Elliott, capped  times for Northern Ireland and former player with Glentoran, Motherwell, Hull City, Doncaster Rovers, Hamilton Academical and Stirling Albion.The service will be conducted by Rev Robert Bell, from Ballyclare Presbyterian Church, who has enjoyed supporting the club throughout his years in the town, and been available to give them any encouragement and support he could. The congregation will be seated in the main stand at Dixon Park, while the service will be conducted from a dais on the pitch.The club extends a warm invitation to the whole community to join them for this very special event.Daniel O’Donnell sings the praises of Learning Disability Pride Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"LARN | Article

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reading of Markrsquos gospel was by David Cocks.At Nica the hymn lsquoHere is love, vast as the oceanrsquo was sung.The next reading was given by Ciara McAlpine. Finally at Tesco the hymn lsquoWhen I survey the wondrous crossrsquo was sung, with Sarah Long reading.Matt Lewis of Bethesda commissioned the new cross and led the short service at Bethesda.Many thanks go to Councillor John Fanshaw for the loan of the excellent PA system. Everyone was kept safe by the traffic marshal Brian West.The Friends of Belle Vue Park held an Easter celebration of their own.They said: ldquoWe had a fantastic time with crafts, games, seed planting and selfies.ldquoThere were so many amazing Easter hat designs, it was hard to choose!ldquoThanks to all the hard-working volunteers who made the event possibleAs well as events held by churches and chapels, Easter egg hunts were a recurring theme for many venues.Cosmeston Lakes hosted their own hunt over the course of the weekend, inviting people to try their luck at solving clues for prizes.Llantwit Major Surf Lesaving Club held an Easter egg hunt on Easter Monday, with face painting, name the bunny, refreshments and hot drinks.St Fagans National Museum of History held their own ldquoBig Museum Easter Trail, asking visitors to solve clues and follow the trail around the museum infor an ldquoegg-citing prize. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In a statement, they said: \"With millions of people signing online petitions there is a clear appetite for using digital technology to engage with politics.\"By fusing online engagement opportunities with MPs of all parties the group intends to become a signicant mass movement with , members and  MPs onboard by the end of .\"More United CEO Bess Mayhew said: ldquoPeople see cross-party working as a proxy for trust in politics.\"Thatrsquos why we are delighted Stephen Doughty MP has chosen to be a part of the More United network.\"Now we need to start tackling the important issues being ignored because of Brexit and give a voice to people who want to move Britain forward. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business GMcG is already a well-established and leading independent accountancy and advisory business, and the growing firm tells Ulster Business about planning for a brighter future, carrying out major investment and developing the next generation “Our success is about people, building and growing relationships, innovation and developing the next generation. We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

Either, they will need it when we leave, or they will need itwe stay,” Mr Thompson said.The status applies primarily to physical goods being transported across customs areas, including manufacturers, agri-business and general retail.Martin Dubbey, managing director of Safeguard AEO, said: “The big concern is not just the Northern Ireland border with the Republic. You also have  HGVs coming out every day down to the port, and then across.“I think there has to be some sort of fudge .”Meanwhile, Karen Wheeler, who heads the UK Border Delivery Group, has told a group of businesses here that there is no magic technological solution for preventing a hard border in Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gym_1.jpg","title":"new exercise business for city centre hotel","story":"Posted on Tuesday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest hotel will soon be punching well above its weight as a new exercise business sets up shop, Ulster Business can reveal.Fitness franchise Round has been growing in the UK at a steady pace, and will open its doors later this month at the Grand Central Hotel in Belfast city centre.Rather than running on a set schedule, a new Round session starts every three minutes, allowing a new workout every day, including a range of weight resistance, cardio and core-strength training.The company is one of the first brands in the UK to utilise wearable heart-rate technology, and class participants wear heart rate monitors, which are hooked up to a big screen in the gym.It’s understood Round Belfast will be opening in May .
