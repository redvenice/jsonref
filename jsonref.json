Hospitalisations and deaths are also on the rise. Some experts have said the subvariant may be behind the surge, which other European countries are not seeing to the same extent.Former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb tweeted on Sunday: \u0027We need urgent research to figure out if this \u0027delta plus\u0027 is more transmissible, has partial immune evasion.\u0027But Dr Jeffrey Barrett, director of the Covid Genomics Initiative at the Sanger Institute, told the Financial Times AY.4.2 alone does not explain the the UK\u0027s caseload, which is instead linked to the UK imposing less restrictions than other countries. Professor Balloux said its rapid spread \u0027could have caused a small number of additional cases\u0027, but added: \u0027It hasn\u0027t been driving the recent increase in case numbers in the UK.\u0027Official figures have shown cases are also being fuelled by youngsters returning to classrooms last month, with as many as one in 12 being infected.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said the Government is \u0027keeping a very close eye on\u0027 the subvariant. They said: \u0027There\u0027s no evidence to suggest that this variant … the AY.4.2 one … is more easily spread. There\u0027s no evidence for that but as you would expect we\u0027re monitoring it closely and won\u0027t hesitate to take action if necessary.\u0027Dr Alexander Edwards, an immunologist at the University of Reading, told MailOnline it would be concerning if a variant starts to dominant that evades vaccine immunity.He said: \u0027Before the successful rollout of vaccines, this was less likely to happen, but now, with such a high proportion of the population infected, alongside waning immunity, now is the time to be extra vigilant. \u0027Luckily, we can redesign our vaccines very quickly now, so there isn\u0027t yet anything to be afraid of. \u0027But any efforts made now to reduce cases and improve immunity - through boosters, vaccinating younger people, testing and effective isolating - could pay off if they cut the risk of vaccine evading variants.\u0027 Professor Lawrence Young, a virologist at the University of Warwick, told MailOnline the detection of AY.4.2 \u0027highlights the need for continued genomic surveillance of the virus\u0027. Experts will need to monitor it to determine \u0027if it really is more transmissible and if it has any impact of the efficacy of vaccination\u0027, he said.Professor Young added: \u0027The continued spread of the virus at a high level in the UK increases the risk of variants being generated that could be more infectiousness and more able to evade vaccine-induced immunity.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Government paper says ramping price high carbon foods help people eat sustainably","story":"Share this articleWhitehall considers meat tax to slash carbon emissions"},{"url":null,"title":"British Gas gets rapped advertising watchdog rules energy giant misled customers","story":"Share this article The regulator said: ‘The ads implied that all British Gas HomeCare customers would be able to call out engineers to attend urgent issues at short notice.’Around 3.4million HomeCare customers pay the energy giant hundreds of pounds a year to insure and service their boilers.But lockdown restrictions and an engineer strike resulted in a major backlog earlier this year."},{"url":null,"title":"armagh service attendees hope to switch focus to reconciliation","story":" Deputy first minister of Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness shakes hands with Queen Elizabeth as former       first minister Peter Robinson   looks on in Belfast in 2012.

It facilitated the event at which the handshake took place between the queen and former Sinn Féin politician and IRA member Martin McGuinness.“I think there’s a danger of this defining everything . . . we had the two state visits, the handshake with Martin McGuinness, all those were important, so we just have to redouble our efforts,” Mr Sheridan said.“We have to move on beyond this now, it’s one event that didn’t work out the way people had imagined, whatever the rights and wrongs of that.

File photograph: GettyIreland is being used to smuggle puppies into Britain and allowing criminal gangs to make millions of euro because of a “complete lack of enforcement” of animal welfare laws, the Seanad has heard.Sinn Féin Senator Lynn Boylan said pups were being moved across the Border into the North and then transported by criminal gangs to Britain, depriving the Revenue Commissioners of millions of euro in tax.She said better co-operation is needed between the authorities North and South but “there is a raft of animal welfare laws in this country and they are just not being enforced. That’s not good enough.”The issue was exposed in a BBC Northern Ireland Spotlight investigative report broadcast on Tuesday.“There are fake microchip numbers, fake dog-breeding licence numbers and fake seller numbers on websites,” Ms Boylan said.She said animal welfare organisations are reporting illegal advertisements on a daily basis but even though regulations have been in place since last year no enforcement cases have been taken against illegal online advertising.The Dublin Senator said that in June Dogs Trust appeared before the Oireachtas agriculture committee and its representatives outlined “how simple it would be to fix this”.They called for a national database that would include the microchip, dog-breeding licence number and online sales licence number. Any advert to sell dogs would have to be pre-verified before it could be posted online.Identifying the breedSenator Boylan added that a microchip system could be put in place “just like the system for cars. After a number is entered, the system would identify the breed and age of the dog and the name of the person it is registered This is not rocket science.”She added that because of an anomaly in the Animal Health and Welfare Act, puppies that are seized at Irish ports cannot be rehomed within five days as they could if they were seized under the Control of Dogs Act.The Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, one of the authorities involved in checks, has to hold on to the dogs for up to 18 months while legal proceedings take place. “That is bad for both the dog and the animal welfare organisation.”Ms Boylan called for the Minister for Agriculture to be asked to attend the Seanad for a debate “on animal welfare and lack of enforcement”."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"City with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 glasgow braced humiliation world stage shambolic preparation","story":"With more than 120 world leaders coming to Glasgow for the UN climate summit, it should have been a once in a generation chance to show off the very best of Britain to the watching world.Instead, Joe Biden, Emmanuel Macron and others will be greeted by rubbish-strewn streets, gridlocked roads, cancelled trains, glued-down protesters and a plague of rats after a city under SNP leadership became a “midden”.Refuse workers and train drivers have announced they will go on strike during the conference, prompting warnings of “world leaders stepping over bin bags” and a “humiliation on the world stage”.A chronic shortage of accommodation in Glasgow, which has led to a 3,000 per cent increase in the price of hotel rooms, has forced some delegations to book hotels 130 miles away. Two Eastern European cruise liners have also been brought to the Clyde as makeshift dormitories.It has prompted anger from the Government in Westminster, which believes Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u0027s First Minister, and Glasgow’s SNP-run council have risked the showpiece event turning into a national embarrassment.“It will be chaos if this continues,” said one senior UK government source.When Claire Perry, the former energy minister and then president of Cop26, announced two years ago that Glasgow would host the summit, she said it was the ideal venue because it is “one of the UK’s most sustainable cities with a great track record for hosting high-profile international events”.That reputation is now in shreds thanks to the nationalists running Holyrood and the city council.Earlier this year, the council ditched fortnightly bin collections in favour of one collection every three weeks - causing bins to overflow. At the same time, it introduced a £35 charge for disposing of large items, leading to an inevitable increase in fly-tipping. Thomas Kerr, the leader of the Conservative group on Glasgow council, said the city had become “the fly-tipping capital of Britain”.Critics were enraged when the council leader, the SNP’s Susan Aitken, brushed off the crisis by claiming the city merely needed a “spruce up”.Glasgow’s rat population has thrived on the uncollected food waste to become the fourth-biggest in the country. Three refuse collectors have even been injured by the rodents.Last week, refuse workers voted to go on strike during the conference, from Monday, November 1 to Monday, November 8, unless they are paid more money. The irony of a summit to clean up the planet being held in a city that cannot clean up its own streets will not be lost on those attending.Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, said the SNP had ensured that “Scotland is set to be humiliated on the world stage”, while Paul Sweeney, the Labour MSP for Glasgow, said: “It\u0027s going to be an absolute embarrassment when we will shortly have world leaders stepping over bin bags and rats bigger than cats.”A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said of the planned strike by refuse workers: Cop26 will undoubtedly be a busy and difficult time for the city and its residents. Holding this action only in Glasgow at this time will have disproportionate and unfair local impact in pursuit of a national campaign. We urge them to think again about the timing of this.The spokesman said fly-tipped waste was being removed within two days of being reported, and that Glasgow\u0027s rat population was entirely in keeping with the size of the city.Hours after the GMB announced strike action by refuse workers, the RMT union announced a strike by ScotRail staff from November 1 to November 12 - the entire duration of the conference.Graham Simpson MSP, Scotland’s Conservative shadow transport minister, said the strike action was “a major embarrassment for the SNP” and would mean world leaders and delegates arriving in a city where rail services will have “ground to a halt”.The likes of Joe Biden, of course, are unlikely to hop on the train to get to Cop26, but many of the 25,000 delegates would have done. Now they will be forced onto the roads to get from their hotels to the Scottish Event Campus (SEC), where the conference is being held. Even before the rail strikes were announced, Glasgow City Council helpfully published a map of where to expect road congestion during the summit, which showed the entire city centre coloured in red.A gridlocked motorway and road network will be like nectar to members of Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain and other climate change protesters.They will relish the chance to bring VIP traffic to a complete standstill by glueing themselves to roads, especially after Assistant Chief Constable Bernie Higgins, Police Scotland’s gold commander for the event, said officers on the ground “will facilitate unlawful protest, to a point” and would be “fair, friendly and accommodating”.His comments have caused such alarm that Police Scotland was forced to call a press briefing on Thursday at which they insisted protesters will not be allowed to disrupt the conference and that “protest removal teams” stand ready to remove anyone who blocks roads.If extremists needed any further encouragement, ministers in the Scottish Government have also issued an open invitation to them to disrupt the conference.Patrick Harvie, co-leader of the Scottish Greens and an environment minister in Holyrood’s coalition government, has said he supports the use of direct action by climate change protesters and urged them to find “creative” ways to protest.For the lucky few, conference events will be a short walk away from their hotels in the city. However for others, a shortage of accommodation has forced them to book rooms up to 130 miles away.One Whitehall source said: “Embassies and businesses have been getting in touch with the Government because they are unable to get hotel rooms. It’s a massive problem.“Some of them have resorted to staying in England and commuting to Glasgow because there’s just nowhere to stay in Glasgow. We have heard of people deciding to stay as far away as Newcastle.”There are still rooms available through Airbnb, but the so-called “Glasgow gold rush” has seen property owners asking mind-boggling sums. One apartment in the upmarket Kelvingrove area of the city has been advertised at £103,000 for 12 nights, while dozens of others are asking more than £20,000 for the duration of the conference.A few hotel rooms remain available, but only to those prepared to pay 30 times the normal going rate. One room which normally costs £42 was being advertised for £1,400 per night during the summit, while other budget hotels are charging more than £1,000 per night.The lack of beds has become so dire that two cruise ships are being berthed on the Clyde for people working at Cop26. The Latvian-flagged Romantika has already arrived in Renfrew. It will soon be followed by the Silja Europa, from Estonia, in what the vessels’ owner, Tallink, described as a last-minute agreement.In an act of desperation, the Scottish Government has now appealed to residents to open up their homes and allow conference-goers to sleep in their spare rooms. They have suggested that the Cop26 Homestay scheme will enable delegates from poorer countries to “attend the summit and make their voices heard”. However, local health chiefs are concerned it will simply turn Cop26 into a petri dish for Covid.Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said: People coming from different parts of the world, some where the vaccination programme is not the same as ours, there are risks associated with that.Then you put people in touch with one another, in folk\u0027s homes, and that increases the risk even more.Downing Street fears that the multiple failings will not be enough to dampen Nicola Sturgeon’s desire to hijack the event for her own means. Leaked notes and WhatsApp messages have shown that Number 10 and the Cabinet Office are concerned she will use the event as a “soapbox for her independence obsession”.

If you didn’t notice, Parliament has quietly extended the Government’s emergency Covid powers for another six months.   We know where this will lead. The Prime Minister will fend off the Fergusons for a while – all the more so this time around because he won’t want to spoil his big party in Glasgow (although what is allowed to happen there will depend on Nicola Sturgeon). But eventually he will capitulate, and will appear in his Downing Street briefing room telling us that there is no option other than to send us all back to our hidey holes and await the all-clear, quite possibly some time next spring.There is no visible strategy behind any of this. We have become prisoners of the daily Covid numbers. When they rise, ministers start panicking. When they rise fast enough to present as a straight upwards line on one of Chris Whitty’s graphs, they panic a little more. When Ferguson or one of Sage’s modelling teams present a graph projecting that deaths have a theoretical chance of exceeding some previous peak, the game is up – we’re in lockdown.   Meanwhile, the Government has started to drift on its one genuine achievement: the vaccination programme. Having once led the world, we have stalled with 66.5 per cent of the population fully-vaccinated – well behind former laggards like Italy (70.2 per cent) and Spain (79.3 per cent). Ministers prevaricated over whether or not booster shots would be needed, with the result they started late. Only 27.8 per cent of care home residents and 14.1 per cent of staff have received a third booster jab. The Government, too, last month cancelled an order for 100 million doses of the French-developed Valneva vaccine, which, according to trial results published this week, seems to be more effective than the AstraZeneca jab. Before we start to disappear down the rabbit hole once more, one small reform I would like is this: for the Government to stop simply publishing raw figures of new Covid infections, hospitalisations with Covid and deaths. Instead it should publish statistics on mortality from all causes, broken down by age – so we can see Covid cases in their proper context. If the Government published similar figures for pneumonia and influenza and we started agonising over them, we would never fully open society, certainly not in winter. Secondly, wouldn’t it be helpful if the Government broke down its Covid figures to show how many of those deaths and hospitalisations were among vaccinated people and how many among unvaccinated people?  Publishing such figures might even be just the incentive the Government needs to persuade the rest of the population to be vaccinated. Never mind vaccination passports, just give us the facts – how many of the seriously-ill are vaccinated and how many are not – and leave us to make up our own minds. It might well turn out to be the difference between freedom and lockdown. More from NewsDonald Trump to launch new social network \u0026#39TRUTH Social\u0026#39Britain in talks to sell arms to Ukraine for first timeUK and New Zealand agree new trade deal – and Sauvignon Blanc could get cheaperOur deal with New Zealand is a win-win for both countriesRoad tax is ‘inevitable’ to fill black hole left by motoring taxesSuspected terrorist killer of Sir David Amess may have targeted two other MPsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"deal new zealand win win countries","story":"This week is proving to be the biggest yet in realising our vision for Global Britain. On Tuesday, we hosted the Global Investment Summit, which saw the world’s leading investors commit nearly £10 billion to the industries of the future across the UK. Today, we are proud to announce we have secured a free trade agreement in principle with one of our oldest and closest allies: New Zealand.Our like-minded democracies could not be closer through our shared history and values. We are united in our fundamental belief that the best way to boost jobs and growth lies firmly in free trade, underpinned by high standards and the rule of law. This agreement shows what Britain can achieve through an independent trade policy, by slashing red tape for small businesses, securing zero-tariff access to New Zealand for all British goods and opening up their market to our world-class tech and services companies.This deal gives British businesses the competitive edge in New Zealand’s fast-growing market. It cuts tariffs on our goods exports such as ships, buses and bulldozers, which means firms can do business at lower cost in an import market which is set to grow by 30 per cent over this decade. In turn, we are making it easier for British consumers to enjoy more of the best New Zealand has to offer, from Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc to Manuka honey and kiwi fruit.This agreement is a win-win, and it plays to our strengths as the second-largest services exporter in the world. It will be easier for UK lawyers, architects and other professionals to work in New Zealand, allowing UK companies to set up there and take British talent with them.As we look forward to hosting New Zealand alongside other partners for the COP26 climate change summit, it is fitting that our new trade deal is one of our greenest ever. A far-reaching environment chapter will encourage trade and investment in low carbon goods, services and technology, with the most comprehensive list of environmental goods with liberalised tariffs in any trade deal.The agreement shows the UK’s readiness to lead the charge globally on clean innovation and sustainable growth and We already leading by example, with tariffs cut on over a hundred green goods from around the world as part of our Global Tariff regime. Investors can see we are a global hub for green trade, with EY estimating that London is the top city in Europe for investment-backed “cleantech” projects.it caps a fantastic week of good green news. Besides the success of Tuesday’s Global Investment Summit, £5.8 billion of foreign investment in green projects has been secured since the launch of the PM’s Ten Point Plan, along with at least 56,000 jobs in the UK’s clean industries.Digital trade is becoming ever more important, which is why we have agreed world-leading provisions that will cut red tape for our advanced tech and services companies and make it easier for smaller businesses to break into the New Zealand market.This deal also marks a major step in our accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). This high-standards pact includes eleven dynamic economies, worth more than £8 trillion in global GDP as of last year.Joining CPTPP will mean we can export more than ever to a collective marketplace of over half a billion people who crave high-quality goods and services. That will drive forward an exports-led recovery across every region and nation of the UK, levelling up our country with high-quality jobs.Our deal with New Zealand will help us seize new opportunities abroad while boosting jobs, enterprise and prosperity at home. Together, we will come out of the pandemic stronger as we build back better and greener through trade.Anne-Marie Trevelyan is Secretary of State for International TradeMore from NewsDonald Trump to launch new social network \u0026#39TRUTH Social\u0026#39Britain in talks to sell arms to Ukraine for first timeUK and New Zealand agree new trade deal – and Sauvignon Blanc could get cheaperRoad tax is ‘inevitable’ to fill black hole left by motoring taxesSuspected terrorist killer of Sir David Amess may have targeted two other MPsGet booster jab now to avoid return of Christmas restrictions, warns Sajid JavidMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"limit sleep 75 hours night delay alzheimers onset says study","story":"People should get no more than seven and a half hours of sleep a night in order to delay the onset and worsening of Alzheimer\u0027s disease, according to new research.Getting too much sleep – including the often recommended eight hours – was found to increase the likelihood of worsening brain function, a classic symptom of the disease.Our study suggests that there is a middle range, or \u0027sweet spot\u0027, for total sleep time where cognitive performance was stable over time, said Dr Brendan Lucey, of the Sleep Medicine Centre at Washington University and the first author of the research.In the paper, published in the journal Brain, the researchers wrote: These results support the suggestion that sleep measures have an optimal middle range... and suggest targets for sleep interventions to help maintain cognitive function in iniduals at risk of developing Alzheimer\u0027s disease.Alzheimer\u0027s was the biggest killer in the UK every year between 2016 and 2019, and in 2020 only Covid accounted for more deaths. Sleep, cognitive decline and Alzheimer\u0027s have long been known to be linked, but determining the relationship has been difficult.Previous evidence has found that cognitive decline, which manifests itself as memory loss, confusion and taking longer to learn new things, is linked to poor sleep. It is also known to be a symptom of Alzheimer\u0027s, and the disease is thought to be the main cause of cognitive decline in adults.Dr Lucey recruited 100 elderly people and monitored their sleep for one week a year over several years, using EEG caps that record brain waves and activity.Tests and questionnaires were used to gauge cognitive performance and alertness, while researchers also took blood samples and vials of cerebrospinal fluid to see whether the participants had high levels of Alzheimer\u0027s-linked proteins in their system.Most people in the study – 88 – had no cognitive impairments, 11 were very mildly impaired and one had mild cognitive impairment, the researchers said. Cognitive performance was worse in people who had too much or too little sleep. Those in the middle range of between five and a half and seven and a half hours showed no signs of worsening cognitive function.Short and long sleep times were associated with worse cognitive performance, perhaps due to insufficient sleep or poor sleep quality, said Dr Lucey.An unanswered question is if we can intervene to improve sleep, such as increasing sleep time for short sleepers by an hour or so, would that have a positive effect on their cognitive performance so they no longer decline? We need more longitudinal data to answer this question.Dr David Holtzman, a professor of neurology and co-senior author of the report, said it was particularly interesting to see that not only those with short amounts of sleep but also those with long amounts of sleep had more cognitive decline, adding: It suggests that sleep quality may be key, as opposed to simply total sleep.More from NewsDonald Trump to launch new social network \u0026#39TRUTH Social\u0026#39Britain in talks to sell arms to Ukraine for first timeUK and New Zealand agree new trade deal – and Sauvignon Blanc could get cheaperOur deal with New Zealand is a win-win for both countriesRoad tax is ‘inevitable’ to fill black hole left by motoring taxesSuspected terrorist killer of Sir David Amess may have targeted two other MPsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"need referendum net zero save britain green blob","story":"Does the blob never learn? Voters don’t like being treated like naughty children, let alone apathetic imbeciles, by technocrats convinced that they know best. Much of the electorate is now in a permanently defiant, irritable mood. It has grown allergic to stitch-ups by the ruling class across Westminster, the City, the arts and academia, and is repelled by attempts to impose a single political vision as a fait accompli, with no debate and no consultation. This applies as much to radical environmentalism and net zero, the groupthink du jour, as it does to Brexit, the NHS, overseas wars, crime or immigration.The universal franchise was hard-won. The electorate is deeply attached to its democratic rights, not just when it comes to form – elections being held, and results respected – but also in terms of ethos. It expects the great questions of the day to be carefully discussed, and for voters to have the ultimate choice between meaningfully different options. Decisions cannot be delegated to a self-anointed, conformist oligarchy.Voters hate it when, as with the EU, they were told by Labour, Tories and Lib Dems alike that ever-closer union was the best of all possible worlds, that the only acceptable debate was about the speed of integration, and that only a racist would disagree. Ordinary folks’ revenge, when it came, was devastating.It beggars belief, therefore, that a government of Brexiteers, in power only because they led a populist rebellion against another cross-party consensus, have forgotten this crucial lesson when it comes to net zero, and are seeking to enshrine a revolution without consulting the public. Yes, the vast majority, at least in wealthy nations, wants to improve the environment, reduce pollution, bolster bioersity, treat animals better and prevent man-made catastrophes.But that is where the near-universal consensus ends: the details of how to proceed are explosively contentious, and require democratic assent to be legitimate. The parallel with Brexit is clear: the fact that voters all agreed that another European war must be avoided didn’t mean they all wanted to fuse their countries into a superstate.The Government has learnt the wrong lessons from Covid – in a genuine health or military emergency, the electorate temporarily gives its support to any government it believes is doing its best. Even in such cases, a minority will favour alternative solutions, such as a Swedish approach.Decarbonisation is entirely different to the pandemic, whether or not you judge that we face a climate emergency. The public won’t automatically rally around whatever the government proposes. Many, perhaps most, will hate much of it. Net zero involves long-term, hugely significant measures that could drastically modify lifestyles and give the state immense, permanent powers to socially engineer as it sees fit.Do you agree that all new petrol and diesel cars should be banned in just nine years’ time? Or that gas boilers should be replaced, at great cost, with heat pumps, a technology that doesn’t quite work yet? Are you willing to eat less meat and pay higher taxes? Do you disagree entirely, or accept some of these ideas but not others? Or would you prefer to take it more slowly given China’s reluctance to act?The shocking reality is that how you answer is irrelevant. The public isn’t being given a choice. The fact of, and speed, scale and method of decarbonisation have been decided: Tories, Labour and Lib Dems all agree on all the essentials. It doesn’t matter who wins the next election: a new orthodoxy rules supreme. There is no functioning democracy, no mechanism by which outcomes might change. This is a disgrace and extremely dangerous.One doesn’t have to disagree with everything the Government is planning to be concerned. I really like electric cars, though I can’t see how banning combustion engines so quickly in the absence of better, long-range batteries can work. Why not let capitalism continue to organically shift consumers over? It is great that Boris rejects the hair-shirt, neo-communist approach to greening Britain, and that he backs nuclear and hydrogen. But do I really trust a government that has waged war on the car, invented so-called low-traffic neighbourhoods and campaigned against Heathrow expansion not to revert to banning everything vaguely carbon-positive if it falls behind on its targets?Why is its nudge unit advocating a tax on meat and producers and retailers of “high-carbon” food? The inflammatory document, disowned by the Government but commissioned by the Department for Business, demonises business travel and seeks to reduce international tourism and restrict airport expansion – goodbye, capitalist freedom. Can the Government guarantee that it would never impose extreme restrictions, rationing on homes and business or even mini eco-lockdowns? Or use a punitive form of road pricing to drastically reduce mobility (as opposed to ensuring motorists pay appropriately for road usage)? Will the courts start striking down high-carbon housebuilding or farming?Net zero isn’t a technical issue: it is an inherently political question, one of the greatest choices we have ever been asked to make. In the sickening absence of disagreement between the parties, a massive, uncontrollable backlash is guaranteed, at least when the bills start to drop. The only question is who the new green-sceptic Nigel Farage will be, and the next Boris figure? What will Vote Leave II look like?Johnson should preempt this war, which could destroy the Tories, and call a referendum on net zero today. His obligation, in doing so, would be to explain in exhaustive, costed detail how he proposes to achieve the changes he so fervently believes in. The No side would present its case, holding Johnson to account, proposing alternatives, with the public taken through the pros and cons and trade-offs. The results should be legally binding, with MPs compelled to implement the verdict, and the question tightly defined. The Government will have its work cut out: the Swiss have just rejected plans to slash their own emissions and to slap higher taxes on fossil fuels.The green challenge is too important, its implications too dramatic, to be left to an establishment that has embraced net zero as if it were a new religion. The public must have the final say, and the only way this will happen is through another referendum.More from NewsDonald Trump to launch new social network \u0026#39TRUTH Social\u0026#39Britain in talks to sell arms to Ukraine for first timeUK and New Zealand agree new trade deal – and Sauvignon Blanc could get cheaperOur deal with New Zealand is a win-win for both countriesRoad tax is ‘inevitable’ to fill black hole left by motoring taxesSuspected terrorist killer of Sir David Amess may have targeted two other MPsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"no case ending online anonymity","story":"The brutal killing of Sir David Amess MP at a constituency surgery was a tragic and senseless event. Coming five years after the assassination of my friend Jo Cox, it has sent horribly familiar shockwaves through our political establishment. And understandably, in the days since, the reflections on Sir David’s life of service from MPs, ministers, commentators, his constituents and loved ones have been accompanied by a discussion on how we can prevent another terrible tragedy in the future.As a former MP, I am saddened and shaken by Sir David’s death, and I understand the fear all MPs feel in the wake of these events. And as a prominent Jewish woman, I am all too familiar with the hateful abuse that is common on social media from the trolls and disguised accounts who feel no remorse or shame in spreading hate on the internet. But as chief executive of Index on Censorship – an organisation founded to protect the right to freedom of expression – I am troubled by the speed with which online anonymity has become the dominant topic in discussions about what our response to this tragedy should be.It is clear more action needs to be taken to protect our legislators. But thus far, there is no evidence to suggest that there was any link between Sir David’s death and online anonymity. It is a sad fact that the abuse we see on social media often comes from named accounts – unfortunately, mine tends to. Some 99 cent of the Twitter accounts suspended for racism during the Euro 2020 championships, for example, were not anonymous. Many of those people who use social media to abuse are proud to do it from a named profile.Even where abuse is posted anonymously, there are already models to deal with it. Most “anonymous” content is not truly anonymous, but provisionally so. In almost all cases, if there is a need to identify an inidual, this can be achieved with the details held by platforms and internet service providers. A number of policy and legal options already exist to tackle criminal uses of online anonymity, and the police can and do work with online platforms which are used to send abusive messages. Given that these powers already exist, the real question is why more is not being done to tackle online hate, and how can we change the toxic culture not just the law.Ending online anonymity isn’t just a fruitless gesture – it would actively destroy what is so valuable about the internet for so many. The ability to be anonymous online is often vital for safety. This is not just true for whistleblowers and dissidents, but also in much more common experiences. Anonymity on the internet gives young people questioning their sexuality or gender the space to connect with other members of the LGBQT+ community without forcing them to come out. It allows victims of domestic abuse to share their experiences and access resources without having to speak publicly about their trauma. It allows millions to seek help everyday with issues that they don’t feel comfortable sharing with friends and family offline.Ending anonymity would also exclude millions of Britain’s most marginalised people from the internet. Demands for identity verification tend to propose linking online access to formal documentation, such as a passport or driving licence. At least \u20283.5 million people in the UK do not own any form of photo ID, according to Electoral Commission figures. This would lead to already socially excluded people being shut off from vital services.It is understandable that, in the wake of such a horrifying tragedy, our instinct is to grasp wildly for an instantaneous tool or trick that will mean we can say “never again”. And, given the torrent of threats and abuse to which many MPs and their staff are subject on a daily basis on social media, it is all too easy to conflate two separate issues, and look for a catch-all solution.Sadly, it’s just not that simple. These issues throw up massive and difficult questions about how we balance freedom of expression against online safety, and how we protect our politicians from abuse and violence while allowing them to be accessible to their constituents. These questions require thoughtful consideration, and I can’t pretend I have all the right answers – but I do know that ending anonymity online is the wrong one.Ruth Smeeth is chief executive of Index on CensorshipMore from NewsDonald Trump to launch new social network \u0026#39TRUTH Social\u0026#39Britain in talks to sell arms to Ukraine for first timeUK and New Zealand agree new trade deal – and Sauvignon Blanc could get cheaperOur deal with New Zealand is a win-win for both countriesRoad tax is ‘inevitable’ to fill black hole left by motoring taxesSuspected terrorist killer of Sir David Amess may have targeted two other MPsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"president macron should look closer home origins wokeism","story":"Of all people, one might have expected Jean-Michel Blanquer, the French education minister, to know that the philosophical underpinnings of wokeism, far from being Anglo-Saxon – are in fact French. The term woke now extends way beyond the initial rally for 1930s Americans to be conscious of racism. It is a pot pourri of causes given intellectual legitimacy by the writings and methodology of a gaggle of French intellectuals working in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze and Simone de Beauvoir must be turning in their graves at the idea that their philosophies – based on deconstruction, social control, gender roles and sexuality, otherness, critical psycho-analysis and the patriarchy’s repression of the second sex – can be credited to the Anglosphere. That is why Mr Blanquer’s new think tank to combat wokeism in French education, the “Laboratory of the Republic”, needs to go back to basics: wokeism\u0027s intellectual roots are cultural theory, post-structuralism, critical theory, and feminist theory – ideas that emerged from Paris’s Left Bank, and which were subsequently borrowed and weaponised on American campuses to give intellectual heft to American radicalism, notably on race, feminism and gender, and which France is in the process of re-importing.  Ironically, a perverted 1960s Parisian Left-wing intellectual freedom is coming back to haunt the City of Light with the darkness and denial inherent in cancel culture, statue-toppling and a new moral puritanism. Mr Blanquer’s fear is that this imported wokeism will undermine the French Republican ideal and threaten national cohesion.  Of course the real instigator of the anti-woke project is Emmanuel Macron, who has denounced social-science theories imported from America. His so-far unconfirmed candidacy for the French presidential election in six months requires him to counter the meteoric rise of the far-Right hopeful Éric Zemmour, whose principal target is wokeism and its pollution of French culture, values and way of life. Indeed, Macron is killing two birds with one stone, as his crusade against the Anglo-Saxons has shifted to a higher gear since Australia, America and Britain deprived France of the submarine sale of the century and shut France out of the Indo-Pacific Aukus Pact. But in attributing wokeism to the Anglo-Saxons, the usually historically attuned Macron is merely justifying why for all his cleverness in getting into the elite nursery of French civil servants – the Ecole Nationale d\u0027Administration – he failed twice to get into the ultra-elitist school of the French intelligentsia, the Ecole Normale Supérieure, which happens to have produced many of the leading philosophers at the core of woke ideology.Paradoxically, Macron and his education minister would do well to point their new think tank towards an Anglo-Saxon intellectual and philosopher who warned for years about the malevolent direction in which many of these French philosophers were taking Western thought. As early as the 1980s, in a book now entitled Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left, the late Sir Roger Scruton included Lacan as the only outright fool in his book, but classified other Left Bankers, like postructuralists Deleuze and Althusser, as cogs in the nonsense machine. He chillingly diagnosed these philosophies as having contributed to reducing the landscape of the modern humanities to the intellectual equivalent of the aftermath of the Somme.The Anglo-Saxons, as General de Gaulle, ergo Emmanuel Macron, refers to them, have been the object of the French leader’s discontent since Brexit, Trump and now Aukus. But to brand the intellectual origins of wokeism as American is to undermine the French intellectual stature he craves.John Keiger is a former Professor of International History and Research Director in the Department of Politics and International Studies, University of Cambridge More from NewsDonald Trump to launch new social network \u0026#39TRUTH Social\u0026#39Britain in talks to sell arms to Ukraine for first timeUK and New Zealand agree new trade deal – and Sauvignon Blanc could get cheaperOur deal with New Zealand is a win-win for both countriesRoad tax is ‘inevitable’ to fill black hole left by motoring taxesSuspected terrorist killer of Sir David Amess may have targeted two other MPsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/N0O0lX8z/poster.jpg","title":"uk covid infection rate europe","story":"Article bookmarkedFind your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profileDon\u0026#x27t show me this message again✕✕CloseRelated video: UK Covid-19 cases surge, hospitals strained Cases of Covid-19 in the UK are currently among the highest in Europe and are higher than they were this time last year, when parts of England were under local lockdowns.The vaccine has meant that although case numbers are elevated, there are fewer cases of people with serious illness having to be treated in hospital.

Hospital admission numbers are still below levels seen last autumn, although they are rising gradually.According to Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) from Imperial College London, there are “a number of reasons” why the UK currently has higher infection levels than many other European countries.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the professor suggested that the UK has “lower functional immunity in our population than most other western European countries” for a number of reasons.According to Professor Ferguson these reasons include the vaccine rollout starting earlier in the UK than elsewhere and the fact that “we relied more on the AstraZeneca vaccine”.There are other suggestions that less mask wearing, more relaxed rules around mixing and a slowing vaccine rollout could also be behind the surge in figures. But why exactly are cases of Covid rising in the UK?Waning immunity?The UK was one of the fastest countries in the world to rollout the Covid-19 vaccine, meaning that immunity of some of those who were first vaccinated may be lower now.A study of Covid test results of vaccinated people who logged their symptoms in an app, suggested that after about five or six months, the protection against catching the virus wanes significantly.Join our new commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesView  comments"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus plan c household mixing","story":"Coronavirus Plan C with household mixing ban being considered by ministersHealth Secretary Sajid Javid ruled out the implementation of Plan B restrictions despite soaring Covid cases, but it is said ministers are discussing more drastic measuresRules on households mixing were first relaxed in May Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByWilliam WalkerNews Reporter:,  Oct | commentsThe ban on households mixing could reportedly make awith Brits urged to take Covid tests before Christmas gatherings with family and friends.

The -page document had suggested “a producer-facing carbon tax” could be slapped on beef and lamb. And it proposed the government “normalise” plant-based food by offering more of it in hospital, school, prison, court, civil service and military canteens. Officials would have been encouraged to “target those learning to shop and cook for the first time, such as students.” And it could have seen a behavioural campaign to portray eating less meat as a “desirable social norm”. The document was uploaded to the government’s website yesterday as part of a Net Zero strategy and badged with the logo of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. But there was one problem - the government had already rejected the advice and it was never adopted as government policy.

For that reason, our Net Zero Strategy published yesterday contained no such plans.” The document, titled Net Zero: Principles for successful behaviour change initiatives, was drawn up by the Behavioural Insights Team. Formerly the Behavioural Insights Unit, the team is now run outside government. It said plant-based foods could become “the default choice in school or government public canteens and events.” “Timely moments for diet sht will include targeting those learning to shop and cook for the first time, such as students,” it added. And it suggested policy could “normalise plant-based food by integrating it through menus and shops rather than in ‘special’ aisles”.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

It went on: “Asking people directly to eat less meat and dairy is a major political challenge, though positive framings and smaller asks may be possible . “Evidence suggest highlighting health co-benefits can be more appealing than purely environmental messages . “Effort to win ‘hearts and minds’ may be better spent building public support for bold policy, such as a producer-facing carbon tax on ruminant products. “It will be important to maintain a narrative of genuine fairness to maintain public support. For example, an unsophisticated meat tax would be highly regressive. Moreover, narratives must avoid alienation of mainstream dietary choices, or demonisation of the livestock sector, which will ultimately be the solution rather than the problem.” Boris Johnson unveiled more details of the UK’s plan to reach Net Zero carbon emissions by .

The -page blueprint lays out the Governmentaposs plans to meet legal targets to cut emissions to net zero by  in a bid to tackle dangerous climate change. Climate advisers do not think peopleaposs lives will be that dferent under the plans. Brits will still be flying, eating meat, warming their homes and going to work in the coming decades. But some big changes will be required to day-to-day le to get the UK on track to hit the targets. As the Government scrambles to prepare for COP climate summit in Glasgow, we look at how the sht to net zero will impact on your le. Homes One of the main things that will change is how we heat our homes, moving away from gas and other fossil fuels for heating and hot water, and cooking. For many people that will mean a switch from a boiler to a heat pump, installed in inidual houses and powered by electricity, working a bit like a fridge in reverse to generate heat from the outside air, or sometimes the ground. In cities, district heat networks, which pipe hot water underground to bring heat to homes from a central source, such as the energy from a waste plant, rivers, or even former mines, to heat exchangers instead of boilers in inidual homes could be the answer. And in some places, where hydrogen is being manufactured as a clean alternative to fossil fuels for industry, HGVs and other uses, it could be put through the gas pipe network to heat nearby homes with compatible new boilers. All heating technologies are more efficient at heating a home - and reducing energy demand and bills -homes are well insulated. So campaigners have called for a major energy efficiency programme to make houses much cosier than today, with double or triple glazing, draught proofing and high levels of loft and wall insulation.  Travel Transport is currently the biggest single source of emissions, so those will have to be tackled, and a key way to do that is switching from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles. By the s, new cars will all be electric, andyou have off-street parking, you will be able to charge your car on your front drive rather than having to refuel at a petrol station. But while the range - the number of miles a car can do on a single charge - is increasing, the infrastructure to allow people to charge up on long journeys or on the street will need to improve. And itaposs not just about switching the type of vehicle you drive. Part of the picture will be cutting the number of journeys taken by car and increasing the number of people in a vehicle, as well as ensuring more walking and cycling and better provision for both. That will make towns and cities less polluted and more liveable, while people could be healthier because they are getting more exercise.  Projections by the independent advisory Climate Change Committee do not include a cut in flying, but instead a reduction in the growth in demand for flights, and the Government is pushing development of more sustainable fuels. But the Climate Assembly - a group of more than  citizens from around the country convened by Parliament to discuss how we cut our emissions to zero - did support some kind of frequent flyer levy to charge the small proportion of people who take lots of flights. The changes in working, such as more video conferencing, brought on by the pandemic, could be here to stay, cutting business travel and commuting. Diets The Climate Change Committee says we should be eating a fth less meat by . As well as cutting emissions from livestock, the move will free up land to grow energy crops or create forests that soak up excess carbon emissions and provide habitat for wildle which is also in crisis. The Government has said it will not tell people what to eat as part of its efforts to reach net zero, working with the grain of consumer choice, although it does see a slight reduction in line with current trends. The committee says its recommendations for curbing meat consumption are well within the Governmentaposs own guidelines for healthy eating.  Jobs This is another key area where things are going to change for some people, as jobs in high-carbon industries go and green jobs are created instead. This could include jobs in sectors such as manufacturing electric cars, and zero-carbon steel, boiler fitters retraining as heat pump engineers, or workers in the offshore oil and gas industry taking new jobs in the offshore wind sector. But that means there must be support, retraining and re-skilling for workers in high-carbon sectors so they are not left behind in the move to a green economy. Costs How much all of this will cost for iniduals and families is a big question, with the Treasury warning that the costs - and the benefits - will not fall equally among households, and policies will be needed to reduce the costs and spread the burden fairly. Some new technologies are signicantly more expensive, such as heat pumps, prompting the Government to bring in grants to reduce the costs, but the hope is prices will fall as markets scale up.

His comments came just hours after ministers gathered in the Commons for PMQsSajid Javid said people should wear face masks in enclosed spaces Image: Getty ImagesByChiara Fiorillo:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsSajid Javid has said the public should wear a face mask to think about others around them in some enclosed settings just hours after Tory MPs packed into the House of Commons without them. The Health Secretary, who did not wear a face mask in the Commons today, urged people to consider wearing a mask in busy places such as public transport but did not make them compulsory again. At tonightaposs press conference, he said: There are many things we can all do, like wearing face coverings in crowded or close spaces.His comments came just hours after ministers gathered in the Commons for Prime Ministeraposs Questionsand most Tory MPs did not wear a face mask when sitting next to others. Mr Javid came under fire over his colleaguesapos behaviour - and one Tory MPaposs plans to hold a Christmas party - during todayaposs Downing Street press conference.  He responded to a question about their actions contradicting official advice by saying aposI think thataposs a very fair pointapos. Weaposve all got a role to play and set an example to set as private iniduals as well. Itaposs a very fair point and Iaposm sure a lot of people have heard you, he added. Mr Javid added that the Government is not currently planning to implement its Plan B for tackling coronavirus, adding that ministers do not believe the pressures on the NHS are unsustainable at the moment. Responding to questions, he said: “You said, am I sayingwe don’t do our bit, get vaccinated, all those behavioural changes we can make, that we are more likely to face restrictions as we head into winter - then I am saying that. “I think we’ve been really clear that we’ve all got a role to play. “If not enough people get their booster jabs,not enough of those people who were eligible for the original offer - the million that remain unvaccinated -they don’t come forward. “If people don’t wear masks when they really should in a really crowded place with lots of people they don’t normally hang out with. “If they’re not washing their hands and stuff - it’s going to hit us all. and it would of course make it more likely we’re going to have more restrictions.“Now we want to avoid those, we’ve set out what those restrictions might look like, we’ve set out the Plan B restrictions for example, and we all want to avoid those.”In his first-ever Downing Street press conference, Sajid Javid repeated his warning that Covid- cases could reach , a day as the country enters a challenging winter period.He said the UK was seeing greater pressure on the NHS but said the Government will do what it takes to make sure that this pressure doesnapost become unsustainable and that we donapost allow the NHS to become overwhelmed. He said deaths remain mercully low at the moment, even though in the past week almost a thousand people died after contracting the disease. He added: Weaposve always known that the winter months would pose the greatest threat to our road to recovery.  He added: Thanks to the vaccination programme, the link between hospitalisations and deaths has signicantly weakened, but itaposs not broken. So we must all remember that this virus will be with us for the long term and remains a threat to our loved ones, and a threat to the progress that weaposve made in getting our nation closer to normal le. The latest Government figures show that a further  people have died within  days of testing positive for Covid- as of Wednesday. As of am on Wednesday, there have been a further , lab-confirmed Covid- cases in the UK. Hospital admissions stand at  on average per day over the last seven days, up from  a week earlier, a rise of  per cent.  Earlier, Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation which represents health bodies, warned that we risk stumbling into a winter crisis unless measures such as face masks and vaccine passports - the Governmentaposs Plan B for the coming months - are introduced in England. He called for ministers to come up with a Plan C of even tougher restrictionsthose measures are insufficient to address pressure on the health service. A behavioural expert has predicted thatthe Government made face masks compulsory again, most people in England would follow the rule.  Professor Linda Bauld said the nation is the outlier in the UK when it comes to coronavirus safety measures, as many aspects included in the Westminster Governmentaposs Plan B are already in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The behavioural scientist, who is Professor of Public Health at the University of Edinburgh, said the main issue is communication and added that making something mandatory is a big sht which sends a message that people need to comply. Under the Governmentaposs current Plan A strategy, people in England are advised to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed settings but it is not a legal requirement. Prof Bauld said it is striking and very unfortunate that most Conservative MPs sit in the House of Commons without masks, compared with those on the opposition benches who have generally been seen to wear face coverings. She said: Leaders need to lead by example and with thesenumbers and the concerns we have, absolutely, I think politicians from all parties should be wearing a face covering when theyaposre in the chamber, when they canapost distance etc. Itaposs social norms that drive these behaviours. When you mandate something, itaposs a big sht, it sends a message that itaposs expected and therefore you need to comply unless thereaposs an exception. She added: I think there are some people who feel quite comfortable still wearing one and donapost care what anybody  thinks, but there are others who do , and so, therefore, I think just saying we recommend it but itaposs not required isnapost strong enough. It just doesnapost really work.

The move could mean the p charge on plastic carriers could be replicated for many other things, such as coffee stirrers and straws. Ministers are set to announce the new green powers in the Commons on Wednesday.It comes as Boris Johnson prepares to host the UN COP climate change summit in Glasgow later this month.It is hoped the charges will nudge consumers to use more sustainable items, after the plastic carrier bag charge cut sales in main supermarkets by %. The bill already contained laws to make it easier for ministers to introduce charges on single-use plastics, but the amendments push to introduce charges on all single-use products. “This change to the Environment Bill will mean we can put an end to ‘here-today gone-tomorrow’ throwaway culture and move towards sustainable alternatives,” a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs source has said. The campaign has been led by Labour ’s Shadow Environment Minister Baroness Jones of Whitchurch, who has been pushing for the change in the Government’s flagship Environment Bill.“This concession is an important first step in reducing our reliance on single-use items, which have an environmental cost whether they are made out of plastic or other materials such as wood, she told The i paper. “While we have welcomed the Government’s incremental bans on certain plastic items, it is clear that ministers need a wider range of tools to tackle the throw-away culture that creates unnecessary waste and litter.” Ruth Chambers of the Greener UK coalition said: “This is very welcome news. “A plastics only measure would have simply moved producers and consumers to single use alternatives that are often unrecyclable. “It is right that the Environment Bill should tackle our throwaway culture head on.” The levy on plastic carrier bags increased to p from p on May  and now applies to every retailer, from giant supermarket chains to corner shops, small clothes boutiques, butchers, greengrocers and airport duty-free stores Before this, the p levy only applied only to shops with more than  staff but it has resulted in the average person in England buying just four bags a year from the big store chains – a massive reduction from  bags each in . While it is thought the new scheme for all single-use items could be similar, the full details are not yet known.

The Labour leader went on: “The government could stop this by making it clear that directors of companies are criminally liable for material on their sites. “We donapost need to delay, so in the collaborative spirit we saw on Monday, will the PM commit to taking this away, looking at it again and working with all of us to strengthen his proposed legislation.” The Prime Minister committed to looking at “anything to strengthen” the long-awaited bill.  Asked to confirm whether the PM agreed with Mr Starmer on the need for criminal sanctions, the Prime Minister’s Deputy Spokesman said: “You have the PMaposs words. “We are obviously very much alive to this issue which is why we wanted to create a legal duty of care through the online safety bill and we will continue to listen and work with the companies involved and any recommendations will be considered in the usual way. Shadow Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Jo Stevens said: After months of campaigning by Labour it was heartening to hear that Boris Johnson has relented and will introduce criminal sanctions for senior tech executives who break the rules, as part of the long awaited Online Safety Bill.

From abusive behaviour that causes real damage and shuts down debate to the extremism that spreads terrying ideas and incites people to commit murder. After a three year delay, the Conservatives’ promised draft Bill has finally been published but it’s weak, ineffective and won’t do the job we need it to do.As the testimony from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen has shown, making money is all these companies care about.Facebook knew its app was damaging children’s mental health but chose to do nothing. Imaginea drugs company was selling something that made kids sick or a toy firm was selling dangerous a product, they would rightly suffer severe consequences.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  The first change we need in the Bill is to include criminal sanctions against the senior executives of the big companies for repeated breaches of the new law. We need a strong incentive to change the culture of those companies and how they operate. Without personal liability, nothing will change. And we know this works, we have it in health and safety law and in banking. Itaposs not good enough that the Conservatives left this out of their draft Bill.And it should not have taken Keir Starmer to push on this at PMQs for Boris Johnson to perform a U-turn.Another big omission from the Bill is a tough rule around legal but harmful content like racist abuse suffered by our footballers, misogyny suffered by just about any woman in public le and other abuse that makes le a misery but doesn’t hit a criminal threshold.  We need a tough duty of care on the companies which covers all that abuse because it can’t be left up to social media companies to self police it. They have already shown they can’t, or won’t do it voluntarily.After England lost the Euros final, Instagram said that monkey emojis used to attack Saka and other black players did not breach its rules. So self regulation by these companies has had its day. Finally there is a big worry that this Bill has a two tier approach to digital s putting tougher rules in place for the big “category ” sites like Facebook and Twitter but putting less stringent rules in place for the smaller sites.But as Hope Not Hate and the Anti Semitism Policy Trust and others have warned, it’s often the smaller s that host the most terrying and dangerous content with Twitter and Facebook acting as a shop window for the more extreme material. Labour believes this needs to be addressed because excluding these sites from stronger rules is playing into the hands of those who want to spread this dangerous extremism.On Wednesday, under pressure from Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister promised to bring in criminal sanctions and to bring forward the second reading of the Bill before Christmas. We will be holding him to these promises. We need our laws in place as soon as possible and for them to be effective to make all our online lives safer.

The Department for International Trade said the “groundbreaking” agreement will cut the price of New Zealand sauvignon blanc wine by p - which is its current tarf - and make Manuka honey and kiwi fruits cheaper. It will also create more chances for Britons to live and work in New Zealand - and “deeper cooperation on digital trade and climate change”, the ministry said. Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter UK-New Zealand trade was worth £.billion last year and is expected to grow under the deal. However, it was unclear what the agreement means for imports of New Zealand lamb. Welsh farmers fear cheap lamb from Down Under on British supermarket shelves could hammer the UK’s sheep farming industry. Mr Johnson said: “This is a great trade deal for the United Kingdom, cementing our long friendship with New Zealand and furthering our ties with the Indo-Pacic.  “It will benefit businesses and consumers across the country, cutting costs for exporters and opening up access for our workers.” Ms Ardern said: The United Kingdom and New Zealand are great friends and close partners the historical connections that bind us run deep. “This world-leading free trade agreement lays the foundations for even stronger connections as both countries embark on a new phase in our relationship. “It is good for our economies, our businesses and our people. British business leaders hailed the agreement.  Federation of Small Businesses chairman Mike Cherry said: “New Zealand has long been a priority market for UK’s small exporters – more than a quarter of which already sell there – and we welcome efforts to build on existing trade ties that go back many decades.” Food and Drink Federation international trade chief Dominic Goudie said: “Our manufacturers will benefit from an ambitious trade deal with New Zealand that removes a range of tarfs that currently constrain exports. “Signicant growth opportunities exist as UK production becomes more competitive in the New Zealand market.” But Shadow International Trade Secretary Emily Thornberry claimed the deal would mean job losses for Britain’s farming communities, produce no extra growth and “generate just £million in additional exports for UK firms compared to pre-pandemic levels”.  She said: “As our economy recovers from the pandemic, we need trade deals that will boost jobs and growth, open up big new markets for UK exporters, and support our objectives to buy, make and sell more in Britain. “This trade deal with New Zealand fails on every count. “It is a deal whose only major winners are the mega-corporations who run New Zealand’s meat and dairy farms - all at the expense of British farmers who are already struggling to compete. “But for British jobs, growth and exports, this deal is yet another massive failure.” National Farmers’ Union President Minette Batters said the deal meant Britain “will be opening our doors to signicant extra volumes of imported food - whether or not produced to our own high standards - while securing almost nothing infor UK farmers”.  The pact involves “signicant upsides for farmers on the other side of the world who can now access our hugely valuable market but contains little discernible benefit for UK producers, either at home or overseas”, she warned. Ms Batters feared it could “damage the viability of many British farms in the years ahead, to the detriment of the public, who want more British food on their shelves, and to the detriment of our rural communities and cherished farmed landscapes”. She added: “The Government is now asking British farmers to go toe-to-toe with some of the most export-orientated farmers in the world, without the serious, long-term and properly funded investment in UK agriculture that can enable us to do so.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON International TradeFederation of Small BusinessesBoris JohnsonRed tapePoliticsAnimalsNew ZealandBrexitAfter BrexitEmily Thornberry\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

With the addition of delays in the booster jab rollout, as well as immunity waning and a new Delta iant in the UK, it is feared restrictions may have to .But in the question is, what kind and when  What is the government’s plan to tackling Covid this winter   The government previously announced a Plan A and Plan B to tackle the spread of Covid- this winter, though the latter has yet to kick in. Plan A includes booster jabs for the over-s and other vulnerable groups, offering a first dose to  to -year-olds and advice to wear masks in enclosed spaces. Much of this is underway already but nevertheless infections are still rising at an alarming rate Plan A includes no additional restrictions introduced over winter, meaning there is no limit to how many people you can meet, and pubs and restaurants wonapost be closed. The government are hoping to avoid addition restricting by relying on the Covid booster jabs programme, which is being offered to around  million people, including the over s, younger adults with health conditions, and frontline health and social care workers. The NHS Test and Trace will continue, as well as the offer of free PCR test for those who have symptoms of Covid-. The government is also encouraging those who are being offered the flu jab to take it up. Brits are also being reminded to wear face coverings in crowded places, and let fresh in when meeting indoors, although this is not mandatory. According to government documents, in the event that “Plan A is not sufficient in keeping the virus at manageable levels”, Plan B will go ahead. However they have yet to make clear what the tipping point for this will be. What is Plan B   Plan B would involve theof mandatory masks, including in schools. According to the governmentaposs Autumn and Winter Plan document: If Plan B is implemented, the Government will bring back the legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings. The precise settings will be decided at the time. In addition, schools will be handed a contingency framework for what to dovirus cases surge. This could involve theof bubbles. Mandatory vaccine passports for venues could be activated at a weekaposs notice. Under Plan B, the government would also consider asking people to work from homethey can, for a limited period”. The document states: The Government recognises this causes more disruption and has greater immediate costs to the economy and some businesses than the other Plan B interventions, so a final decision would be made based on the data at the time. Clear guidance and communications will be issued to the public and businesses, setting out the steps they should take to manage the increased risks of the virus, although itaposs not yet clear what this would involve.To find out more about Plan B, you can read our separate guide here.Will there be another lockdown this winter   Do you think Plan A will work  Let us know in the comments below. The government has said itaposs very unlikely that the nation will go into lockdown. This is due to the success of the Covid vaccination programme, which will hopefully reduce transmission and relieve pressure on the NHS. The government is hoping that by outlining Plan A and Plan B, there wonapost be a need for a national lockdown this winter. However, although ministers expect Plan B measures to be sufficient to avoid a signicant increase in infections, there is no guarantee another lockdown is off the table. Dr Quinton Fivelman, Chief Scientic Officer at London Medical Laboratory, warned thatnumbers continue to increase the government would be forced to introduce a non-existent Plan C. However, the government has insisted lockdown would be a last resort. Speaking about the Covid lockdown plan on BBC Breakfast, Mr Javid said: No one wants to see another lockdown, I certainly don’t. I don’t think we are going to need to see another lockdown. I think the vaccines are working. “But I think it would be irresponsible for any health minister in the world to say that this or that is % ruled out. “Not least because I just don’t know whether at some time in the future – next year, the year after, the year after that – there might be a vaccine escape iant that doesn’t work with the current suite of vaccines.” Comment MORE ON NHSPlan BSchoolsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

His family are not a match and are now looking for a living donor before time runs out. Mum Rhiannon told GrimsbyLive : I was told by the doctors that he was born with only one kidney which was ing at just three to five per cent its normal .Without the transplant, he could die. I understand itaposs a major operation for someone to undertake. But Iaposm a mother who is scared of losing her son. Iaposm worried I will lose my baby boy. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter When little Roman was just a few weeks old he was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease , which is a long-term incurable condition where the kidneys do not work as well as they should. It gradually gets worse over time and eventually, the kidneys may stop working altogether. Roman is being kept alive through a dialysis machine that keeps his kidney ing. The toddler has been on PD dialysis since last November and has to be on the machine for eight hours a night.  Romanaposs only kidney is working on limited capacity and he urgently needs a kidney transplant. If his condition is untreated for much longer, the consequences could be fatal. Rhiannon said: The things you would be wary of with a normal child are even worse with a child-like Roman. He canapost crawl because of his catheter, he canapost walk because the dialysis makes him tired which means he sleeps a lot.If you are on the kidney transplant waiting list the best treatment option for you is to receive a kidney transplant from a living donor. If you have a friend or relative who would like to be considered as a potential donor for you please ask them to contact the transplant team below. You are unable to telephone on their behalf.Being a living kidney donorIf you wish to be considered as a living kidney donor please contact the Transplant Co-ordinators below at the centre which your friend or relative is registered. Please speak to your friend or relative before you register your interest as a living kidney donor.Once you have contacted the live donor team, the next stage of the assessment process is for you to complete anda donor health questionnaire. Here is a link to the questionnaire which can be accessed either from a PC desktop or a mobile tablet device. PLEASE NOTE: in order to complete the questionnaire electronically you will need to download and save it.Rhiannon asks that you ask place Roman Cookaposs name in recipient details. and his date of birth, which is   .Then a Leeds Living Donor Transplant Co-ordinator will deal with the initial enquiry from there on.Alternatively, Rhiannon has asked that you email Leedskidneyappeal@nhs.net  use aposROMAN COOKapos as the email reference.

He goes to Leeds Teaching Hospital for regular checkups Heaposs just the most wonderful human being and you wouldnapost be able to notice that he has a condition from looking at him. Heaposs always happy and smiley and makes you happy. But the pain and dficulty he faces is something he overcomes daily. Weaposre just really desperate to find my son a donor who can help transform his le because heaposs a happy, little boy who needs the help and care of someone to come forward and help him in his time of need. Roman is blood group type aposOapos and because of this, he will require a kidney from someone with the same blood group. Rhiannon said: Leeds Teaching Hospital will only consider undertaking the operationthe donor is healthy, below  years old as Roman is so young. The chances of finding the right donor are limited and we as a family are at breaking point to find the match. Roman is almost at the finishing line with all the tests and scans he has had to find the right donor, but weaposre just waiting for that one miracle that will make our dreams come true. Itaposs a le or death situation because Roman canapost live on dialysis forever. Weaposre desperate for a living donor because the success rates are much higher than those from a donor who is deceased. It can take weeks for the kidney to kick into action from a deceased person and it will likely lead to him needing more transplants in the future. The average waiting list for a deceased kidney donor transplant is two to three years. This has been made much worse by Covid- as there has been a lack of donors come forward because of restrictions.

Ministers are already facing pressure to implement Plan B, which will see compulsory mask wearing re-introduced, with people encouraged to work from home and vaccine passports required at hospitality venues. But with the NHS already stretched ahead of what is expected to be a dficult winter, medics warn that steps such as closing nightclubs must also be considered. Today the head of an all-party Parliamentary group on coronavirus accused the government of ignoring spiralling cases, making increased regulations more likely. In the past seven days more than , people have tested positive for Covid, while , people were in hospital with the virus, the Department of Health said yesterday. The UK is recording more than five times the rate of infections than many other European countries, with  Covid deaths reported in just seven days. Dr Deepti Gurdasani, public health researcher at the Queen Mary University of London, said thousands of lives could be saved in coming weeks - but the governmentaposs plan does not go far enough.  Dr Gurdasani told The Mirror that compulsory isolation for schoolchildren who have been exposed to Covid and the closure of poorly-ventilated venues like nightclubs over the winter must be considered. She said that at the current rate a further , lives could be lost to Covid in the two months to Christmas. Dr Gurdasani said: We need to remember that the NHS is in crisis, healthcare doctors will tell you that. Thereaposs very little leeway, emergency response times are high pretty much all across England. Right now people canapost get emergency care, which means avoidable deaths. Most people donapost realise that weaposre an exception to the rest of the world who arenapost tolerating this level of deaths. She described lockdowns as a failure of pandemic policy, and said measures such as closing nightclubs and isolation for schoolchildren who come into contact with Covid cases must be considered. Professor Deenan Pillay, who chairs the Independent Sage group, agreed that parts of Plan B will need to be strengthened, while MP Layla Moran, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus said nothing should be off the table.  During the second wave at the end of last year, parts of England were plunged into heightened restrictions, while a national lockdown was announced at the end of December as daily cases soared to more than ,. With the rollout of vaccines the number of fatalities has dropped dramatically. In January more than , deaths were announced for  consecutive days as the governmentaposs failure to respond to the Kent iant had tragic consequences. Daily death tolls are currently considerably lower, with yesterdayaposs figure of  the highest since July. Ms Moran, Lib Dem, told The Mirror: “As we see case numbers and deaths continuing to rise, it is clear that our NHS has once more been left on the brink of a Covid crisis.  “By continuing to ignore the importance of staying on top of case numbers, the Government is making mitigation measures such as mask wearing and ato home working increasingly likely. “When it comes to saving lives and protecting the NHS, however, nothing should be off the table and given the numbers of cases we are seeing, the Government is in no position to rule anything out.” Dr Gurdasani said that mask wearing - a key component in the governmentaposs Plan B - will help, but other steps will also be necessary. This means that the government may have to once again close crowded poorly-ventilated venues such as nightclubs, she said.Acting early and bringing in more measures will prevent Boris Johnson and co having to consider a lockdown, she said.She continued: Nightclubs are problematic, they are exactly the environment that Covid needs. Weaposve seen that large events can lead to thousands of infections, you just canapost keep people safe.  Lockdowns are presented as a main measure, but in reality itaposs a failure of early measures. Early action is what prevents lockdown. Driving up vaccination rates among young people and bringing in measures to improve ventilation in schools and workplaces are among the steps that need to be taken, Dr Gurdasani said. Professor Deenan Pillay, chairman of Independent Sage, agreed that Plan B does not go far enough. Thereaposs a lot in Plan B that can be useful, but there needs to be a strengthening in certain areas, he said. He said that CO monitors and airflow change devices should have already been rolled out in workplaces and schools - and said improving ventilation in these places must be a priority. I fully agree that schools should be open, but theyhavenapost wanted to deal with the work needed to make sure that schools are safe. Prof Pillay told The Mirror that there had been a suggestion that ensuring secondary school children have at least one dose of a Covid vaccine should be a priority.  I think that needs re-looking at, he said. He said he is in favour of vaccine passports, as they would reduce the risk of infections spreading in crowded places such as pubs and restaurants, and would incentivise people getting jabbed. Prof Pillay said it would be wrong to rule out a further lockdown, but said stronger measures can prevent the need for one. All think all things should be on the table, he stated.Itaposs always an option, we know that they did reduce infections, but I would say that comes at a cost, particularly for children. We should do everything in our power to keep schools open, but that means we should reduce as much as possible the risk of infections spreading. The government has said it will implement Plan Bit becomes clear the NHS is at risk of being overwhelmed. NHS Confederation boss Matthew Taylor, which represents the healthcare systems in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said the new curbs were needed or the UK would risk stumbling into a winter crisis. But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng ruled out imposing another lockdown - and even told Brits to go ahead with planning Christmas parties.

The cleaner said he initially went to the doctor about the issues around eight years ago, when he noticed blood whilst emptying his bowels. The doctor dismissed his concerns as nothing more than haemorrhoids, a diagnosis he accepted over the next few years as the bleeding continued. However, in March , the dad of two headed to the AE after struggling with pain while working night shts. Doctors at the emergency room gave him a scan, from which they determined that he was “just very constipated”. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletterI was coming home and doing yoga and gave myself colonic irrigation off a kit bought from Amazon. I was trying everything but I was still in a lot of pain,” he told the Liverpool Echo.Weeks went by and Michael went back to the doctor and was now told it was likely he was suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome . Still in pain months later and dissatisfied with the diagnosis, Michael took himself again to AE and was given a CT scan. When a lump was found in his bowel, further scans and tests were booked. Following these, he was asked to come into the hospital to speak with a doctor. It was on Christmas Eve that he received the devastating news he was dreading. Michael was diagnosed with a cancerous tumour in his bowel as well as in his liver and lung. When she told me I broke down,” Michael said. “I mean, Iaposve got two young kids. It was a lot to take in. In January this year, he underwent an intensive course of chemotherapy, which succeeded in shrinking the tumours in his liver and lung. However, the bowel tumour remained the same. Michael subsequently underwent a gruelling bout of radiotherapy in an attempt to try and reduce the size of the tumour. Despite feeling positive that the treatment was working and that surgery could now be an option, he was dealt another devastating blow upon learning that the tumour in his liver and lung had gotten bigger. Next week, he is due to start another course of chemotherapy which doctors have said has a % chance of working. Michael is also fundraising to try and raise enough money for a tailored treatment only available in Germany. During his terrible ordeal, Michael said the support he has had off his family has been incredible. Lyndsey has been amazing,” he said. Weaposve got two young kids together and sheaposs been picking up a lot of the slack because I canapost do anything really. I donapost let the kids see how ill I am. My daughter even said, aposDad itaposs weird, you donapost even act sickapos. Hopefully, please god, this chemotherapy can work,” he added. Once I got the diagnosis everything has been quick but until you get to that point itaposs hard. They said because I was young it was IBS and nothing to worry about. And when I was told I had piles as a young man - I was only about  - it was just embarrassing really. Following his tough experience, Michael was urging everyone to “go and get checked”. “If you feel assomethingaposs wrong just go,” he said. You know your own body better than anyone andyou feel assomethingaposs wrong just keep going.

Police chiefs said plain clothes officers were likely to be deployed in nightclubs although womensapos groups warned some women struggled to trust forces in the wake of Sarah Everardaposs murderer.Home Secretary Priti Patel has requested an urgent update from police following harrowing reports of women being injected at nightclubs across the country.Universities have said they are working with bars and police to help ensure studentsapos safety after the reports.Have you been affected by this story  Get in touch at webnews@mirror Campaigners call for changes to make night venues safer Groups from more than  universities around the UK have joined an online campaign calling for the boycott of nightclubs. Campaigners say they are seeking tangible changes to make night-time venues safer, such as covers stoppers for drinks, better training for staff and more rigorous searches of clubbers. A petition to make it a legal requirement for nightclubs to thoroughly search guests on entry, started last week, has already gained more than , signatures. The National Union of Students issue statement Larissa Kennedy, president of the National Union of Students , said: Itaposs absolutely disgusting that in the past few days a number of students have reported instances of women being spiked on nights out. My rage, love and solidarity goes out to all those who have been impacted by these violent acts, and all other women and marginalised folks who experience sexual violence on our campuses and in our communities. One studentaposs story A student has told how she believes she was spiked with an injection during a night out with friends as police say reports of spiking are on the rise.Zara Owen, , from Surrey, who is a student at the University of Nottingham, said she went for a night out with friends last Monday but then blacked out soon after arriving at a venue.Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she said: I went out with my friends to a nightclub in the city - nothing more than what we would usually do. I remember going to the bar, going to the toilet, going to the photobooth, and then after that moment my memory is a blank until I get home and Iaposm getting my phone charger. I know I didnapost drink as much as I usually would on a night out this night, and the fact that I donapost remember anything is terrying for me because this is something that is a very rare occasion to me.  Iaposve never suffered with memory loss and then the next morning, obviously I did with the memory loss, I woke up with a really painful leg. I found a pin prick in my leg which was the epicentre of all pain. It made me unable to walk and I was limping around. As a young person whoaposs at university, Iaposm hearing stories of people who have been to nightclubs and they have been injected. I have heard stories of someone having it through their hand or through their back so this kind of gave me an idea this had happened to me. Ms Owen added she was afraid that she may have contracted a diseasea dirty needle had been used. What did the university say  A University of Nottingham spokesperson said: We are extremely concerned by these reports - no-one should feel unsafe on a night out. We are working closely with Nottinghamshire Police and the cityaposs nightle venues to monitor, review and learn from incidents and experiences in the city centre. We have contacted them about the specic concerns raised and will continue to liaise with them to actively tackle societal problems and challenge behaviours.The NHS website provides some guidelines on what to doyour skin has been punctured with a used needle. They advise to aposwash the wound using running water and plenty of soapapos, aposdry the wound and cover it with a waterproof plaster or dressingapos and to not scrub the wound or suck any blood. Nottingham Policeaposs websites has some guidance on what to doyour drink has been spiked, but they currently do not have any guidelines on being injected. They advise to: Tell the people you’re with and make sure you’re someone where you feel safe. Alert a member of staff at the pub or club you are at. If you feel unwell you should seek medical attention immediately and tell them that you believe your drink has been spiked.Police in Nottinghamshire investigateNottinghamshire Police has seen a rising number of reports of spiking over recent months and are now stepping up operations to tackle the problem. Superintendent Kathryn Craner said: Over the last few months we have seen an increase in reports where people believe that drugs may have been put in their drink - thataposs due to the fact that they have experienced a distinctly dferent feeling to their normal reaction to alcohol. But weaposve also received a small number of reports where people are telling us, as Zara has, that this has been associated with a pain or a mark on a part of their body, scratching sensation, and as though they have been physically spiked. The force has arrested a man as part of the wider operation to tackle spiking in Nottingham. Police Scotland also investigate reports Police are investigating reports of people being spiked by injection in the Edinburgh, Dundee, Glasgow and Aberdeen areas. It follows reports on social media about people being targeted inside venues in Scotland. Police Scotland said a small number of reports from the four areas are being investigated but do not appear to be linked. The force has also received a report of a drink-spiking incident at a venue in the Stirling area and inquiries are ongoing. A Police Scotland spokesman said: We are aware of posts circulating on social media about spiking incidents involving injections in Scotland. Officers are carrying out inquiries, and a small number of reports from the Edinburgh, Dundee, Glasgow and Aberdeen areas are being investigated. These do not appear to be linked. We take all reports seriously and we would encourage anyone who believes they have been a victim of spiking in any form to contact police via .  What politicians are saying about the issue“ These are obviously vile crimes,” said Commons Home Affairs Select Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper.Ms Cooper, a former Shadow Home Secretary, said she received a report today from a victim who attended a hospital casualty unit last night “as a result of a possible injection spiking”. The victim “referred to there being three other people who were in the AE at the same time for spiking more widely, who were unable to walk as a result of drink spiking”.Home Secretary Priti Patel has requested an urgent update from police following harrowing reports of women being injected at nightclubs across the country.A Home Office source said: Weaposve asked the police to look into whataposs going on. We need to understand the scale of the problem. The thought of whataposs going on is just horrendous. What are the experts saying about it Some experts have cast doubt the use of needle spiking being a widespread phenomenon due to multiple iables such as the size of needle needed, the amount of liquid to cause an effect as well as the medical know-how needed to perform the injection.Guy Jones, senior scientist at drugs charity the Loop, told VICE World News: “GHB would be a poor candidate for injection due to the large amount of fluid needed, and therefore the thick, painful needle. This means that the substance involved would be something that would be highly detectable for several days in a toxicology screening such as a benzodiazepine.”David Caldicott, an emergency medicine consultant and founder of drug testing project WEDINOS, also said: “There are a couple of things that are disconcerting about this story. The technical and medical knowledge required to perform this would make this deeply improbable. It is at the level of a state-sponsored actor incapacitating a dissident, like the Novichok incident. The idea that a clubber would do this to a fellow clubber seems highly unlikely to me.

Crews had been called terried by the figure, thinking someone was hanging.When he let the -strong crew in they told him they were investigating reports of a concern for welfare.  Have you got a story youaposd like us to cover  Get in touch at webnews@mirrorThe man who has asked not to be named says: I was asleep in bed when I got a call from concierge to say the police were on their way up. I jumped out of bed in a scare I just totally panicked, I didnapost know what was going on, my kids were in the other room I had to check they were okay. I had police, paramedics, officers all come in. I switched on the lights and within minutes they realised it was the Iron Man sculpture and they just said aposwowapos and aposthataposs coolapos. The next thing they were taking selfies with it. It seems surreal now, but at the time it was really scary.  The man has lived in the flat for a year and said the sculpture has never caused any problems before now. Police officers told the man he should now move the sculpture as aposthe same thing could happen againapos, but he says itaposs simply too heavy. In a video from the scene, a police officer is heard saying: You need to move it, weaposll just keep getting calls. The homeowner is a fan of the Iron Man movies starring Robert Downey Jr, and bought the mammoth £, sculpture just before lockdown which features flashing eyes, chest and hands.  He says: Iaposve been here a year and no one has ever complained about the statue before. I mean we are really high up here. The officers were saying: you need to move Iron Manapos but itaposs just too heavy to do that. It was custom built and touches the ceiling. I just really like Iron Man and this lights up and everything, itaposs cool, I wanted it as a feature for the apartment. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: At around pm last night , police were called to reports of a concern for welfare on Deansgate, Manchester. Emergency services attended and established that there was no cause for concern. West Tower is one of the four huge new apartment blocks that has been built at the far end of Deansgate in the city centre as part of the Deansgate Square cluster. It boasts apartments spread across  floors, while the neighbouring South Tower is the largest of the four towers rising to  floors.

Betty finally decided she was brave enough to approach a handler offering a tasty treat on the st day of her stay at DogsRescue in Worsley. Bettyaposs transformation was slow but incredible, and the sweet moment was captured on video, the Manchester Evening News reports.The shelter wrote in a video caption: “Betty taking a treat from our hands. This moment has been  days in the making. “Probably the most broken rehab dog we have taken, her transformation whilst slow is incredible.  Moments like this are golden. We are so proud of you Betty.” Later that day they shared the full video, and said: “Betty taking a treat. She’s sat and watched other dogs do this thousands of times. Love, kindness, time and patience pay off in the end. “This was on her st day at our rescue. All in your own time, beautul girl. There’s no clock ticking on how long you can stay here.” In the video, the handler stays calm and still, offering out the treat while Betty is seen looking around tentatively, starting to approach several times, before doubling back, taking a few steps backwards, and then starting again. She then seemingly surveys the area to make sure that the coast is clear before walking up steadily towards the handler, finally taking the treat very gently before beating a hasty retreat. The tweet has gained more than , likes and nearly  comments, with users praising the rescue for allowing Betty to overcome her fears at her own pace. DogsRescue was founded by Emma in  with the aim to rehabilitate dogs across Europe and the UK to homes in the Manchester area. They pride themselves on being a kennel free environment, and believe in ‘pack rehabilitation’, allowing the dogs to enjoy a lestyle where they can exercise and socialise with the other animals, gaining confidence from each other, before eventually being rehomed.  One user said: “That is so beautul to see but I can’t help thinking what the beautul baby has been through to be so frightened. “Thank you so much for your patience and perseverance. You guys are truly amazing.” Another commented: “Bless her, so thankful to you for giving her the opportunity to express herself at her own pace without the time pressure of finding a home. “Thank you for the wonderful work you do.” A third said: “Breaks my heart to see her check her escape route first. Thank goodness she has you guys.”In a further post on Twitter, the rescue said: “Betty is a smart, sweet dog who was unbelievably afraid. It was unthinkable to us to end the le of a healthy dog just because they need time and patience.“It’s a privilege to be on this confidence building journey with her and watch her blossom into a happy member of our pack.” Comment MORE ON FitnessAnimalsDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Previous iants of the coronavirus have wreaked havoc as they can spike infection rates across the country.Health experts from the NHS are now encouraging the government to enact its contingency plan for further restrictions, which may include another lockdown. Business secretary Kwasi Kwateng said in response: This time last year we didnapost have the vaccine. We donapost want to go back into lockdown and further restrictions. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson added: As you know it’s something we’re keeping a very close eye on because of the strength of our genomic capability we are able to keep a very close watch on any iants that are emerging.What is the new Delta plus Covid iant  The new coronavirus iant, known as AY.., is an offshoot of the Delta strain, which is dominant across the world.Viruses mutate and change to fight against the antibodies that learn to kill them. It means immunity to viruses are often hard to keep up with. Some virus iants are more easily spread and can be more infectious. Some strains are also known to be more severe. Is the New Delta strain more transmissible  It is currently unclearthe new iant is indeed more severe or infectious. Tests are currently underway in an attempt to determine this. However, according to Dr Jeffrey Barrett, the director of the Covid- Genomics Initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge, and Prof Francois Balloux, the director of the University College London Genetics Institute, AY.. could be -% more transmissible than the original iant. He told the Financial Times: Its potential higher transmissibility could at this stage only explain a tiny fraction of additional cases. “It’s around % frequency [now], and assuming it may be % more transmissible, that would only explain an additional % extra infections [every five or so days].  However, the PMaposs spokesperson said: Thereaposs no evidence to suggest this iant, which I think is the AY. you are referring to, is more easily spread. There’s no evidence for that but as you would expect we’re monitoring it closely and won’t hesitate to take actionnecessary.” Thereaposs no evidence provided to us that we have seen that suggests it is more easily spread. Will the Covid vaccine still work  Experts say at this early stage, it is unlikely the new iant will escape the current vaccines. Tests are currently under way to establish how big of a threat this new iant poses. The Covid- Genomics UK Consortium , which tracks new iants, said the new iant “is likely to become dominant” in Britainit is found to be more infectious. However, it said there is no evidence to support this yet. More recently experts have argued there is a case for a Delta-specic vaccine, according to The Independent.

The Pack Horse, which is in the Peak District village of Hayfield, was visited by a group who didnapost complain when staff came and checked on them after they got their food. Staff say that the group chose to complain once theyaposd eaten most of the meal.The group allegedly tried to ask for a new dish, which was refused, and eventually left without paying the bill, Manchester Evening News reports. Owner and chef Luke Payne said that one member of the group then had the nerve to wink at him as they left. Were the diners right to leave  Have your say in the comments  The pub takes card details at the time of booking in case of no-shows or walk-outs, but the group reportedly said they would cancel their cards. Luke said the ordeal was immensely frustrating for him and his staff. He said: They were perfectly pleasant to begin with and then everything just changed. After theyaposd eaten about  per cent of the food, a lady brought her plate up to the bar and said it wasnapost to her liking, wasnapost what she expected, and could she swap to another meal for free   To which I said aposNoapos, because sheaposd eaten most of it and we canapost give food away for free when itaposs just personal preference. Thataposs not really how it works. Luke said his small team had already checked in with the group of customers and there were no complaints made about their food. When the group threatened to not pay their bill, Luke said he told them: aposThataposs not really acceptable, youaposve eaten most it, and you were given the opportunity to say there was something wrong with it.apos  He added: If theyaposd flagged it up in the check-back we could have done something to recty it. We donapost actively like making people unhappy, itaposs our job for people to have a really good night. We love people leaving with a buzz and knowing theyaposve had a great time with us, and  per cent of the people we have in are absolutely lovely and have a great time. We put in so much effort and passion and love, so every negative comment is taken personally. We will always do our utmost to fix a problemsomething is wrong -weaposve made a mistake weaposll hold our hands up and weaposll own it. So in an instance where absolutely nothing is wrong and people have kicked off, it hurts. The Pack Horse is one of the North Westaposs leading and most respected gastropubs, earning itself a place in the Estrella Dam Gastropubs list. Luke says that business has been great since they were able to reopen their doors after lockdown, but he says the post-pandemic kindness is fading. He said: I feel like there was a point in the pandemic where everyone was like aposBe kind, be nice. But Iaposve certainly noticed over the last couple of weeks that thereaposs been more stressed-out people with shorter tempers, and I know that thereaposs a lot of hard times for people at the moment, but it doesnapost take much to be nice to others. It was such a great opportunity to have that societal reset but I think some people have slipped back into their old ways. Business has been great, weaposve been so thankful for all the support weaposve had and weaposve been practically full every single weekend.

The man, known only as Owen, left the review minutes after leaving North Star in Cardf’s North Road in a huff on Tuesday afternoon. “Told off for having a sip of a shop-bought Coke from the shop alongside my overpriced pint so left, attitude problem,” wrote the enraged Owen.North Star’s manager David Rowlands then shared the scathing review on the business’s page, reports Wales Online. After viewing CCTV footage of the man, David wrote: “Dear Owen, you were politely asked to not consume your Tesco meal deal in a pub when the kitchen is open, as is standard practice in any food or drink establishment, and the price of our Blue Moon on draught is probably one of the lowest prices in the whole city.  “We have CCTV footage of our manager asking you politely to not consume outside food and drink in our venue.” David later said: “He came in with a bag, bought a pint, and then started consuming his meal deal. First the crisps, then the sandwich, then the bottle of Coke. One of our staff went over to him and told him he wasn’t allowed to consume food and drink from where on the site on our food-serving days. “On a Sunday evening and on a Monday, when we don’t serve food, we do allow customers to get a Subway or order food inthey want. It’s no problem for us and I don’t want them to go hungry. I don’t think many places would do that.” It isn’t the first time people have brought their own food onto the premises, David said. Not long ago a group of men thought they’d try their luck by bringing a few pasties with them.  He explained: “We’re only just starting to get some profit since we opened last August. We’re only now starting to work at full capacity again. And so it is quite frustrating when people come in with their own stuff. It would be nicepeople could make an effort to eat at their local independent establishments. The pub is trying things to entice customers by giving % off for students on a Wednesday evening and live music at weekends as the hospitality industry recovers from the y closures inflicted by the pandemic. They’ll also soon be doing karaoke nights on Sundays. David added: “We work hard and like to look after our customers and we work hard to have that iety on offer so it’s a shame when people decide to bring a Tesco meal deal in instead.” Comment MORE ON TescoCCTVPubs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The -year-old monarch was feeling “a little tired” on Tuesday evening, before royal doctors were called to her living quarters at Windsor Castle, it is understood. Upon waking on Wednesday morning, ahead of a planned departure from her Berkshire home at midday to travel to Belfast, the steely Queen was said to be “showing slight signs of a seasonal cold”.Her Majesty, who has had a jam packed schedule of engagements since ing from her summer break at Balmoral, took covid test which confirmed she was not suffering from coronavirus. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up But palace medics advised her to take a period of “immediate rest” for the next few days. The nation’s longest reigning monarch is resting at Windsor Castle but will still receive her ministerial red boxes which she will attend to. She is still expected at this stage to host a reception in Glasgow on November  for the Cop climate change conference. Several engagements in her diary for next week remain as yet unchanged, but courtiers said they would maintain a “cautious view” with any plans. The Queen was set to attend a series of engagements at Hillsborough Castle on Wednesday and Thursday attend a service in St Patrick’s Church, Armagh to commemorate the centenary of the foundation of Northern Ireland. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “The Queen has reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days.  “Her Majesty is in good spirits and is disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland, where she had been due to undertake a series of engagements today and tomorrow. “The Queen sends her warmest good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland, and looks forward to visiting in the future.” It emerged this week that the Queen turned down the ‘Oldie of the Year’ trophy because she feels she does not meet the criteria, believing “you are only as old as you feel”. Despite her period of rest to take it easy, the Queen was spotted on Wednesday driving around the Windsor estate and enjoying taking her dogs for a walk. A royal source said: “The Queen’s enthusiasm for ing to a fully packed schedule of engagements following the coronavirus restrictions being lted has been incredibly admirable. “There is certainly no cause for alarm.  “Her Majesty doesn’t know any other pace than full on and used to being incredibly busy, especially of late, but perhaps it is in her best interests that she takes this time to rest and recuperate before she starts once again.” Courtiers believe the cancellation of the Queen’s trip will serve as a reminder that the head of state - at the age of  - cannot do what was expected of her  or  years ago. In recent weeks she has for the first time been seen walking with a stick at public engagements. Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine, said the Queen’s autumn schedule had been more crammed than expected, but last-minute cancellations were inevitable in the future. Since the Queen ed from Balmoral Castle at the start of October, she has met Canadian troops at Windsor, launched the Queen’s Baton Relay for the Commonwealth Games, attended the Royal British Legion centenary service at Westminster Abbey, travelled to Cardf for the Welsh Senedd opening, and hosted a global investment summit reception, as well as holding audiences and video calls.  Mr Little said: “I think when you get to the age of  and you have a role such as the Queen has, there is an inevitability about last-minute cancellations. “Unfortunately, I think this is just how it’s going to have to be from time to time. “The fact that she has been busy and seemingly healthy and happy of late shows that clearly looks can be deceptive unless something has happened overnight.” He added: “Mentally, the Queen is pin sharp as ever and when she makes speeches she speaks well. “But you notice that the body is perhaps a little bit less so. “Every now and again there will be this reminder that she is  and she can’t do what was expected of her ,  years ago.  Just five years away from her th birthday and next year due to celebrate her Platinum Jubilee -  years on the throne, the nation’s longest reigning monarch still keeps a busy diary of events and audiences and deals with her daily red boxes of official papers. She held two audiences on Tuesday via video link from Windsor Castle, greeting the Japanese ambassador Hajime Hayashi and the EU ambassador Joao de Almeida, followed by a reception for business leaders including Microsoft founder Bill Gates in the evening. At the weekend, she enjoyed a day at the races at Ascot, and on Monday held a virtual audience with the new Governor-General of New Zealand. Royal sources said the Queen’s “enthusiasm to get on with the job” has shown now sign of letting up, but most conceded she would be advised to “take her foot off the gas” to maintain her health. It was revealed last week that Her Majesty had taken the “personal decision” to give up regular drinking by her doctors as she keeps up a busy schedule ahead of her Platinum Jubilee celebrations.  Due to her age the Queen is expected to have had her Covid booster jab, following her first inoculation in January.At the time she broke with protocol to announce she had been given her first injection, alongside husband Prince Philip, from a royal doctor at Windsor Castle.The head of state made the personal decision to let it be known she had accepted the vaccine to send a “message of hope” to the country, as Britain reaches a crisis point in the battle against coronavirus.

The home in Oldham, Manchester houses people aged  and over who are typically considered vulnerable. The cost for the accommodation is £ per week and include service charges for cleaners and usage of the lt. Julie Baker is a long term resident at St Margaret’s having lived there for  years. She has been left frustrated by the most recent leaks, with a bin full of water being left outside her flat.Julie told the Manchester Evening News : The outside of my flat is disgusting and theyaposve told me they want to come in and dig the kitchen floor up, while Iaposm still in there, because they say thereaposs a pipe underneath thataposs cracked. We have a cleaner that we pay for but they werenapost even here half an hour today and I still have to mop the floor myself in laundry room. Itaposs disgraceful really because weaposre all vulnerable in one way or another. My mum hasnapost come to visit since Iaposve been here because sheaposs embarrassed of the place. She doesnapost swear but she calls it a s***hole.  Another resident who has lived in the building for nine years has reported numerous times regarding a mice infestation in his property but claims that it has not been resolved. He said: Iaposve still got them now, I can feel them at night. They tell me Iaposm leaving food about but all my food are in plastic containers in the fridge or freezer. Itaposs the st century, it shouldnapost be like this.  Phil used to live in Julieaposs flat but he had to move out as it was, in his words, p***ing water. He has since moved into Julieaposs old flat, which has been left semi-decorated. Itaposs angin mate, he said. We just want somewhere nice to live. Iaposm basically just living in my bedroom. Theyaposve not done anything to the flat since I moved in. I had an electrician round the other day to sort something out and even though there were two other simple jobs I asked him to do, he said he couldnapost due it because it had to be logged. You complain but they just tell you that youaposre imagining things. Eventually their concerns were put across to the housing association and since then, they have apologised to the residents for aposfalling below the standards they deserveapos and promised to carry out full inspections.  Joanne Scarlett, Riverside’s head of asset strategy and delivery, blamed a roof leak for some of the problems the residents have faced. She said: We apologise unreservedly to our retirement living customers at St Margaret’s Gardens in Oldham. We take all complaints extremely seriously and our team are speaking to customers to discuss progress in resolving the issues they’ve experienced and how we can come to a speedy resolution. We will also carry out a full inspection of each inidual apartment over the coming days and weeks. The root of the problem is a leak in a glass roof in the reception area. We have also been renewing guttering for this roof, where drainage had been blocked and water was backing up, causing a range of issues which have affected customers’ properties.

Arthur Labinjo-Hughes had more than six spoons worth of salt in his system at the time of his death in June last year, a court heard. Consultant pathologist Dr Roger Malcolmson told a murder trial at Coventry Crown Court it was aposhighly unlikelyapos the boy poisoned himself. Thomas Hughes, aged , and his then-girlfriend Emma Tustin, , stand accused of killing his son Arthur at their home in Cranmore Road, Shirley. They both deny murder and multiple counts of child cruelty.  Giving evidence today - Tuesday, October  - Dr Malcolmson stated it was aposmore likelyapos Arthur was aposrepeatedly poisoned with salt contaminated food or fluidsapos in aposbrutal controlling circumstancesapos. He told the court it was less likely he was given a single portion of salt shortly before he collapsed at the Shirley home on June . Asked whether his raised sodium levels, combined with dehydration, would have contributed to Arthur being aposless physically able to resist a fatal assaultapos the expert witness said: Thataposs my suggestion, yes. If he had been suffering health side effects from being poisoned to the extent he is likely to have been in this case, then yes he may not have been able to put up much of a fight.  Dr Malcolmson had earlier told the jury that Arthur suffered apossevereapos eye injures, including a detached retina, aposvery rarely seenapos in child head trauma cases. The expert described them as apostowards the extreme endapos of the scale and put them down to apossevere blunt force traumaapos to Arthuraposs head. He said: At minimum, there has been a very signicant head impact, there may have also been a shaking-type mechanism.  Dr Malcolmson reiterated his belief that the cause of Arthuraposs death was a head injury which could not have been self inflicted because the boy would not have been able to generate enough force himself, the court heard. The court also heard that Arthuraposs left kidney was aposextremely smallapos while his thymus lymphoid organ in his chest appeared to have shrunk. Dr Malcolmson stated the latter was likely caused by apossevere and or prolonged physical stressapos and confirmed it could have been brought on by aposrepeated and sustained abuseapos.  It is alleged Tustin and Hughes aposisolated Arthur from the familyapos, aposassaulted himapos, aposdeprived him of water and made him stand in the hallway where he spent up to  hours a dayapos, the court was previously told. They both deny murder. Tustin has admitted one child cruelty offence but denies three others. Hughes denies all four counts.

Coastal areas are expected to be affected the most, Météo-France has warned. The French national meteorological service has named the storm, as more signicant impacts are expected there. The storm is expected to move through the English Channel late on Wednesday and into Thursday, bringing some severe weather for France, while some southern areas of the UK will see some lower-key impacts. The Channel Islands will see higher winds than the mainland UK overnight, Wales Online reported. The northern part of the frontal system wrapped around Storm Aurore glances into southern England as the system moves eastwards.Associated heavy rain has led to the Met Office to issue ayellow warning for rainthat covers southern England, from pm on Wednesday to am Thursday morning. However, the most impactful and widespread impacts associated with Aurore will be in its southern flank, which sits over northern France.The heavy rain in England could see between mm and mm fall in the warning area, with up to mm possible in some places. With this, will come coastal gales, with winds of up to mph possible in some exposed locations, and widely breezy where.  Met Office Chief Operational Meteorologist Dan Suri said the worst weather associated with the storm would be on its southern flank, over northern France. “The northern edge of Aurore will catch southern England, dealing us a glancing blow,” Suri said. “What this means for us is some heavy rain this evening and overnight. The Channel Islands, however, being closer to France, will be more directly in the firing line and experience high winds this evening and overnight. “Of course, high winds will also affect the English Channel so marine interests are encouraged to keep abreast of the shipping forecast.” Comment MORE ON Met OfficeWeather warningWeather\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A drone operator in Spain was yesterday granted permission to attempt to save the three malnourished dogs stuck near the volcano in the Canary Islands. For weeks the poor dogs have been stranded in an abandoned yard covered in volcanic ash surviving on food packages sent to them by drones. Hot gas surrounding the area has made it impossible to fly helicopters as it can damage the rotors. Emergency officials stated in a statement that they had decided to authorise the intended rescue attempt after assessing it.  Aerocamaras CEO Jaime Pereira said he planned to send a  kilogramme drone fitted with a large net to try to catch the dogs one by one and carry them to safety m over streaming lava. Itaposs the first time an animal is being rescued with a drone and the first time it has to be captured, Pereira said. If thataposs the last option that the dogs have  Then weaposre going after them. The operator will only have four minutes to lure a dog to the net and another four minutes to fly it out.  What we donapost want is to run out of battery when flying over the lava, Pereira said. Test flights are still being carried out. Ultimately, the mission depends on how the dogs will respond to the machine, Pereira said. Theyaposve been eating very little for weeks. They might come, or become scared of the drone. We really depend on their reaction.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON VolcanoesAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A court heard the plastic-wrapped bundles of notes were found in several shopping bags during a police raid at the home of Pero Mitrovic in Kensington, London, where he rented out a room to Milan Kosoric. Officers also found just over g of cocaine and drugs paraphernalia at the property and in a parked car outside. Prosecutor Tim Hunter told Maidstone Crown Court that the amount of cash found plainly doesnapost equate to the small quantity of the class A drug which had been ided into  deals. Both men, who have no previous convictions in the UK or their native country, admitted possessing criminal property in respect of the cash on a jointly owned basis.  Mitrovic, , was jailed on October  for  months and -year-old Kosoric, who also pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine with intent to supply, was sentenced to a total of four years and three monthsapos imprisonment. The flat in Redclfe Street was raided on March  this year and the cash totalling £, was found in Kosoricaposs rear bedroom. Mr Hunter said: The cash was bundled up and marked into separate amounts and kept in a iety of robust supermarket shopping aposbags for leapos. Police also found six bags containing the vast majority of drug deal bags, a sealing machine and money counter. A further  cocaine wraps were found in a VW car. Craig Rush, defending Kosoric, said he had been entrusted by those further up the chain to act as a storekeeper for the drugs and money. Tony Wyatt, defending Mitrovic, told the court he knew the money was related to crime but not that it came from drug trafficking.He added: He could and should have put a stop to what was happening and ask his co-defendant to leave the flat. However, Judge Charles Gratwicke said it beggared belief that on seeing the money and paraphernalia he would not have known what was going on. Passing sentence, he told Mitrovic: You clearly must have been aware of the criminal activity that was going on, you clearly were permitting that criminal activity to take place, and there is little doubt that there was to be some personal gain.  Jailing Kosoric, Judge Gratwicke added he had played an active role in the illicit operation. Class A drugs bring with them nothing but misery, degradation and occasionally death to those who become addicted, he said. Those who prey upon the addiction class A drugs bring can expect to receive immediate prison sentences to reflect societyaposs abhorrence of the evil trade and to deter others. Detective Superintendent Lee Morton of Kent Police who investigated the case, said: Kosoric and Mitrovic both occupied key roles in an organised criminal network, and whilst both of them may not have directly orchestrated the drug supply chains running into Kent, they had clearly been entrusted to look after and redistribute vast sums of criminal cash. Both men have now rightly been jailed and the fact that we have been able to successfully and permanently seize all the money is equally important. Some of the work we do can take months of painstaking investigation but it is important that people see that we wonapost allow criminals to benefit from their illegal activity. Any ill-gotten cash will be taken from them and where possible redistributed to our local communities for everyoneaposs benefit.

Earlier on Wednesday a suspected mini tornado caused havoc in Widnes, Cheshire with garden walls, bins and ornaments flung onto the main road.  Police have received reports of damage to properties, fallen walls, smashed car windows and debris on Widnes streets. Now, residents of Ferring in West Sussex have taken to social media to claim they have also been struck by a tornado, with damage to gardens. One person said: I’m in Ferring, i was in my daughter’s room at the time and we heard a bang and the windows shook and both wondered what on earth has happened.  Another said: We wondered what on earth was going on outside! Hope everyone is safe. A third person wrote: It’s terrible out there. I’ve just driven from Worthing to Ferring outskirts and it was not a pleasant experience and there’s a lot of standing water on the roads. Locals shared photos of damage to their gardens, including a smashed brick wall and toppled furniture. Torro, the UKaposs Tornado and Storm Research Organisation, asked residents to share their stories and send photos of damage to their gardens. One person replied: I am part of the team from Southern UK Stormchasers... we have had members reporting a possible tornado but as yet unconfirmed also.

Fleas are finding perfect conditions for spreading in carpeted homes where the central heating is kept on all day long. These dubbed “super fleas” are breeding fast and are dficult to kill as they are resistant to many treatments.Experts are saying that the situation has been made worse by plenty of new pet owners who have bought animals during the pandemic.Chris Socratous, a pet care expert at Bob Martin told The Sun that people need to take steps to prevent them getting into homes in the first place.He said: Weaposve seen some really unusual weather patterns across the UK in recent months. When you combine this with thousands of potentially first-time or inexperienced owners who welcomed a pet into their home during the ious lockdowns, we could be facing one of the worst flea and tick seasons for years. The advice is to be well informed about what treatments are available for fleas and be aware of the dangers including Lyme disease that is a potentially le threatening infection. Fleas primarily, though, cause plenty of itching and chemists around the country have reportedly seen a rise in sales of creams for bites. Pet owners are also being urged to apply anti-louse treatments correctly as and when necessary. The British Pest Control Associationhas warned an infestation can rapidly spiral out of control as the creepy-crawlies reproduce.Female fleas can lay anywhere up to , eggs during their lespan, which means a few fleas can quickly create a large population of the biting parasites, reported LeicestershireLive.Dee Ward-Thompson of the BPCA said: “Female fleas take a ‘blood meal’ from an infested animal, then lay their eggs, which drop onto the floor and surrounding furniture before developing into larvae.“It is crucial to tackle a flea infestation without hesitation as they can quickly get out of control.”BPCA is urging people to be aware of the six signs of fleas, which are: Pets constantly scratching, licking or biting themselves Fleas or flea droppings visible in the coat of your petBlack specks that fall from your pet as you comb them which then turn redyou put them on paper and add water Members of the household getting bitten around the anklesBites on arms after you have been holding your petSpotting small insects on soft furnishings that jumpComment MORE ON VampiresInsects\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Anna Gronowska said her block of flats in Trafford, Greater Manchester, has been experiencing issues since Friday.The woman said she found out the shared pump room on the ground floor of the building had water gushing out of it like a waterfall, so she contacted the local utilities company, the Manchester Evening News reports.However, she was told that the pipes in the area were operating fine and that it could be an isolated incident relating to her building. Anna then contacted Portland Block Management, who runs the building, and informed them of the problems at The Park apartments in Chester Road.  She said: We’ve been living without water since Friday. It could be dangerous and it is a real worry that something worse could happen soon. This isn’t just a simple leak, it’s a waterfall that’s just flowing out everywhere - itaposs a nightmare. Anna said the management company told her they had tried to fix the issues several times but contractors needed to be called out. She added: I could understandit took  or  hours to fix but itaposs now five days and we still donapost have water. There are vulnerable and older people living in the building and I’m concerned that the flats nearest the water pipe could get water damageit’s not sorted soon.  The management company said the complex problem had been caused by a fracture in the main water pipes. Equipment in the building’s pump room had also been accidentally damaged. A spokesperson for Portland Block told the M.E.N.: This is an extremely complex job to remedy and has involved multiple contractors and repeated visits. We have kept a timeline of all responses and ongoing work from the point the matter occurred. We have provided water during this period and have advised residents that we will continue to do so until the matter is resolved. We have kept in contact with residents by phone, email and have also hand delivered letters to each apartment. We are hopeful the matter will be brought to a close by tomorrow .

Megalodons, meaning aposbig toothapos, are a now-extinct shark species that once swam in the Earthaposs waters. They are believed to have lived from about  to . million years ago, from the Early Miocene to the Pliocene eras. Captain Michael Nastasio, from the city of Venice in Sarasota County, found the    inchestooth just off the coast of his home city, while on a shark-tooth chartering trip with his company: Black Gold Fossil Charters. The area is noted for the shark teeth found on the local sea bed. While Michael has found many other shark teeth in the past, he said he would be keeping this one due to how impressive it was.  He said: I have been fossil hunting for almost  years, and running my own charter now for a little over a year. I have found thousands of Megalodon shark teeth and other ious fossils.” After the discovery last week, Michael said he was in awe of the huge fossil. I canapost take my eyes off of it, he said. Megalodons were previously classied as part of the Lamnidae family, which would have meant that they were closely related to great white sharks . However, they are now listed as part of the Otodontidae family, which is extinct. Megalodons are often considered to have been one of the biggest predators on the planet. Michael said his job means he is in the water with the customers a lot. “You can hear them underwater when they find a tooth,” he said. “You can hear them yell... It just makes you feel good. In , the American-Chinese sci-fi film aposThe Megapos was released starring British actor Jason Statham, that was based on a group of scientists encountering a -foot-long Megalodon shark while on a rescue mission at the bottom of the Pacic Ocean.

Police in New Zealand jumped into action and having headed to his home an officer was able to confirm that he did in fact have cool toys. The recording of the call was shared on social media by police in the South Island city of Invercargill. While they do not encourage children to ring the emergency number, officers alleged the call was “too cute not to share”. The call begins in standard fashion, with the emergency operator saying: “This is police, where is the emergency ” After a pause the unidentied boy hesitantly says: “Hi”, and then “police lady ” The dispatcher responds in a softer tone: Yes. “What’s going on ”  “Um, can I tell you something ” the boy asks, before adding: “I’ve got some toys for you.” The woman then said: “You’ve got some toys for me  And he replied: “Yep. Come over and see them!” A man then picks up the phone from the boy and confirms the call was a mistake and there was, in fact, no emergency. Still, a police dispatch call then goes out, providing the address and stating clearly: “There is a four-year-old there who is wanting to show police their toys, over.” An officer pounces into action, saying: “Yeah I’m one up, I’ll attend to.” Police said the officer, identied only as Constable Kurt, attended the address, whereupon he was shown a selection of toys. He later confirmed to his fellow officers that, as he had testied, the boy did indeed “have cool toys”. The force also shared a photo of Constable Kurt with the boy sitting happily on the bonnet of his police car and wearing the officer’s hat, saying the lad had even ben treated to seeing its flashing lights in operation.

Along with the traditional orange pumpkins, you may also spot people out and about with teal or blue ones too.The blue pumpkin buckets are being used by trick or treaters to show households they have autism, Manchester Evening News reports. The idea was started by a mother in America who explained her decision in a Facebook post which has been shared thousands of times.She wrote: If you see someone who appears to be an adult dressed up to trick or treat this year carrying this blue bucket, he’s our son! His name is BJ  he is autistic. “While he has the body of a  year old, he loves Halloween.  Please help us keep his spirit alive  happy. So when you see the blue bucket share a piece of candy. Spread awareness! These precious people are not “too big” to trick or treat. “Love this idea! Hope he has a great Halloween,” one person commented. Another said: “I will be ready and waiting for BJ.” According to the NHS website, people with autism frequently have issues with social interaction and communication. By making it clear to others that a trick or treater is autistic, the hope is that households are receptive to a slightly dferent kind of interaction. Teal pumpkins may also be seen due to another campaign which also started in America in . The Teal Pumpkin Project is an awareness campaign from Food Allergy Research and Educationwhich aims to make sure children with food allergies or other dietary restrictions can also enjoy trick or treating. According to the FARE website, a teal pumpkin placed on a doorstep symbolises safety, inclusion and respect of iniduals managing food allergies.

He unexpectedly held on for minutes after being lted from the ground. Tragically the crew member then fell when the balloon was hundreds of feet into the air. Police confirmed his death as he crash landed on a car, which was driving below.The man had worked for the Lagaat Bashamayim balloon company for the last few months, news outlet Haaretz reports.  They say that under regulations, three ground crew members must hold onto a balloon before it is inflated so that it is stabilised before it takes to the air. But Mr Cohen didnapost let go of the bottom of the basket after the balloon was inflated - and it took off with him still holding on.  He was captured on camera hanging from the side as worried people below yelled to attract attention. Lagaat Bashamayim owner Almog Amir says he is still struggling to come to terms with what happened.  “We’re all in shock,” he said. “He was a great guy. “He tried to land after crossing the road, but the wind brought him back. And at some point, Yogev could no longer hold on and fell onto the road from a height of  or  meters. “He hung onto the lower portion of the basket. By the time the pilot noticed this, he was already at a height of  or  meters.  “I’ve been flying hot air balloons for  years, and so far, I haven’t been able to understand why he did this. “Then they yelled to him from below ‘Jump, jump,’ while he was still near the ground. He said something like ‘No, I’m hanging in there,’ and then the pilot decided to get lower. But there were power lines and he couldn’t do so.

students with a spate of flashing incidents just weeks after their arrival in Aberdeen.The students have been left distressed by the behaviour they are being exposed to at Seaton Park, just beside the Hillhead halls of residence.Details of the incidents emerged during a meeting of Old Aberdeen Community Council last night.Student Henry Jaspars reported the concerns, pleading with the community group to fight for action.Henry said: #There are problems regarding people flashing in Seaton Park, and numerous students are feeling unsafe.#These are first year students coming here for the first time, and I think something needs to be done about that.#It#s a big concern.#The majority of the incidents are thought to have taken place #later in the evening#.But with winter drawing in, the park will frequently be dark as students head home from afternoon lectures.Caretaker chairman of the community council, David Craik, said problems at the park stretch back decades.He added: #It can be a dangerous place, it has been an issue for so many years.#Member Lekky Shepherd suggested the university should issue guidance on #the safest ways to go back and forth from halls#.She added that there is very little time dference between walking around Seaton Park, along Don Street, compared to cutting through it.And Lekky questioned whether more lighting, and CCTV cameras at the gates, could act as a deterrent.David suggested perpetrators could be put offthey #knew they were being pictured on the way in and out#.A police spokeswoman said complaints regarding indecent exposure are #taken very seriously#.She added: #We appreciate the adverse affect this type of behaviour can have on anyone who witnesses it.#People should call they have any information on the recent lewd acts, or ring #immediately#they want to report an ongoing incident.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: “We have always advised the public not to use the park in the dark and this approach has always been backed by the police.#There are well-lit routes around the park which should be used. We will continue to liaise with police colleagues to seeadditional measures are required.#Nick Edwards, head of student support at the university, said: “We would encourage students – and indeed the general public – to avoid accessing the park in the dark and instead make use of the lit walkways around King Street and Don Street.“Alongside Police Scotland, we continue to raise awareness to our student body of the dangers of walking through the park at night, and reinforce messages throughout the year, and during orientation, about personal safety.“We encourage all students to make use of our free bus service where they can to get to and from Hillhead and campus, and we have our SafeZone app they can download to directly engage with university security or emergency servicesthey feel at risk.#Nich added that reminders about the risks will be issued #throughout the winter and beyond#.Victim Support Scotland says indecent exposure incidents #can lead to anxiety, fear and feelings of distrust and violation#.The charity offers support and information on its free, confidential helpline at   .Its website states: #If you or someone you care about has been affected by an indecent exposure incident, please know that you are not alone.#Whoever you are, whatever the situation and whenever the crime took place, we can help you.#Girls night in: Boycott of Aberdeen nightclubs planned to combat drink spiking\" title\"#Girls night in: Boycott of Aberdeen nightclubs planned to combat drink spiking# # Press and Journal\" src\"https:www.pressandjournal fp news aberdeen-aberdeenshire  girls-night-in-boycott-of-aberdeen-nightclubs-planned-to-combat-drink-spiking embed # secretniWsuoKnoi\" data-secret\"niWsuoKnoi\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.33243407-1wjp0nsn4-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.33243407-1wjp0nsn4-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.33243407-1wjp0nsn4-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.33243407-1wjp0nsn4-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"this is why raf jet was heard over aberdeen today","story":"A RAF Lossiemouth Typhoon jet has had to make an unexpected landing in Aberdeen.

However, with victory against Oman on Thursday assuring qualication for the Super , there can be little better time for the Scotland lynchpin to rediscover his touch.#Kyle has not had the performances he prides himself on, but he’s been a consistent performer for this team for a number of years,# said Burger. #Kyle is not only the leader in the team, but probably the person to thank for the way the brand of cricket has changed. The braveness in how he wants to play has certainly resonated within the team.#I’ve no doubt Kyle is only one day or one performance away from nailing his form. I’ve never seen a batter hit the ball as well in the nets in my le. He’s just got to take that into a match.#He’s also an inspiring leader and brings a sense of calm. Tactically in the last two games he’s got a lot right and I can certainly see the players are following him.#I’ve got an incredible relationship with him and he’s a fantastic human being. I can’t think of anyone  that deserves success more than him.#Scotland have already broken a number of barriers to get to this stage. They have doubled their number of wins at T World Cups, recorded their highest score at this tournament and Richie Berrington became the first Scotland player to hit a T World Cup fty.Their win over Papua New Guinea on Tuesday sees them head into the game in Muscat first in Group A with four points. Three wins from three would clinch top spot and see Scotland advance to the Super , where the world#s best nations lie in wait.#It’s a fantastic place to be – we’d rather be where we are now than in any other place,# added Burger. #If you’re not looking forward to competitive sport sitting in the position we’re in then you’re in the wrong game. This is high pressure and high expectation.#There’s a nation’s hopes resting on the game and we know what that all represents. We’ve already created history by winning two games, more than any other Scottish team has done previously. But we want to take it one step further.#All the goals we’ve set have been over and beyond this group stage. We’ve spoken a lot about getting into round two and what we want to achieve there.#We know we have to take it one step at a time and I’m incredibly proud of the calm this unit has shown.#Being a full member of the ICC, rather than one that plays just T and one-day cricket, is a long-held goal for Cricket Scotland.They have been one of the most consistent associate nations in recent years, but ultimately the step up to the next level is out of their hands.#In many ways the goalposts are not really there for us to make that decision,# said Burger. #That will come at a time when you’ve earned it. I’ve no doubt that this team is very near to doing that.#Full membership is just a tag. It doesn’t define a mindset or a behaviour within your team.

monitored by the Scottish Government, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.Known scientically as AY.., some reports suggest thatthe iant has the potential to beslightly more transmissible that the original Delta iant, which itself is much more transmissible that the original Covid iants discovered in .However, with tests currently underway, there is so far no indication that it is signicantly more transmissible, and experts are keen to acknowledge that virus mutation is very common and not necessarily reason for concern.With this in mind, heres what we know about the so-called Delta plus iant...What is Delta plus AY.., or Delta plus, has been described as a \"descendant of Delta\" and was discovered by scientists in July , shortly after Delta became the predominant iant in the UK.While the new iants presence is increasing in the UK, it is not rising as fast as the original Delta earlier this year.Experts are monitoring the iant, however ithas notbeen deemed a\"iant under investigation\" or a \"iant of concern\".Delta plus has mutations which impact the spike protein, which viruses use to attack the bodys cells.If examination finds that this iant is likely to be more infectious than the original Delta, it will be promoted to a \"iant under investigation\".More tests will then be done to determine whether it should become a \"iant of concern\".The good newsis that currently experts do not believe that Delta plus will take hold, meaning it could drop off the watch list soon.What do experts say about Delta plus Professor Francois Balloux, director of University College Londons Genetics Institute, said \"dont panic\" regarding the new iant, which is \"nothing\" like the situation with Alpha or Delta.\"Its nothing compared with what we saw with Alpha and Delta, which were something like  to  percent more transmissible. So we are talking about something quite subtle here and that is currently under investigation.\"It is likely to be up to  percent more transmissible.\"Its good that we are aware. Its excellent that we have the facilities and infrastructure in place to see anything that might be a bit suspicious.\"At this stageI would say wait and see, dont panic. It might be slightly, subtly more transmissible but it is not something absolutely disastrous like we saw previously.\"What have Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson said about Delta plus In a tweet posted on Tuesday afternoon, Nicola Sturgeon said: \"The need to monitor this was discussed #at Scottish Government# Cabinet earlier.\"More generally, cases here - though lower than few weeks ago - remain higher than wersquod like.\"So pls take care: wear masks, wash hands, ventilate indoor spaces  get vaccinated.\"Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Boris Johnson said:\"Its something were keeping a

defeat.And last Saturday#s defeat came about through a goal each in the early and late stages of the match, despite a strong showing from the Kintyre Park side.Playing in a ---, Tarbert#s Craig Johnstone ed to central defence and John McCallum played on the left wing in place of the unavailable Rhys Casci, while Liam Renton ed to the fray on the right of the front three, in place of the injured Ross Brown.To compound all the chopping and changing of the team beforehand – a common feature of Pupils# line-ups due to injuries and work commitments in recent weeks – the Kintyre side suffered a huge setback on the pitch after two minutes.A Finnart corner, for all the world a Pupils# goal kick, was awarded by the referee, and the visitors# near-post delivery was flicked on and erted into the net by a Finnart head at the back post.Although the award of the corner was thought to be unjust, the home side was left reflecting on a set piece which could have been defended much better.The McFadyens-sponsored Pupils gradually settled into the game after this early shock and enjoyed decent spells of possession,perhaps only resulting in half-chances at goal – notably through a Scott Souden header which went narrowly by the post – throughout a tightly-contested first half.After the interval, the Pupils continued to press for an equaliser, but their battle-hardened visitors, who have enjoyed the winning habit for most of this season so far, were well organised in defence, with experienced substitutes adding a calmness to their play.Nevertheless, working hard in search of an equaliser, the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils had a foray into the Finnart box midway through the second half when Stuart Crossan played in John McCallum with a deft flick, but the latter#s right-footed shot flashed wide of the Finnart goal.McCallum found space in the box again soon after and cut the ball back to Scott Souden, a little too far behind, but was bailed out by the onrushing Liam Renton, who looked to have the goal at his mercy, but somehow a Finnart defender got back to block the close-range effort.Meanwhile, Pupils captain Keith Mitchell had switched from a midfield berth to left back during the second half, and the change was bearing fruit with a good deal of the Pupils# play developing down this flank.However, more frustration was to follow for the home side in the rd minute, as the Pupils# defence was exposed in a two-vs-one situation and an unmarked Finnart forward latched on to a through-ball and lashed a shot beyond young Pupils #keeper Alasdair Ferguson to give the visitors an unassailable - lead with so little time remaining.It was a bitter blow for the home side having put so much effort into earning at least a point, but hopefully it can be taken as another lesson in game management from an experienced and well-drilled opponent.Tomorrow , the Pupils are on their travels, taking on Paisley outfit Glenvale FC on league duty at the town#s Ferguslie Park.

The woodland is a nature reserve currently managed by the Scottish Wildle Trust.The upper path takes you to Innerwick Castle. This path is narrow in places, although quite well trodden so easy to follow.But it is sided by a steep decline into the gorge that demands you take care when walking. The castle, built in the th century, is perched dramatically atop a sandstone outcrop looking over the glen. It is picturesque now but a crumbling ruin in such a precarious condition that itrsquos not recommended to venture inside.I wrote of its history on this page over seven years ago, and will touch on it again here, but the purpose of this visit was mainly to explore the gorge below the castle, which Irsquod never managed to do.Irsquoll give a warning here too: the lower path that takes you closer to the burn, although marked, doesnrsquot seem to be maintained and is in parts very muddy and slippery. It can become an adventure rather than a woodland walk. But thatrsquos what we wanted.We were immersed in native woodland as we descended, embraced by ash and oak trees. The burn ran with some confidence through the glen, carrying the rainfall of previous days. Touches of autumn were everywhere, yet the summer canopy was still intact. It was a perfect combination.As the path heads deeper up the glen, the trunk of a massive fallen tree make it an obstacle course, but also an opportunity to sit and just take in the beauty of the place and soak up the birdsong.In those moments, it was possible to forget that we were, in fact, in a landscape dominated by agriculture and open fields. The steep sides of the gorge hide the fact that the wood is just a very narrow strip. The eye is deceived, the imagination lit and the senses lted.I was determined to make it to the water. The short scramble down to the burn from the path was a drama of mud.I know, Irsquom not selling this place so well, am I, but it was the challenge to reach the burn that made it feel so remote and wild once we got there.Then one of my kids, in between complaining about muddy shoes, said something that lit up the day for me.ldquoWow, you know, it almost feels like we are in a world of fairytale make believe, you know because we are in a wood that feels like itrsquos mysterious and magical at the same time.She summed up my feelings as I sat by the burn, listening to the water tumble over the rocks.I really wanted to walk up the burn to the point below the castle.Wersquod earlier peered down at the burn from the base of the rock on which the castle is built at least a ft-fall, I reckoned.It was far too dangerous to descend at that point, although I had wanted to it was where a Scots soldier from the castle leapt for his le in  when the castle was besieged by English hakbutters, an early kind of musketeer.He was desperate his comrades had been picked off by the gunfire, so he took the chance to escape.Miraculously, he survived the initial fall and was allowed to run to safety. Sadly, he made the fatal decision to run upstream, towards Thornton Castle, where he was seen and shot by a dferent group of English soldiers who knew nothing of his daring feat.The incident was recorded by an English eyewitness, but we have no name for the man who met his end so tragically in this gorge ndash just another nameless victim of a brutal war that became known later as the lsquoRough Wooingrsquo.Later, the castle was used as a base by moss troopers in  in their attacks on Cromwellrsquos supply route, but thatrsquos another story.The melancholy of the glenrsquos history didnrsquot diminish its beauty for me and I made my way carefully along the burn, jumping from stone to stone, getting my boots muddy and soaked in the process. It really was a magical experience in which my inner child felt free.However, I had a dferent kind of gunfire to contend with as I ventured upstream. Irsquod insisted my kids stay in a safer place and my we Kate was happy to be with them and keep her feet dry. But the children showered me with a volley of distant shouts and yells that they wanted to come too, which I felt would have been too hazardous for the youngest.So I was compelled to abandon my exploration in case they broke ranks you see, they donrsquot always do as they are told, especially when their dad is doing something they want to experience as well!But I will I can find the time in the winter, with perhaps just one of the kids: my own inner child."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-cricketers-play-icc-mens-t20-world-cup-kit-designed-haddington-schoolgirl","story":"The ICC Menrsquos T World Cup gets under way in the United Arab Emirates and Oman this weekend.Scotland, who start their tournament against Bangladesh this Sunday, will be wearing a design created by Haddingtonrsquos Rebecca Downie.The youngsterrsquos pattern was chosen from more than  entries from schoolchildren across Scotland.

He was a morphine addict who destroyed his prospects as a doctor.ldquoHe used to have practices in Rotherfield, where he murdered Hubert, but he had to leave because he was so addicted to morphine.ldquoHe could not handle the practice anymore and moved to Bournemouth and became incapable of running his practice.Dr Bondeson, , is no stranger to writing about gruesome murders.Earlier this year, he told the story of a dozen unsolved murders in London, including that of prostitute Harriet Buswell, who was killed on Christmas Day.It was during the writing of that book, which was reissued this year, that he came across the story of Dr Lamson.Dr Bondeson said: ldquoBack in  or , I wrote a book called Victorian Murders about ious murders in Victorian times.ldquoDr Lamson was one of the cases and I was surprised how much new material could be found about him.ldquoThere had not been a modern study of him in the last  years and it seemed a good idea to remedy that and write a story of Dr Lamson using modern research, as well as files from the National Archives in Kew.Dr Lamson had been a military doctor before taking on the medical practice in Rotherfield, East Sussex.After he married, he gained two brothers-in-law: Hubert, who had tuberculosis, and Percy, who had scoliosis.In , during a family gathering, Hubert died suddenly, with his cause of death listed as pulmonary consumption and amyloid degeneration.Just two years later, Dr Lamson persuaded Percy to swallow a gelatine capsule, with forensic scientists later finding he had been poisoned with the uncommon vegetable toxin aconitine.Dr Lamson was later found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.Dr Bondeson said: ldquoDuring his criminous and wasted le, Dr Lamson had accomplished some good but also much wickedness short and evil had been his days, as he stood on the scaffold counting one or two more seconds, the longest-lasting in his le, waiting for the drop to open.ldquoThe police detectives, and even Lamsonrsquos barrister Montagu Williams, felt certain that Dr Lamson was a double murderer, having poisoned both his brothers-in-law for the sake of profit.ldquoComparing his murderous career with those of the prolic medical killers Palmer and Pritchard, it indeed seems likely that Dr Lamson murdered Hubert John as well and got away with it."},{"url":null,"title":"poets-dream-greener-planet-feature-climate-summit-glasgow","story":"The Rev Jock Steinrsquos poem The World I Want will be part of a unique virtual art exhibition ahead of

However, Scottish councils are not always enforcing these laws.Globally, it is estimated that % of all deaths are related to air pollution. with around , deaths each year in the UK attributable to air pollution, most of it from vehicular traffic. It has been linked to cancer, asthma, diabetes, and dementia.Two Scottish studies have shown signicant increases in hospital admissions on days of illegal pollution with new-onset heart disease, lung disease, and blood clots in the arteries of the legs , when compared to days when air pollution is within legal limits.Babies can be still-born or born prematurely, while children subjected to air pollution are more likely to die in their first two years, to attend AE with chest infections, and suffer from asthma.A Scottish study has shown that many more children are admitted to hospital on days of illegally high pollution.Scottish researchers have also shown that keeping air pollution within legal limits would reduce hospital admissions by %, a major reduction in ill-health which would save money for our NHS.It is estimated that air pollution costs the UK poundbn per annum in health and social care.We know that those who are already disadvantaged are disproportionately affected ndash often living in city centres or beside main roads.They have less access to less green space, which can absorb some of the noxious pollutants, and are the least able to afford a car, thus suffering the ill-effects without contributing to them.Addressing these issues is critical. We believe that immediate and medium-term action must now be taken including:* Implementing more low-emission zones within six months in all Air Quality Management Areas.* Installing more air pollution monitors, which should be obligatory on roads beside every school.* Removing speed bumps ndash as braking then accelerating is recognised as a source of excess fumes. These should be replaced by mph zones.* Making idling an offence, enforceable by traffic wardens able to issue tickets.* Preventing major roads going through new developments.In the medium term the Scottish Government should further support:* Active travel: We need protected cycle routes of the correct width that donrsquot end suddenly, increasing the risk of injury.* Better public transport: Investment in rail service will play a big part in reducing air pollution.* Investment in green space: Greening our roads will produce more pleasant streets and the correct planting will allow signicant decreases in air pollution.We are happy to discuss all of the above at your convenience.Jill Belch, Professor of Vascular Medicine NHS Tayside University of Dundee James Chalmers, Professor of Respiratory Medicine NHS Tayside University of Dundee Munro Stewart, GP NHS Tayside Sustainability Group Tom Fardon, Respiratory lead for the Scottish Access Collaborative at The Scottish Government.Plus  more health professionals including consultants, GPs and academics from across Scotland.INVESTMENT IN CLEAN TRANSPORTTHE Governmentrsquos newly-announced Net Zero strategy is a very welcome step towards a green future for the country.

He estimates that the equivalent of . trillion insects are killed by German onshore wind turbines annually. The indirect effect of this will be fewer insects for birds and bats to eat, and reduced pollination of plants.It seems we have to destroy the planet to save the planet.Geoff Moore, Alness.TWO VIEWS ON CARBON CAPTURETHE Tory Governmentrsquos spurning of the Aberdeenshire site for a carbon capture plant, despite promising it pre-referendum in , starkly illustrates why the Union is a disaster for Scotland.Boris Johnson knows he doesnrsquot need the six Scottish Tories to keep his majority, so has chosen the Humber and the Liverpool area instead to shore up Tories in the former Red Wall.Sir Ian Wood, chairman of the Energy Transition Zone, said the UKrsquos choice ldquomakes little economic or environmental sense and is a real blow to Scotland.Scotland, he added, ldquois the most cost-effective place to begin [carbon capture] in the UK given the capacity for CO transport and storage.ldquoVitally, there is also a huge opportunity for oil and gas firms, domestic supply chain companies and our wider economy to harness the skills of our current workforce to create many good, green jobs in the coming years and contribute signicantly to the net zero ambition.Scottish MPs in Westminster are being cut from  to , while English MPs will increase from  to . Scotland doesnrsquot stand a chance.What will it take for the Scottish Government to finally recall its MPs from Westminster and get on with the business of liberating Scotland from a Union that is slowly strangling us Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh.* THE SNP are very annoyed that Aberdeenshire has missed out on the Acorn carbon capture deal.ldquoIt is yet another betrayal of bringing jobs and infrastructure to Scotland by Westminster, it implies. But just a minute. Is the SNP policy of getting rid of the Faslane naval base at the earliest possible opportunity not just the same policy in reverse Surely the SNP would be forcing many jobs out of Scotland and into England with no credible replacements on offer. The SNP needs to be a bit more careful about protesting before thinking.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH TO BE FACEDCONGRATULATIONS to Iain Macwhirter for his article ldquoForget heat pumps, SNP is selling us a pig in a green pokewhich at last exposes the true costs of a Green Revolution.The Scottish economy cannot afford to meet the  targets without a massive collapse in our current standard of living.The major problem that Holyrood fails to address is that renewable energy is still over double the price of fossil fuels even when gas has increased to p therm.The SNP Green Alliance needs to focus on pushing the renewable sector to deliver electricity to the consumer at a cost of around p unit. Even the talk of using green or blue hydrogen as an energy source is pie-in-the-skyyou have to start the process using wind energy at p unit before including the downstream costs of splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen.The Inconvenient Truth is that should the BRIC countries fail to turn up in Glasgow then COP is dead in the water.Western nations will need to go back to the drawing board to find a method of competing with coal and gas powered stations in the BRIC community whilst solving the puzzle of capturing the excess CO in the air to reduce the current CO levels in the atmosphere by at least %Ian Moir, Castle Douglas.xxxDisappointingly I have just read what amounts to a mountain of disingenuous clap trap under your lsquoGateway to a New Age of Green Energyrsquo section of todayrsquos Herald .Mr Lewis McIntyre of Peel Ports tells us of the incredible transformation his organisation has made with regard to its green credentials. He extols the virtues of its Hunterston site in this regard. He tells us of the wonderful money spinning and job creating proposal to produce High Voltage sub sea cables which would continuously produce cabling to be wound aboard awaiting ships alongside the old coal jetty.Ask the residents of Fairlie what a   environmental noise nuisance was created when a similar vessel lay alongside during the Hunterston to North Wales sub sea HVDC cable laying project. That is in addition to the noise excesses over decades incurred from coal shipments being offloaded at the jetty.Would this be the same organisation which has polluted the air in the Fairlie Largs area for decades with a huge burden of airborne coal dust, despite repeated remonstration from Fairlie Community Council and many others Is this the same organisation which hosted two of the worlds biggest oil well drill exploration for the last  months  The said ships have continuously spewed hundreds of thousands of Megawatt hours worth of diesel exhaust fumes to the local environment when they could and most emphatically should have been supplied with green, shore supplied electrical energy  The power supply block at the end of the jetty could easily have been adapted to supply these ships. Some expenditure would have been incurred slightly offsetting the huge daily berthing fees charged for DS and DS. Good timing in that one of these vessels has just departed pre COP . A visiting COP  team would have been horried.My personal view of this highly aicious organisation is that it has not been a good community neighbour and will exploit any opportunity irrespective of environmental soundness. Mr McIntyre stresses the need to redress the East West coast of Scotland imbalance when it comes to oil related matters.This was demonstrated when oil rig decommissioning was included as part of the proposed agenda. They would have been happy to endanger the local SSSI during the necessary dredging operations required to fit a dock gate to the oil rig construction yard, without consideration of an Environmental Impact Assessment.Three cheers for Marine Scotland and Friends of Firth of Clyde who interrupted this aicious, potentially environmentally disastrous project, whereby acres of sea grass stood to be eliminated.Sadly our MSP, who supported the project, stood up in Holyrood and asserted thatthe developers caused environmental damage then some of the pound million of taxpayers money allocated to the project would be clawed back. Stable, door, horse, bolted, are words which most immediately spring to mind.Clearly much recalibration of thought processes is required. Shame on Mr McIntyrersquos organisation. I rest my case.Hugh Maclean, Fairliexxx.xxxxIn his piece about opinions and news, Mark Smith seems to have missed the point that The Herald is, first and foremost, a lsquoNewspaperrsquo ndash it is right there within the banner title. It is not an opinion magazine, nor is it an entertainment magazine.Being allowed to have an Opinion Piece is a privilege and should be seen as such, and that seems to be lost on those offering lsquoOpinionsrsquo many of which are less about being informative and more about being inflammatory. Mr. Smithrsquos offering was less about defining lsquonewsrsquo and lsquoopinionrsquo and more about some beef he has with the SNP President.As for his comments defending the BBC, well that news medium has long since lost its right to be regarded as a reliable source of balanced views.Gone are the days of investigative in-depth journalism and follow up stories on things that matter. With COP  coming to town, I wonder how long The Herald will highlight Environmental stories after the circus has left town.Nevertheless, using just two examples of forgotten news: in the past there would have been many follow up articles about womenrsquos pension scandals, and, during an energy crisis, news media would cover the story daily until it was resolved. The latter barely merited three days in spite of it being an ongoing crisis.But The Herald unashamedly allows party politics into its columns under the guise of lsquoOpinion Piecesrsquo from people who failed at being politicians. I would like to see much less of the lsquothe in-depth opinion piecesrsquo and much more old fashioned reporting ndash Herald Letters Pages offer enough opinion for us all.As for Mr. Smithrsquos assertion that people who read the Herald are looking for opinions that agree with their own ndash well he has missed the mark with that one. I rarely agree with the Opinions on offerbut I still enjoy reading the reported news ndash DAILY!Francis Deigman, Erskine"},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive accessas we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive pound for two months offer here.From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expectground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content ndash as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just pound for two monthshere.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as ldquounsatisfactory on pollution, according to data from the ScottishEnvironmentProtection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oilcompanies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as ldquovery poor in .

The vessel design is broadly based on our larger loch class vessels, which are double-ended.“Once the designs are approved, we will move to the next stage of the project, which will see the build of the engine to be used in feasibility studies.“The maritime industry has a key role in the global fight for climate change, and this project marks a step toward emissions-free marine transport.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

An advance team is already thought to have been in place in Northern Ireland planning for the visit.Read MoreQueen cancels trip to NI after being advised to rest for ‘next few days’The cancellation is not Covid-related and it is not known what are the health issues that forced her to make this concession, which is likely to mark the start of a more considered period of public appearances after a busy time for the monarch.The spokesperson said the event would go ahead as planned but no other member of the Royal Family would attend in Her Majesty’s place and alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson.The planned event has been fraught with political dficulty after Irish President Michael D Higgins last month declined an invitation from the Church Leaders Group.

They continued: “We hope that tomorrow’s service will provide an opportunity to further that work, with an emphasis on our shared hopes for the future.”The Queen is in good spirits but disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland, the palace said. A spokesperson added: The Queen sends her warmest good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland and looks forward to visiting in the future. The monarch is, however, still expected to attend the COP climate change conference in Glasgow later this month.DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: We thank Her Majesty for her good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland and trust that she will keep well and benefit from a period of rest.It is always a joy to have Her Majesty in Royal Hillsborough and we look forward to a further visit in the near future.Wishing the Queen well, Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie said the monarch had been a source of great comfort during Northern Ireland#s darkest days and provided lasting leadership as we moved into a new era for all our people.Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he wished the Queen all the very best as she takes a few days# rest.The Queen, the nation#s longest-reigning monarch, attended a series of events in recent days, hosting a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle, where she is currently resting.It was revealed on Tuesday the monarch had declined the Oldie of the Year award proffered from the magazine of the same name.

Currently,  of the current constituencies fall outside this range.As the existing constituencies were established in , but the current local government boundaries are more recent, from , these wards have been used as ‘building blocks’ by the Commission in setting out the changes.The full list of the proposed changes can be found on the Boundary Commission website.Professor Tonge said: “The previous threat of cutting a parliamentary seat from Northern Ireland is clearly over.“A radical change would have cut the Belfast seats, but that would have caused uproar. You could argue it’s the local government tail wagging the parliamentary constituency dog, as it is very focused on placing as many wards as possible within single constituencies to avoid splitting — understandable I suppose, but I doubt the electorate really cares that much.“A very early reading is that Fermanagh and South Tyrone — very marginal — becomes fractionally more nationalist, which will please Sinn Fein the renamed Belfast South becomes a shade more unionist, but not enough to give the SDLP’s Claire Hanna sleepless nights Foyle becomes a bit more nationalist and East Londonderry a bit more unionist. If there is a pattern overall, it’s a very marginal deepening of the green and orange areas — nationalist areas consolidated in particular, but some unionist seats as well.”Deputy chairman of the Commission, Mr Justice Michael Humphreys, said: “The Commission is keen to encourage everyone with an interest to share their views by engaging with the consultation process, whether it is to support the proposals or to suggest alternatives which also take into account the requirements of the legislation.”The proposals will now go out for consultation and public hearing before final recommendations are made by July , .Related topicsSinn FéinSDLPUlster Unionist PartyAlliance PartyMost ReadJake Bailey-Sloan’s heartbroken partner ‘in a million pieces after death of the love of my le’Buckingham Palace won’t send another member of Royal Family to centenary church serviceAlban MaginnessOpinionUnionist ‘cunning plan’ a trick to cheat Sinn Fein out of top jobPolice raid Mid and East Antrim council offices, leaving local councillors ‘shocked’New proposals could see parliamentary constituency shake-up, with two renamed completelyTop VideosPlayQueen cancels Northern Ireland trip after being told by doctors to restPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedPlayVideo: Fire Fighters battle major blaze in Antrim Latest Northern IrelandChurch service in Armagh to mark Northern Ireland centenaryUtility regulator says hands are tied over rising gas pricesBuckingham Palace won’t send another member of Royal Family to Partition centenary service after Queen pulls outPolice search Mid and East Antrim council officesSinn Fein claims NI destinations excluded from Irish tourism initiativesLatestChurch service in Armagh to mark Northern Ireland centenaryGabby Petito case: Police seeking Brian Laundrie find potential human remainsOle Gunnar Solskjaer delighted as Cristiano Ronaldo seals comeback over AtalantaPaul Scholes not getting carried away after Man Utd battle back for victoryCall for winter fuel payments to be given to low income families as energy prices spiral,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is absolutely crucial people support those businesses as that is what the voucher is all about.”Colin Neill from Hospitality Ulster added: “Look, we all have to accept there are people maybe less fortunate than you and I, that this £ puts food in their cupboard.“But I think there is a huge dference between someone going and buying groceries in one of our supermarkets to feed their kids and using it for an Amazon voucher.“I think at this point we should be appealing to them [the supermarkets] and they should come out and make a statement and say they should no longer accept [the card] for that type of purchase.”During the show a number of callers admitted they would be using the Spend Local card to purchase vouchers for the online retail giant.One man called Graham told the show: “When I get my money, I am going to nip down and buy a voucher and I am going to spend it on Amazon.I am going to buy on Amazon something I can get for maybe half the price I can buy through my local retailer.”While the cards cannot be used online or for gambling or legal services like penalties, according to the Department for the Economy there is no technical way to prevent online gt vouchers being purchased in a store.They said the “limits of the technology” mean it is “not possible to distinguish between items within someone’s shopping basket”.In a statement from a department spokesperson, they instead encouraged the public to think of the local retailers who have been impacted by the pandemic and said an advertising campaign is designed to encourage this.“The High Street Scheme is designed to stimulate demand in local businesses, including retail and hospitality sectors, following the pandemic,” they said.“However, the scheme has also been designed to be as simple to use as possible in order to allow the public to spend their £ pre-paid card in local businesses.“It was set up so that businesses in Northern Ireland that can accept a debit or credit card as payment for goods or services they sell, can also accept the Spend Local cards as payment.“While it is possible to purchase some goods which will have less benefit to our local businesses, the Department would discourage this.”They added: “Indeed, the Department has been clear in its messaging to all card holders – use your Spend Local card to help those retail, hospitality and other sectors in your local area that have been most impacted by the pandemic.“This message has been embraced by many of our local business owners who are encouraging card holders to spend a little to give a big effect. We encourage Nolan Show listeners to do the same.”Most ReadJake Bailey-Sloan’s heartbroken partner ‘in a million pieces after death of the love of my le’Buckingham Palace won’t send another member of Royal Family to centenary church serviceAlban MaginnessOpinionUnionist ‘cunning plan’ a trick to cheat Sinn Fein out of top jobPolice raid Mid and East Antrim council offices, leaving local councillors ‘shocked’New proposals could see parliamentary constituency shake-up, with two renamed completelyTop VideosPlayQueen cancels Northern Ireland trip after being told by doctors to restPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedPlayVideo: Fire Fighters battle major blaze in Antrim Latest Northern IrelandChurch service in Armagh to mark Northern Ireland centenaryLocal parties mull over proposals for a shake-up of parliamentary boundariesUtility regulator says hands are tied over rising gas pricesBuckingham Palace won’t send another member of Royal Family to Partition centenary service after Queen pulls outPolice search Mid and East Antrim council officesLatestWhat the papers say – October Church service in Armagh to mark Northern Ireland centenaryGabby Petito case: Police seeking Brian Laundrie find potential human remainsOle Gunnar Solskjaer delighted as Cristiano Ronaldo seals comeback over AtalantaPaul Scholes not getting carried away after Man Utd battle back for victory,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No one wants ato the draconian measures that have been in place for so long.The Executive has identied a robust and dynamic communication strategy as key in achieving this. Time will tellit can stay on message.Most ReadJake Bailey-Sloan’s heartbroken partner ‘in a million pieces after death of the love of my le’Buckingham Palace won’t send another member of Royal Family to centenary church serviceAlban MaginnessOpinionUnionist ‘cunning plan’ a trick to cheat Sinn Fein out of top jobPolice raid Mid and East Antrim council offices, leaving local councillors ‘shocked’New proposals could see parliamentary constituency shake-up, with two renamed completelyTop VideosPlayQueen cancels Northern Ireland trip after being told by doctors to restPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedPlayVideo: Fire Fighters battle major blaze in Antrim Latest Northern IrelandChurch service in Armagh to mark Northern Ireland centenaryLocal parties mull over proposals for a shake-up of parliamentary boundariesUtility regulator says hands are tied over rising gas pricesBuckingham Palace won’t send another member of Royal Family to Partition centenary service after Queen pulls outPolice search Mid and East Antrim council officesLatestChurch service in Armagh to mark Northern Ireland centenaryGabby Petito case: Police seeking Brian Laundrie find potential human remainsOle Gunnar Solskjaer delighted as Cristiano Ronaldo seals comeback over AtalantaPaul Scholes not getting carried away after Man Utd battle back for victoryCall for winter fuel payments to be given to low income families as energy prices spiral,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: Martin McKeown.Reporter: Staff Reporter Oct   addthis, Claudy para-triathletes Chloe and Judith MacCombe have put themselves in pole position for a place in the Northern Ireland team for the Commonwealth Games after claiming first and second place at the national championships in Limerick. Chloe’s gold medal finish and her twin sister Judith’s runner up spot was a reverse of the result at the same competition in Drogheda pre lockdown in . googletag.cmd.push It leaves them in eighth and tenth place respectively in the Commonwealth Games rankings where the top ten will qualy for the games in Birmingham next summer. They have been working daily towards their goal at the Foyle Arena where Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Athlete Support Membership Scheme gives them free access to Council leisure facilities. The -year-olds are former students at Limavady Grammar and were diagnosed at birth with a form of albinism that means their sight is around one third of what someone with   vision would experience. They have barely spent a day apart in those  years and both studied geography at Ulster University in Coleraine during which time a chance meeting with Irish triathlon high performance coach Eamon Tilley guided them towards the gruelling discipline.     “We weren’t overly sporty growing up,” Chloe recalled. “We got involved in rugby and rowing at Coleraine and were talent spotted by the Irish para rowing team and while we were there Eamon Tilley suggested we try the triathlon. “We started going to training days in  and we took part in our first race in , we didn’t perform that well but enjoyed the challenge of pushing ourselves so we did a few more events and started to improve.” The big breakthrough for the girls came in  when Judith claimed first and Chloe second place at the National Paratriathlon Championships at Pulse Port Beach in Drogheda, it looked to be the start of an exciting period but the Covid  pandemic led to an end to all competition in . “It was a big challenge to keep the momentum of our training going during lockdown,” said Judith. “We had been coming to the Foyle Arena  or  times a week so to lose access was a big blow. “We have an intimate knowledge of the back roads of Claudy from all the cycling and running we did while the centre was closed, it has been great to get access back, particularly in the pool which has now been ided up for dferent swimming speeds.” “Limerick was our first major event after lockdown so we weren’t sure how it would go,” Chloe added. “I am stronger on the bike but I knew Judith would make up ground on me on the run so I had to make sure I had a lead. “The membership scheme has had a massive impact on our success, training for a triathlon is very expensive and we don’t get any funding so it has been a real leline. “The facilities at the Foyle Arena are world class and the staff and coaches here have been very accommodating and taken a genuine interest in our journey. “To compete at the Commonwealth Games alongside my sister would be a dream come true and that goal drives us each day to train harder and get faster.” Opportunities The Athlete Support Membership Scheme aims to provide talented local athletes involved in an amateur sport with the best possible opportunities to develop and prepare for competition. Applicants must be currently part of a recognised gover​ning body, talent pathway or be officially representing their sport at county level or higher. Applicants who fulfil the criteria will be entitled to six months free access to gym, health suite and swimming pool facilities, they must be involved in an amateur sport which is recognised by either Sport Northern Ireland or the Irish Sports Council. Sports coordinator at Derry City and Strabane District Council, Keith Thompson, said: “World level athletes need world class facilities to compete at the highest level and we are delighted to be able to support a number of elite athletes at the Foyle Arena through free membership. “The team at the Foyle Arena are delighted for them and we are pleased to have played a role in their success.” To apply for the Athlete Support Membership scheme e mail Keith at keith.thompson@ derrystrabane.

Photo: Martin McKeown.Reporter: Staff Reporter Oct   addthis, Claudy para-triathletes Chloe and Judith MacCombe have put themselves in pole position for a place in the Northern Ireland team for the Commonwealth Games after claiming first and second place at the national championships in Limerick. Chloe’s gold medal finish and her twin sister Judith’s runner up spot was a reverse of the result at the same competition in Drogheda pre lockdown in . googletag.cmd.push It leaves them in eighth and tenth place respectively in the Commonwealth Games rankings where the top ten will qualy for the games in Birmingham next summer. They have been working daily towards their goal at the Foyle Arena where Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Athlete Support Membership Scheme gives them free access to Council leisure facilities. The -year-olds are former students at Limavady Grammar and were diagnosed at birth with a form of albinism that means their sight is around one third of what someone with   vision would experience. They have barely spent a day apart in those  years and both studied geography at Ulster University in Coleraine during which time a chance meeting with Irish triathlon high performance coach Eamon Tilley guided them towards the gruelling discipline.     “We weren’t overly sporty growing up,” Chloe recalled. “We got involved in rugby and rowing at Coleraine and were talent spotted by the Irish para rowing team and while we were there Eamon Tilley suggested we try the triathlon. “We started going to training days in  and we took part in our first race in , we didn’t perform that well but enjoyed the challenge of pushing ourselves so we did a few more events and started to improve.” The big breakthrough for the girls came in  when Judith claimed first and Chloe second place at the National Paratriathlon Championships at Pulse Port Beach in Drogheda, it looked to be the start of an exciting period but the Covid  pandemic led to an end to all competition in . “It was a big challenge to keep the momentum of our training going during lockdown,” said Judith. “We had been coming to the Foyle Arena  or  times a week so to lose access was a big blow. “We have an intimate knowledge of the back roads of Claudy from all the cycling and running we did while the centre was closed, it has been great to get access back, particularly in the pool which has now been ided up for dferent swimming speeds.” “Limerick was our first major event after lockdown so we weren’t sure how it would go,” Chloe added. “I am stronger on the bike but I knew Judith would make up ground on me on the run so I had to make sure I had a lead. “The membership scheme has had a massive impact on our success, training for a triathlon is very expensive and we don’t get any funding so it has been a real leline. “The facilities at the Foyle Arena are world class and the staff and coaches here have been very accommodating and taken a genuine interest in our journey. “To compete at the Commonwealth Games alongside my sister would be a dream come true and that goal drives us each day to train harder and get faster.” Opportunities The Athlete Support Membership Scheme aims to provide talented local athletes involved in an amateur sport with the best possible opportunities to develop and prepare for competition. Applicants must be currently part of a recognised gover​ning body, talent pathway or be officially representing their sport at county level or higher. Applicants who fulfil the criteria will be entitled to six months free access to gym, health suite and swimming pool facilities, they must be involved in an amateur sport which is recognised by either Sport Northern Ireland or the Irish Sports Council. Sports coordinator at Derry City and Strabane District Council, Keith Thompson, said: “World level athletes need world class facilities to compete at the highest level and we are delighted to be able to support a number of elite athletes at the Foyle Arena through free membership. “The team at the Foyle Arena are delighted for them and we are pleased to have played a role in their success.” To apply for the Athlete Support Membership scheme e mail Keith at keith.thompson@ derrystrabane.

An official date is expected to be announced for the resumption of transatlantic flights from Ireland and other countries to the US in the coming days but Aer Lingus have already confirmed a date for theirto transatlantic flights. googletag.cmd.push In what could be an indicator of the official date, passengers can book tickets to Newark from Dublin from as early as November  following confirmation by the airline. Aer Lingus transatlantic flights resume from Dublin to Newark from November  and Orlando from November , a statement read. Irish customers ready to travel US-bound once the travel ban is lted in November, can once again fly direct from Dublin to Newark and Orlando from November, it continued. The US announced last month that it would lt the strict air travel ban imposed on non-US citizens travelling to the country in early November.     Expectation is mounting with an announcement possible before the weekend on the official date. The US has this week also announced the lting of travel restrictions with Canada and Mexico across its land borders for the same time in early November. Irish travellers will be eagerly awaiting official word to book flights to visit the likes of New York during the Christmas period but they will still be expected to adhere to some restrictions. Before travelling, Aer Lingus customers are advised to use the airline’s newonline travel support toolto search by destination and retrieve up-to-date tailored travel information based on their specic circumstances including vaccination status,travel and flight connection requirements. Should plans change, customers can also avail of the ‘Book with Confidence’ flexible booking proposition until  December , a spokesperson said.

It comes as part of the Northern Irelands Executives winter Covid contingency plans. The Executive said there was a need to keep as many sectors open to the fullest possible extent. First Minister, Paul Givan said doing that would depend on as many people as possible getting vaccinated.” googletag.cmd.push Just over % of people aged  and above in Northern Ireland had received one dose of the vaccine. Mr Givan said: Our vaccination rates are very good but there is still room for improvement.” Further Covid restrictions are due to be relaxed by the Executive onOctober . This will allow for nightclubs to reopen, restrictions on indoor dancing lted and the requirement to be seated in hospitality to drink and eat food will no longer be in place. Mr Givan said it was a fact of le that Covid remains an ongoing issue, and that the Executive needed to continue to find ways to manage the situation.     The First Minister says that the Executive will launch a new public information campaign before the end of October to build on the need for all of us to keep making safer choices. He also said that there would be a focus on “flexible and hybrid working” in workplaces. Mr Givan set out a range of optionsCovid cases rise drastically or hospital pressures become “unsustainable” with the possibility of deploying Covid vaccine passports in high-risk settings, “ considered appropriate.” The Department of Health at Stormont is also working on a systemthis situation arises that would see the strengthening of self-isolation rules for close contacts of those who contract the virus and a re-imposition in law of social distancing in certain settings. He continued: The efforts that have been made by so many in recent months to drive up vaccination rates and step-up compliance with mitigations do seem to be working. It is vital that we dont let up. We must maintain our focus and collective endeavour.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm.     When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsFormer County Derry bank building goes on rental market overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMurdered County Derry man was victim of alleged assault last year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police in Derry appeal for anyone who believes they have had their drink spiked last weekend to contact themDerry NewsPolice appealing for anyone who believes they had their drink spiked while out in Derry city-centre last weekend to contact them overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy.     “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsFormer County Derry bank building goes on rental market overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMurdered County Derry man was victim of alleged assault last year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police in Derry appeal for anyone who believes they have had their drink spiked last weekend to contact themDerry NewsPolice appealing for anyone who believes they had their drink spiked while out in Derry city-centre last weekend to contact them overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

On Friday evening, DfI announced that advice issued around the development of farm and in-fill dwellings had been withdrawn after what they described as a signicant response. googletag.cmd.push “The PAN did not add to or change existing planning policy,” said a spokesperson. “The Department had not expected such a signicant response to what is essentially an advice note to support the efficient and effective workings of the two-tier planning system. “Regrettably, rather than bringing certainty and clarity, as was its intention, the PAN seems to have created confusion and uncertainty.  DfI Minister Nichola Mallon “The Department has listened carefully to and reflected on all the concerns and has decided to withdraw the PAN today to swtly restore clarity to this situation. “The Department will now take stock of the concerns raised and undertake further engagement and analysis on this important policy area, to include consideration of current and emerging issues, such as the climate emergency and a green recovery from this pandemic.”     Issues around the planning notice had been first raised in August by Mid Ulster councillor Sean McPeake, with a number of planners also contacting the County Derry Post to raise their concerns. Mid Ulster District Council also wrote an official letter to DfI calling for the advice to be withdrawn, as neighbouring councils also voiced their frustration with the notice. Cllr Sean McPeake Cllr McPeake welcomed the withdrawal of the Department advice, branding it a harmful diktat that should have not been introduced without consultation and agreement. “This PAN was clearly imposing additional signicant planning restrictions across a number of planning policy areas,” said the Sinn Feacutein representative. “Despite packaging the note as ‘Guidance’ Councils were left with no option but to take into account the new restrictions within the PAN when determining on rural planning applications. “These were policy changes as they were directing Councils to refuse planning applications which did not meet their new restrictive directives within ‘dwellings on farms’, infill development and clustering. “Since August   Planning departments within Councils were having to change initial opinions to applications already within the planning system on many applications from approvals to refusals. “Since the devolution of planning powers to Councils in , they have been successfully working within the parameters of the policies devolved to them from Stormont. “The outworking of the recent PAN was to make an already restricted policy even more restricted with additional caveats requiring to be overcome before planning approval would be granted. “Ministers in government and their governmental departments need to listen carefully to the needs of rural people and their communities and tailor rural sustainability policies to suit.” Emma Sheerin MLA A Sinn Feacutein motion and debate was due to be tabled in Stormont today, and Mid Ulster MLA Emma Sheerin said she was delighted it was no longer necessary. “We had tabled a motion that was due to be moving today,” she said. “I had submitted several questions to the Minister about this and am delighted that she has responded to the pressure and rescinded this advice which would have ruled out many peoples homes.” Fellow Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone also welcomed the withdrawal of the advice on Friday. “While the intention of the advice note was to help to bring certainty and clarity for councils, unfortunately the PAN seems to have created confusion and uncertainty,” said the SDLP representative. “I welcome that the Minister has listened to the concerns raised, especially in the rural communities and by our rural representatives, and has instructed the Department to withdraw the PAN. “It is right that the Minister and the Department have committed to further engagement including consideration of issues related to the climate crisis and a green recovery from this pandemic as we seek to support our rural communities across the North.” Chris Cassidy Chris Cassidy, of CMI Planners  Architecture Ltd, said the decision marks a victory for country dwellers. “Im obviously delighted that this PAN has been withdrawn. The issuing of this document was clearly a change of Planning Policy and quite rightly required consultation with interested bodies,” he said. “Its withdrawal will once again let Council members have the final say on applications based on policy and local knowledge. “The effort put in by elected representatives and agents is a victory for every person wanting to remain in the country side and were very proud to have played a small part in its removal.”  County Derry planning concerns raised at Assembly  Mid Ulster MLA Emma Sheerin has raised the matter in Stormont.

Castlerock footbridge is the subject of a ,-year lease to Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, entered into by the legacy Coleraine Borough Council in . googletag.cmd.push The bridge was removed in  to assess whether or not it could be restored and to investigate costs for any work required. Councillors recently raised concerns that the bridge was now sitting exposed to the elements, with Cllr Adrian McQuillan previously describing it as a big rusty mess. Now a report to the Environmental Services Committee has revealed further analysis on the bridge will take between  and  weeks. “Mann Williams Consultants have issued costs to complete the additional analysis necessary to satisfy the requirements of Translink and Council that the bridge is safe to re-install,” said the report.     “This work will commence shortly and is estimated to take - weeks. Council and Translink have agreed to meet monthly to keep abreast of progress.” An exasperated Cllr Richard Holmes asked a council officialTranslink would ever be satisfied the bridge could be safely re-installed. “The report is  or  weeks away, which seems an awful long time given how long weve already sat doing inspections on this,” said the UUP representative. “There is a chance that Translink are going to throw up obstacle after obstacle and we could be sitting here in ten years time with just a few elements of rust being left. “The bridge stood there for years, and local engineering firms took it out, fixed it and left it back previously. We didnt have to go through this amount of work. “Is it a case that no matter how many reports we do, somebody at Translink is quite happy for this bridge never to be put back in place ” Council official Aidan McPeake said there were design standards that had to be met. “Translink must be satisfied the bridge meets them,” he said. “Having done the initial analysis, it doesnt meet that, so were having to do these further finite element analysis on it. “If after this, it still doesnt pass, Translink wont let it back in. Thats the bottom line.” “It could be in Garvagh museum yet,” responded Cllr Holmes.  pound, spent allowing County Derry footbridge to become a big rusty mess  Cllr Adrian McQuillan has vowed to keep the issue on the Council agenda.

Cahore Playing Fields in Draperstown is currently home to Draperstown Celtic Football Club, who requested that Mid Ulster District Council upgrade the facilities back in February . googletag.cmd.push The proposal was approved at last weeks Development Committee, with plans to move forward with a sub-leasing arrangement also given the go-ahead. Local company Heron Bros currently lease the land directly to the Council, with the lease ied in  to a term of  years, backdated to April  . After public expressions of interest were sought in September, submissions for the two soccer pitches and one GAA pitch were received from Draperstown Celtic FC and St Colms GAC Ballinascreen. A site map of the location in Draperstown showing the pitches. Both clubs have indicated acceptance of LPS rent valuations for the site, with the soccer pitches to be rented at pound, per year and the GAA pitch at pound, per year.     Council will retain control of the sites pavilion under the arrangement due to the muli-sport nature of the facility, with clubs paying pound each in a keyholding arrangement. An initial survey carried out by a local contractor has indicated a cost of around pound, to upgrade the facilities, with the GAA pitch and one soccer pitch experiencing poor drainage. The report indicated the upgrade would focus on the GAA pitch, with the security provided by the lease allowing Draperstown Celtic to apply for funding to develop a G pitch in place of one soccer pitch. Councillor for the area, Catherine Elattar, said improvements at the site were overdue. “This seems to be a sensible approach. Money does need to be spent bringing the pitches up to standard,” said the Sinn Feacutein representative. “The leasing arrangement will allow the cost of this to be recouped in a relatively short period by Council. “It also allows local clubs to take over responsibility for the pitches, which will benefit the local community, as these clubs do an awful lot of important work in the area. Catherine Elattar spoke in favour of approval. Cllr Water Cuddy said he would not be voting against the proposal, but told the Committee it did seem very complicated. “Ive just cant understand why we dont step out and let the two clubs talk to the landowner,” he said. “Any public organisation needs to have policies in place and follow those through, becausewe start stepping outside policies, it gets very dficult. “We need to keep this as tidy as possible. Can we not just sign this over to the clubs without the spend so they can draw down the funding themselves  “Theyre getting pound, of grant aid through the back door almost. We need to keep things clear and transparent. “Its great to see it being delivered, and Im not against the project, but it just seems so complicated.” Cllr Cuddys UUP colleague, Cllr Trevor Wilson raised questions over how quickly the process had been undertaken. “My concern is that this was brought before us in February and we now have a report sitting [proposing] to go ahead with this,” he said. “I brought a report last year on another sporting facility and it has never reached this table. It makes you wonder. Ill just leave it at that.” Draperstown Celtic will join St Colms GAC Ballinascreen at the facility. Cllr Elattar said she was glad to hear Cllr Cuddy would not vote against the proposal. “These pitches in Cahore are not fit for purpose. If you come up to see them, you could be up to your knees in water,” she said. “The soccer team has to travel sometimes to Dungiven to play matches because they cant actually use the pitches. “The money needs to be spent whether or not the lease goes ahead. The lease gives the clubs ownership and lets them apply for outside funding that will add to what these pitches offer.”  County Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home  The -year-old has been disqualied from driving.    Mickey left memories that will be cherished forever  The Ballinascreen man passed away last week.    Empty Rural College site could provide interim asylum accommodation, says MLA  The Alliance representative said she was astounded the building was still empty.

When Ann decided four years ago to take on a new challenge in the form of running, she knew Claire would be her biggest supporter. googletag.cmd.push You see, Claire is no stranger to running, having undertaken almost  marathons to date, including ultras and  hour running events, she was only too happy to share her experience with herolder sister. The twins celebrate their achievements. But that Sunday morning Ann would have to step out in The Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon without Claire by her side.. and it seems Claire was more nervous than Ann about that. Ann, who lives inMagherasaid: “I only started running in  when we lost our youngest sister, Julie. I was , about to turn  later that year. Swatragh playgroup ran a CK and I joined in with that, that led on to me wanting to run more.     “Claire has been the biggest inspiration, she was always giving me words of advice, evenshe didnt realise she was doing it.” So as Ann built up her miles, and their thbirthday approached, the twins planned a trip to celebrate. But this wouldnt be a holiday where they needed flip-flops, the pair of them packed their running shoes and Ann ran her very first half marathon on the morning of their birthday, in sunny Benidorm with proud twin sister Claire by her side. Claire pictured in London. Claire, who is a member of Ballymena Runners said: “We have done lots of firsts together. Anns first k was with me in Ballymena and we did the half marathon at .am on the morning of our birthday – that was an unofficial one, but I was also there when Ann undertook her first official one. That was in Derry, I was her pacer and she was the only person in the group to stay with me the entire way. “I will never forget it, over the Foyle bridge Ann was right on my heels, I was immensely proud that day.” So how come on Sunday, October  the sisters ended up running in dferent places  Claire, a Learning Support Assistant at St Patricks College Ballymena, explained: “I had every intention of running Belfast, I wanted to be there for Anns very first marathon, but I had got through to run London in  and a stress fracture ruled me out, so when I had the chance this time I was so happy to do it, and it honestly didnt disappoint.” Ann, who works in Crawfords in Maghera, said: “At the beginning I had little motivation running solo, so I started doing social runs with other people close to home, as well as track training. I train with Rosemary Hargan but I belong to Termoneeny running Club.” And when Ann decided she was entering the Belfast Marathon, Claire was only too happy to be her training partner. Ann said: “Claire did a good few training runs with me, she gave me lots of advice, but above all was to smile and enjoy every step which is exactly what I did. I wasnt nervous until I saw the starting line, then I got a message from Claire and knew she was thinking of me, it really relaxed me knowing she was rooting for me! With my phone in my pocket, it was like she was with me. “Its never about the times, I just wanted to finish the marathon. I had hit  miles at four hours and looked at my watch, wonderingClaire had finished yet.” Ann pictured after taking on the Belfast Marathon. Claire added: “I probably overloaded Ann with advice, but she is so laidback I worried she hadnt realised the mammoth task involved in training for a marathon. “Ann and I both have our set days for training and we dont sway too much from them, but we never ever miss the long runs. “We did a good few of them together, Id either go toMagheraor Ann would drive to Cloughmills, wed run  –  miles, but when we didnt run together Ann would tell me what she was doing and Id be messaging her to see how she got on. “On the morning of the marathon I messaged her from the start line, I genuinely couldnt feel any more proud. I was more worried about Ann than myself, I worried that shed get caught up in the crowds and have a struggle to finish. “When I crossed the line myself I phoned my husband, Damien, and he was in Belfast waiting on Ann coming in. I was so happy to know she had the support of him and her whole family, she knew I was there in spirit.” Ann concluded: “I felt so happy running myself and knowing Claire was fulfilling one of her dreams to run in the London marathon. “We have enjoyed so many runs together and I know we will enjoy many more – another marathon is definitely on the cards for me, so hopefully we can both be in the same place for it!” So what advice do the girls give to any budding runners  Or anyone that may think theyre too old to start running  Ann said: “I was nearly  when I started running, Id say do it for YOU, keep turning up, commit to your own training, dont compare yourself to another runner, everyone runs for dferent reasons – headspace, beating their own personal times, but my advice is to show up and do it for you.” Claire, who is also a Leader in Running Fitness at Ballymena Runners, added: “The best advice Id give anyone is to trust your training. The longer runs make you stronger as they build a resilience youll need in a marathon. Consistency is key, as is good nutrition, thats fuel for your body.” So as the two sisters recover and plan their next long run they both want to thank friends who offered support and encouragment to them both during their training, their running clubs and their families, who are all very proud of them both and think theyre an inspiration.

The two smaller events which instigated numerous social distancing protocols combined to create the largest gathering of tents at a music festival anywhere in Ireland in  and with that experience under their belts, the team behind the multi-award-winning event have decided that the best way to try and get back to normality is to press forward with one larger event for approximately , people. googletag.cmd.push Festival Director Ross Parkhill explained: “Despite the dficulties, the uncertainties and all the additional rules and regulations we had to impose, both events in  went off really well and people really worked incredibly well with us in order to ensure that was the case. “Running two events provided big challenges for us but happily, as always, our amazing team rose to the occasion twice and more people camped at a music festival at Stendhal than anywhere  on the Island of Ireland this year, something we can really be proud of.” Ross continued: “Going forward though, to continue with the model of two smaller events would not be practical for us and we are confident that people are a bit more confident themselves now about ing to large scale outdoor gigs, as witnessed at a number of events in Belfast throughout September.     “With that in mind, with the eradication of social distancing rules for outdoor spaces and with plenty of lessons learned from our events in , we are confident that we canto our usual event set up in  and safely welcome over , patrons to the farm once again.” Super Saver Early bird tickets for Stendhal  will be on sale on October thth at pm and will be available until January th, when the organisers are hoping to make their first batch of line-up announcements. “By moving the event forward by about  weeks we have to hit the ground running,” added Ross, “we also don’t have any major uncertainties aboutwe can run or not next year so expect us to have plenty of info regrading Stendhal  out early in the new year, when we will also be opening our annual artists submission process.” For tickets and more info regarding Stendhal Festival , visit www.stendhalfestival.

The two smaller events which instigated numerous social distancing protocols combined to create the largest gathering of tents at a music festival anywhere in Ireland in  and with that experience under their belts, the team behind the multi-award-winning event have decided that the best way to try and get back to normality is to press forward with one larger event for approximately , people. googletag.cmd.push Festival Director Ross Parkhill explained: “Despite the dficulties, the uncertainties and all the additional rules and regulations we had to impose, both events in  went off really well and people really worked incredibly well with us in order to ensure that was the case. “Running two events provided big challenges for us but happily, as always, our amazing team rose to the occasion twice and more people camped at a music festival at Stendhal than anywhere  on the Island of Ireland this year, something we can really be proud of.” Ross continued: “Going forward though, to continue with the model of two smaller events would not be practical for us and we are confident that people are a bit more confident themselves now about ing to large scale outdoor gigs, as witnessed at a number of events in Belfast throughout September.     “With that in mind, with the eradication of social distancing rules for outdoor spaces and with plenty of lessons learned from our events in , we are confident that we canto our usual event set up in  and safely welcome over , patrons to the farm once again.” Super Saver Early bird tickets for Stendhal  will be on sale on October thth at pm and will be available until January th, when the organisers are hoping to make their first batch of line-up announcements. “By moving the event forward by about  weeks we have to hit the ground running,” added Ross, “we also don’t have any major uncertainties aboutwe can run or not next year so expect us to have plenty of info regrading Stendhal  out early in the new year, when we will also be opening our annual artists submission process.” For tickets and more info regarding Stendhal Festival , visit www.stendhalfestival.

Sinn Feacuteins Cllr Sean Bateson used a discussion on Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councils Grant Funding Policy Review to raise a question on the funding of a NI centenary event held at the weekend. googletag.cmd.push The event, part-funded by the Council, featured a historical re-enactment of a B-Specials drill demonstration and checkpoint, described by a local SDLP MLA as isive and crass. The organising committee of the event issued a statement to say no Council funding had been used to fund the demonstration. Cllr Sean Bateson Cllr Bateson asked officials at the Leisure and Development Committee to clary no public money had been spent on it. “I would like to speak on . on item  and specically, the NI small grants fund,” said the representative for Bann. “Can I ask the director for clarity on the awarding of this grant and in relation to the grossly inappropriate and deeply insensitive event at Coleraine Town Hall at the weekend      “My community was disgusted at this event and the re-enactment featuring a military display of the B-Specials. “The history of the B-Specials speaks for itself. It was effectively established as the paramilitary wing of the Orange state and was designed to subjugate nationalists and republicans. “For nationalists and republicans, such an event yet again clearly illustrates that the centenary of partition is being used by certain quarters as a show of triumphalism. “Can the director clary and put on recordthis grant went towards the funding and display of this event and the group that was involved in it  “Can the director give me a breakdown of the total Council funding and what it went towards ” Cllr John McAuley Committee Chair, Cllr John McAuley, told Cllr Bateson his question was not related to the agenda item the Grant Funding Policy Review. “You are quite aware that this isnt even part of the agenda,” said the DUP representative. “You did attempt to put in an AORBwhich you were too late for, and now you have decided to try and slip it in to make a few headlines with your republican agenda. “I try not to rise to these sort of things, but its a case of offended by everything and ashamed of nothing. Cllr Bateson began to protest that it was in fact part of the agenda, but Cllr McAuley told him he would chair the meeting as I choose to chair it. “Im the Chair, so Ill speakI want to speak. As a proud son of a B-man, I will not be letting you try and take over this Committee tonight to whitewash history. “Ill chair the meeting as I choose to chair it,” he added. Cllr George Duddy Cllr George Duddy then called a point of order, stating thatCllr Bateson continually interrupted the Chair, the Committee could vote on point of order . that the member not be heard on this item. “When the Chair speaks during the debate, any member speaking at the time must stop and the meeting must be silent,” said the DUP councillor. “Im not sure that Cllr Bateson understands standing orders, but you have asked him on more than one occasion, which is your perogative, to cease speaking, and he has continued to interrupt. “If Cllr Bateson continues, I will call point of order . for a member not to be heard any longer.” “Go ahead Cllr Duddy, I think it shows your agenda,” replied Cllr Bateson. The Committee then voted in favour of the point of order intervention, with nine voting for, two against and three abstentions. It marks the second time in four weeks that a Sinn Feacutein councillor has been subject to point of order . and no longer permitted to speak on an item. Cllr Duddy also called the point of order on Glens councillor Cara McShane at a previous meeting of the Leisure and Development Committee. The incident arose after a fellow DUP councillor claimed Cllr McShane insinuated he was a fool.  MLA criticises isive and crass B Specials re-enactment in County Derry  The demonstration took place on Saturday.

Destined operate centres in Derry and in Feeny, with the latter providing much needed services to more rural north Derry community. googletag.cmd.push Its aim is to build empowerment, address social isolation and exclusion and build lelong skills and self-confidence among its members. Fiona, Michael, Tamara, Peter, Owen, George, Kevin, Ryan and Gavin take a break from their cooking to speak to the County Derry Post last week. Through a iety of activities including karaoke, arts and crafts, cooking and gardening, the members have a busy week. Now, through funding provided by Rank Net Foundation under the Time to Shine project, the group are seeking to establish a new centre in north Derry to match their facility in the city. Some of the members spoke to the County Derry Post, and said more space was needed to complete their activities.     Kevin, Peter and Michael relaxing in the kitchen area of the centre in Feeny. “Its too small and we need more space to do our cooking and karaoke activities, and we havent much space for our computers upstairs,” said Tamara. “We could do with new computers too and maybe another sofa. Id love a nail bar to get some pampering done.” Kevin had his eye on a bigger TV. “We need the new centre because this one is too small. We need a bigger kitchen and a bigger TV,” he said. “If you have a bigger building you can space out more people and have better facilities for both children and adults.” Gavin is keen to show off the groups polytunnel outside the centre. George said everything about Destined was enjoyable, but that more space was the main priority. “I enjoy coming here, I like the people and the staff. Id be looking for more outside space as well. I love it here, but we need more room,” he said. A community survey was carried out earlier this month, with over  people taking part. Project Officer Grainne McNickle said the interest showed clearly an increased demand. “This has been an amazing response from the public,” she said. “The findings from this have strengthened the fact that there is an increasing demand for services in the rural areas to cater for everyone not just those with a Learning Disability. Cooking is just one of the activities the members enjoy at Destined. “Destined have been operating out of a small rented unit in Feeny for nearly ten years now and when the pandemic hit the building was deemed unsuitable for use. “A new centre would benefit Destined members, their family members, and will also be a great asset to people living in the surrounding area.” Alongside a consultation process, the group have worked closely with a steering committee of representatives from the Western Trust, local community groups and Rossmar Special School. The committee has completed a mapping exercise of where best to locate the new centre, and will begin the process of applying to potential funders when this is completed.

Destined operate centres in Derry and in Feeny, with the latter providing much needed services to more rural north Derry community. googletag.cmd.push Its aim is to build empowerment, address social isolation and exclusion and build lelong skills and self-confidence among its members. Fiona, Michael, Tamara, Peter, Owen, George, Kevin, Ryan and Gavin take a break from their cooking to speak to the County Derry Post last week. Through a iety of activities including karaoke, arts and crafts, cooking and gardening, the members have a busy week. Now, through funding provided by Rank Net Foundation under the Time to Shine project, the group are seeking to establish a new centre in north Derry to match their facility in the city. Some of the members spoke to the County Derry Post, and said more space was needed to complete their activities.     Kevin, Peter and Michael relaxing in the kitchen area of the centre in Feeny. “Its too small and we need more space to do our cooking and karaoke activities, and we havent much space for our computers upstairs,” said Tamara. “We could do with new computers too and maybe another sofa. Id love a nail bar to get some pampering done.” Kevin had his eye on a bigger TV. “We need the new centre because this one is too small. We need a bigger kitchen and a bigger TV,” he said. “If you have a bigger building you can space out more people and have better facilities for both children and adults.” Gavin is keen to show off the groups polytunnel outside the centre. George said everything about Destined was enjoyable, but that more space was the main priority. “I enjoy coming here, I like the people and the staff. Id be looking for more outside space as well. I love it here, but we need more room,” he said. A community survey was carried out earlier this month, with over  people taking part. Project Officer Grainne McNickle said the interest showed clearly an increased demand. “This has been an amazing response from the public,” she said. “The findings from this have strengthened the fact that there is an increasing demand for services in the rural areas to cater for everyone not just those with a Learning Disability. Cooking is just one of the activities the members enjoy at Destined. “Destined have been operating out of a small rented unit in Feeny for nearly ten years now and when the pandemic hit the building was deemed unsuitable for use. “A new centre would benefit Destined members, their family members, and will also be a great asset to people living in the surrounding area.” Alongside a consultation process, the group have worked closely with a steering committee of representatives from the Western Trust, local community groups and Rossmar Special School. The committee has completed a mapping exercise of where best to locate the new centre, and will begin the process of applying to potential funders when this is completed.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.         Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.         The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.         Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

The comments were made during a Government press conference on Tuesday October th, after the announcement of the countrysrevised reopening plan, where Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin confirmed all of the restrictions set to ease from Friday,  October and the restrictions that will remain in place. googletag.cmd.push The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol.     Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps.     Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Michelle Devine at The Cottage Coffee Shop with their awards Derry NewsDerry cafeacute takes home top prize for best scones in the country overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsArrest made in drugs operation linked to INLA in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsFormer County Derry bank building goes on rental market overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMurdered County Derry man was victim of alleged assault last year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Police in Derry appeal for anyone who believes they have had their drink spiked last weekend to contact themDerry NewsPolice appealing for anyone who believes they had their drink spiked while out in Derry city-centre last weekend to contact them overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

He creates dark ambient as An Trinse, lo-fi Techno as TFT and has the monthly show ‘First Trans- mission’ on Threads radio. He also works as a designer and animator who has created multi-disciplinary work for clients including Nike and Adidas.  What influences you  googletag.cmd.push “With the An Trinse project I’ve always thought of it as being indebted musically to the surrealism of Nurse with Wound and later Coil with a heavy dose of Irish history in there. “My techno records as TFT are much more straightforward and fit into the classic Dutch Clone Viewlex template or L.I.E.S. I’ve enjoyed handing over the visual side to Ben Lee who is an incredible designer. The current visual work with Maxwell Sterling stems from getting obsessed with Peter Greenway a long time ago and suddenly having an outlet for this baroque sensibility. “Max’s work is so rich and cinematic I was instantly inspired to find a way to create a version of the layered theatrical world of Prosperos Books mixed with images generated via AI with painterly elements and I think we have arrived at a pretty inidual visual soup.”     Any Irish stuff out there  “Some of my favourite Irish music of the last few years has come from the label Fort Evil Fruit, they have built up a formidable discography over the last decade across the spectrum of experimental sound. “Also, a big fan of From the Bogs of Aughuska as we share a love of the crossover of Irish History, drone, and black metal who I always thought deserved more attention, but I guess it’s a bit of a niche interest. “Recently been loving the unpronounceable Lighght from Cork who makes really eclectic danceable electronica”. How was your lockdown  “I can’t pretend I didn’t think it was the end of the world at the start but once we settled into the long-drawn-out boring apocalypse it has shaken up my work a bit. I was in great form, had just completed an An Trinse audio-visual show which premiered at one of CTM festival in Berlin’s associated events in January and was hoping to tour the projects throughout the year plus was in the process of setting up a celebratory gig for my split album with Il Santo Bevitore. “I had also just worked on the visual direction of the NME awards which was one of the biggest projects I had overseen. “That all went in the bin along with my main revenue source working as an editor and animator in the creative industry, so it was a very scary few months till everything stabilised a bit. I tried to use the time to collaborate with artists on music videos which crazily ended up helping on Kylie Minogue’s online show and directing a piece for Yousef and Gorgon City. “I also ended up exhibiting work in some online exhibitions which has led to my current work with the Most Dismal Swamp collective but there was a lot of staring at the wall wondering where it was all going. “Later in the year, I did some online gigs including a collaboration with Bratislavan artists Monika Subrtova which felt gooda little weird staring in a camera in an empty room. The project with Maxwell came out of lockdown as well, we were both working on a video project with architecture collective The Decorators who were similarly trying to find ways to show work when everyone is stuck in the house. “That project has just been shown at the V  A museum at the London Design Festival which was a bit of a dream come true.” New normal  “I’m hoping that the show me and Maxwell are doing at MIRA festival in Barcelona is the start of something positive for the new year.

at half time.Downpatrick were desperately unlucky not to find the back of the net just minutes into the second half,as McGrady ran clear of the defenders after a looping ball over the topseemed to have caught Clonduff napping.With lsquokeeper Gribben already off his line, he made the decision to challenge McGrady in an aerial dual that the Downpatrick number  managed to win.However, his slapped effort over the head of the Clonduff custodian clipped back off the post and backinto the possession of the grateful Yellas.A minute later and the Hoops were back threatening the opposition defence, but Clonduff held firm when Branniganrsquos lsquorsquo effort dropped into the danger zone.Barry OrsquoHagan punished the Hoops for not taking their chances as his free sailed over the bar, before Downpatrickrsquos Oran Cunningham saw his effort drt wide at the other end.Charlie Carr extended his sidersquos lead with his second point of the game, although Tim Prenter managed to keep the RGU in touch with a no-nonsense score.McConville restored the margin with a left footed strike before his free pushed his side further in front.Darren OrsquoHagan showed no signs of slowing down as he began bossing play with piercing runs and cute passing, allowing the Yellas to put a foothold on the game.Doherty saw his free drt wide off the mark before Close punished the Hoops with a finely taken point to close out the action before the second water-break.Downpatrick knew the clock was against them, but they werenrsquot quite at panic station yet, as Brannigan converted yet another free after teammate Sean Bell was fouled.Clonduff midfielder Ross Carr pointed immediately after before Brannigan once more replied with a free.However, Darren OrsquoHagan began the move that would decide the match, after a string of neat passes and clever off the ball movement allowed his brother Barry to nip in behind the Downpatrick defence before calmly slotting home into the bottom right corner.The now six-point advantage truly seemed to deflate the Downpatrick side who now knew it would take something very special to force extra-time.Despite a Brannigan free, McConville wrapped up the scoring with a lovely left footed strike to ensure it was his Clonduff outfit who would enter the semi-final draw.This signalled the end of the road for the Downpatrick men, who gave a great account of themselves in this yearrsquos competition.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney , A Doherty, R Murphy, S Bell, J Bell, C Doherty , D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter , G Collins, C McGrady , J Brannigan , O Cunningham, C Mooney.Subs: T Smyth, P Turley, A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, T Louden, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, G Trainor.Clonduff: P Gribben, J OrsquoHagan, D OrsquoHagan, T McEvoy, L Branagan, C Carr , J Gribben, R Carr, A Carr , T Close , P OrsquoHagan, B OrsquoHagan , A McConville , S McConville, E Brown.Subs: N Trainor, C Brown, R Brannigan, S McGreevy, P Lively, R Lively, T McGreevy, B McConville, P Wilson, J Boden, M McPolin, K OrsquoHagan, F McConville..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Co.jpg","title":"Co Down Rural Community opens new hub in Newcastle  ","story":"THE Co Down Rural Community Network has opened a new wellbeing hub in Newcastle.The new facility is intended to be a central point in the resort to make it easier for people to access information, advice and support and participate in activities to improve their mental and physical health and wellbeing.It will work with iniduals, community members, local groups, and multi-disciplinary teamsto identy community needs and facilitate better access to mental health and wellbeing training and resources.The opening of the new hub is the culmination of the Community Network working with local GPs and primary care teams and the wider community for over  years.Over the past three years, the network has linked up with the MDTs in the local primary care practices.The network has a team of social prescribers and an MDT coordinator who take referrals from GP practices, pharmacists and from other sources and find solutions for people who may be affected by physical limitations or mental health issues or who simply feel isolated in their own homes.This work has intensied during the Covid pandemic, making the opening of the hub even more timely.A total of  people have been referred by the local GPs and their teams to the Community Network since January this year in addition to the  clients that the Social Prescribing team have been working with since .Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who officially opened the news hub on Monday, has described it as a ldquogreat asset for the Community Network team and those who formerly operated a connect and chat service.ldquoGroups of all sorts now have a base to operate from in a beautul and peaceful location.

The project manager Mr Mike Gibb, said Delamont had always been his first option but he could no longer afford to wait on the council.Mr Gibbrsquos announcement dashes hopes that the centre, which is destined to become the largest owl and birds of prey rescue facility in Europe, would come to Killyleagh.Mr Gibb had entered negotiations with Down Council last year regarding the possible construction of the sanctuary at Delamont.But the project became the subject of controversial debates within the council chamber earlier this year amid accusations that council officials were dragging their heels about the proposal, leading Mr Gibb to look for alternative locations.CLOUGH ndash Residents opposing plans for the erection of a BT Cellnet mobile telephone mast in Clough have formed an action group to try and block the plan.At a meeting in the village on Monday, residents got together after they heard local environmentalist, Walter Graham, outlined the drawbacks and health risks associated with these masts.Plans for the -metre mast which,approved, will be sited within the Watsonrsquos filling station complex, were published several weeks ago andaccepted could be operating within months.Up to  residents gathered in the Old School House, just a stonersquos throw from the proposed site, to hear of the risks and implications these masts are believed to cause.Villagers heard how the transmitter could dominate the skyline, towering over homes, a primary school, petrol station and an old peoplersquos home.Claiming that scientists believed the growth of cancers were ldquospurred on by the transmitters, he said. ldquoIf this mast goes up my children are coming out of school, there is no way they will study in the shadow of that mast.

Three minutes later the visitors had their first effort when from Casey Courtneyrsquos long throw, Christopher McKay headed back to Courtney but his enterprising effort was wide.Villa should have been ahead in the th minute but Aaron Carberry produced an outstanding double save.The game was being played at a frantic pace with both midfields battling for supremacy with Jon Joe Sharvin and Darren McConnell linking to produce an outstanding pass for Jack Sharvin but his effort was well blocked.Soon afterwards there was almost a repeat with McConnell and Barry Walsh linking, and Jack Sharvin flashing the ball across the six yard box.Killyleagh were playing some neat football with Jonny Murray and Jon Joe Sharvin combining for Jamie Sharvin to almost thread it through for Declan McComiskey. There was time for Jamie Sharvin to stride forward and try a long range effort.The visitors have made an outstanding start to the season, reaching the quarter finals of the Steel Cup, and they knocked the ball about with confidence as they had their best spell of the game.A free kick from the impressive Arthurs was cleared for a corner in the th minute and then, six minutes later, first Jamie Sharvin blocked the effort from McKayrsquos knock down, and Jonny Murray cleared a clever short corner as Thomas Dickson prepared to strike.At the opposite end twice before the interval Jack Sharvin went close, first with a free kick on the far left and then he had an effort cleared off the line in the nd minute but in truth both teams were very evenly matched in the first half.Killyleagh took control in the second half with a midfield masterclass from Barry Walsh and Darren McConnell in particular, and McComiskey having a lot of joy down the left side. After  minutes they were awarded a penalty when Jack Sharvin was fouled in a clumsy challenge from Courtney inside the box.However, Sharvinrsquos spot kick was brilliantly saved by Andy Wallace.Four minutes later and Wallace produced heroics again, this time a save with his feet from Sam Carson after McComiskeyrsquos pace had again exposed Villa.The goal was coming, though, and it was goal of brilliance. Jack Sharvin curled the ball round his marker Hylands from the edge of the box and into the stanchion of the goal in the th minute.It was a goal worthy of winning any cup tie, at any level. For a long time it looked asit would.Killyleagh had half chances, after this, with Walsh again winning his midfield tussle with Dickson to set up Jon Joe Sharvin and then Jack Sharvin went even closer from brother Jamiersquos free kick. Villa had half chances too at the opposite end with Jake Wilson going close to an equaliser.Then came that dramatic finale. Wilson was presented with a second chance in the box after his initial effort was saved and he produced a stunning finish high into the net from a tight angle.Cue th minute pandemonium and it seemed the tie was set for extra time.But when the game was restarted Killyleagh won a corner and after two blocks at close range the ball was eventually scrambled over the line by Jon Joe Sharvin in the th minute.The huge crowd contained several former players from the first Killyleagh team to win the Border Cup in  and now Paul Sharvin will be hoping his team get a chance to match that Christmas glory.To reach the semi-finals, however, they must beat Crumlin United on November  ndash a chance to avenge an incredible - defeat when the teams last met in this competition exactly two yearsrsquo ago when Killyleagh tossed away a - half-time lead in the last nine minutes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Slieve.jpg","title":"Slieve Donard sold for £40m  ","story":"NEWCASTLErsquoS iconic Slieve Donard Resort and Spa has been sold in a poundm deal to American investors.Owned by the Hastings family since , the world famous five-star hotel has been acquired by US-based AJ Capital Partners which is planning a major upgrade.After weeks of speculation that the hotel had been sold, the news was finally confirmed last Thursday with the new owner a Nashville-headquartered real estate developer and hotel operator with more than  hotels across the US and Britain, including St Andrews in Scotland.Announcing that the Newcastle hotel has been acquired, AJ Capital also confirmed that renovation work is planned to start in October next year, with the work completed by the following spring.During the planned upgrade, the hotel will remain closed.Howard Hastings mdash the managing director of Hastings Hotels mdash described AJ Capital Partnersrsquos acquisition of the Slieve Donard Resort and Spa as ldquoencouraging news for hospitality and tourism in Northern Ireland.He said it also represented a boost for the burgeoning golf tourism industry which ldquohas been an important driver of local tourism in recent years and shows signicant growth potential in the future.Mr Hastings added: ldquoI have every confidence that AJ Capital Partners will be sympathetic to the heritage of the hotel and that, under their leadership, it will continue to flourish and maintain its reputation as an iconic destination in Northern Ireland.ldquoThis investment is a strong sign of confidence in the local market by a major international hotel operator with exciting ambitions for the Slieve Donard in the coming years.

There is a veritable alphabet soup of dissident republican micro groups, like RNU, RSF and Saoradh.One of them, CSM had urged a protest at the centenary service saying that the “British Queen is not welcome”.Republican dissidents always have their finger on the pulse.Unfortunately, it is the pulse of Patrick Pearse. My favourite story about them goes back to  when the GAA changed its strict rules about only permitting Gaelic games in GAA facilities in order to allow a rugby match to be played at Croke Park. Dissidents held a small protest outside the ground. One protester had a placard that read “Say no to foreign sports!”He was wearing a Celtic top. IRISH LEAGUE IN HEADLINES... FOR WRONG REASONS:Regular readers will know that I am a big fan of local football. I’ve always wanted more people to watch Irish League matches. Well this week I got my wish. Sadly however it wasn’t because of the quality of the football, but instead because of the rather robust criticism of one Glentoran player by the Glentoran goalkeeper. Well, I say criticism.It was an assault really.Yes, on Saturday, after the team conceded a goal, Glentoran player Bobby Burns was attacked and thrown to the ground by the Glentoran goalkeeper Aaron McCarey. By Monday, footage of the remarkable incident had gone viral and acquired over one and a half million views.Gary Lineker tweeted the clip with the epithet “WTF ” Clearly he thought Warrenpoint Town Football club were involved.No Gary! It was Glentoran v Coleraine. To be fair to Aaron McCarey, the incident does illustrate the great passion you get in our local game.So please do go out and support your local team. I can’t promise top-class entertainment like they got at the Oval on Saturday at every match.But I can guarantee full-throttled fervour and enthusiasm. Meanwhile, across the water there was controversy when Newcastle United were bought over by a consortium closely connected to the Saudi Arabian government. Some of their fans seem almost entirely unconcerned by the human rights record of the new owners. This is not entirely surprising. Football and morality rarely go hand in hand. In fact football and morality go together like Ben Lowry and an Irish Language Act. As a Cltonville fan my only concern is that there are no evil despots or dodgy billionaires left in the world to invest millions in the club.Of course the perfect person to take us over would be Donald Trump – because then, evenwe were to lose a match, the Donald would just insist that we won. SO. FAREWELL THEN, NI UKIP:To misquote Oscar Wilde: “You have to have a heart of stone to read about the death of the Northern Ireland branch of UKIP without laughing.”Yes, Six Counties UKIP has disbanded. It is no more. It is deceased. Bereft of le. It rests in peace. It has shuffled off its mortal coil and gone and joined the choir invisible. At last, a tangible Brexit benefit.Local UKIP members were said to be “frustrated” that UK members “showed little interest in affairs this side of the Irish Sea”. This is of course the irony of Unionist support for Brexit. The vast majority of UK Leave voters know little and care less about Northern Ireland. Many of them think the leader of the DUP is Gerry Adams and that PIRA was Village People’s follow up to YMCA.As startling evidence of this I give you the ex-leader of UKIP, Nigel “Nige” Farage – who has also gone viral by appearing on a video saying “up the Ra”. Mind you, after the Protocol, Sinn Fein supporters have been known to shout “Up the Nige!” Nigel says he was tricked and he didn’t know what it meant. Come off it Nige! You’ve been sitting beside Arlene Foster on the GB News sofa for months now – surely she’s told you something about here. Nigel made the comment on Cameo, a site where you can get “celebrities” to send you personal greetings – apparently he was paid £ or € .We learnt this week that Ian Paisley also has account on Cameo and will send you a video greeting for money.It allows “fans” to get personalised message from the great man...’s son.No prices for an Ian Junior video are included.Clearlyyou have to ask, you can’t afford him. So we’re not surehe is charging £, £ quid, or the cost of a Males beach hut. AND SLAINTE!Finally, it has been a very good week for the distinguished Irish writer Bearnard Labhardha, or Ben Lowry, as I believe he prefers to be known. His day has come. His la has chuckeed.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLeaving the main car park and tramping pavements along Heol Gorllewin to pass the Prince of Wales pub, which features in the tale of the Maid of Sker, the group then entered the southern part of the vast Kenfig Burrows. These burrows were once part of a huge dune system that stretched all the way from the River Ogmore to the Gower peninsula and this area along with Kenfig is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest.With the dogs racing ahead enjoying their adventure and freedom, the narrow sandy paths adorned in places by the pretty Michaelmas-daisy led them through the burrows before turning southwards towards the coast.Reaching Kenfig Sands where the tide was on the ebb there were fantastic views south westwards towards Jersey Marine, Swansea Bay, Mumbles and Gower beyond as they settled down utilising washed up tree trunks as seating for morning refreshments in warm sunshine with a welcome breeze.Returning onto the coast path above the beach the group made their way eastwards to reach Sker Point with its fantastic long-distance views back across Kenfig Sands, spoiled only by the industrial smoke and buildings of Port Talbot Steelworks.Following the coastline soon the yellow painted Sker House came into view which signalled their lunch stop overlooking Sker Rocks which was the setting on April , , when the Samtampa a former Liberty ship was making its way up the Bristol Channel towards Newport in a south westerly gale. Developing an engine fault, the captain dropped anchor so repairs could begin, but the weather worsened to hurricane force winds, the ship slipped its anchor and was driven onto Sker Rocks. Mumbles leboat was launched to try to save the crew, but the Samtampa began to break up and all  of its crew drowned, along with the eight volunteer crew members of the Mumbles leboat which was later found upside down and smashed to pieces.     Continuing along the coast path with views across Rest Bay to Locks Common in Porthcawl and reaching the western perimeter of the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, they ventured inland following a narrow path between fences, with a field of beautul Welsh Black cattle as the heat rose, before an open field brought them through a gate into Nottage.A short journey along the busy and fast-moving West Road brought them to a rough track opposite Parc Newydd Farm, which led them to overlook the impressive, imposing and dramatic Grade One listed Sker House, which was originally founded by the Cistercian monks of Neath as one of five farms or granges to support Neath Abbey. The house was remodelled by the Turberville family in the mid-th century after which it was tenanted and then sold to the Williams family in the late th century.This was when the romantic, heart rendering story of the lsquoMaid of Skerrsquo began involving Elizabeth Williams, an attractive young lady who loved to dance in the old Town Hall above the Prince of Wales Inn at Kenfig, where the music was supplied by a harpist.One evening the harpist was Thomas Evans and upon meeting they were smitten and fell in love. For a while he courted her, but her father was against the union as he felt being the daughter of a successful landowner and farmer, Thomas Evans was beneath her as he was a mere carpenter and so he imprisoned her in Sker House.The couple tried to elope, but their plans were thwarted and until Elizabeth agreed to marry her fatherrsquos choice of husband - Thomas Kirkwood of Neath - she was not freed. They married and had four children settling in Briton Ferry, but it was an unhappy liaison andher true love was playing in the area, Elizabeth would sneak out to hear him play. She died in , it is said of a broken heart, and was buried at Llansamlet, but her unfulfilled and unhappy ghost is said to still walk at Sker.Following a track and crossing part of the Pyle and Kenfig golf course brought them back to their start point after what had been a delightful scenic and interesting tramp through history in stunning weather for the month of October.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We have had great success with online bridge during the pandemic, but now we have reopened for Face-to-Face bridge our numbers are too small to be viable.Please come and support this historic club. However, letrsquos be positive. We are exploring merging our Tuesday and Friday evening sessions with another club.And,all fails, we will resume online bridge. Penarth Bridge Club will live on!So, here is a recent hand played at a Face-to-Face session where careful judgment by both declarer and the defence were required to achieve the optimum result.The AuctionNorth had seven spades and just seven points, ideal for a pre-emptive opening of three spades. The aim of pre-emptive bids is to put a spanner in the wheel of the defence.However, the danger always is that, as here, your partner has a good hand and so has a dficult decision to make on whether to pass or bid on for game. After some thought, South could see at least six spade tricks, evenhis partner did not have the king of spades.There were also two certain heart tricks, and it ought to be possible to rustle up a trick in diamonds and one more from Northrsquos hand. So, South bid four spades.The playTrick  ndash East was on lead and did not fancy a diamond or a club. And the jack of hearts lead was fraught with danger. So, interestingly, East chose to lead the five of spades, reasoning that his king was safe for a trickNorth held the ace.     And evenSouth held three spades to the ace, North must surely have an entry somewhere to take the spade finesse. Anyway, declarer paused to consider the hand.Without the trump lead the contract would have been secure as he could have ruffed a losing club in dummy. But now things were dficult.North decided to play the ace of spades, hoping to drop a singleton king in Westrsquos hand. But no luck. Tricks  and  ndash Declarer then played a club to his ace, followed by a small club from hand, the trick being won by Eastrsquos king.East was now quite pleased he had decided to lead a trump at the first trick. Trick  - East won the next trick with the king of spades, preventing declarer from ruffing his losing club.Trick  ndash East then led his ace of diamonds, which was ruffed by declarer in hand. Trick  ndash Declarer drew Eastrsquos last trump with his queen, discarding a heart from dummy. But he could now see he still had a losing club and a losing heart, one down, having already lost two tricks.But could there be a squeeze on  Tricks , ,  and  ndash Declarer then rattled off his last four spades, forcing four discards from both East and West. East could see that dummy had to discard before West, so he jettisoned his remaining four diamonds, keeping the jack of clubs and two hearts.Declarer decided to discard one more heart and the rest of dummyrsquos diamonds. West had to hope his partner East held the jack of clubs, otherwise he was genuinely squeezed. So, he discarded the rest of his clubs, keeping his three hearts to the queen.Declarer then played a small heart to dummyrsquos ace. He followed this with the king of hearts. Bad luck, Eastrsquos jack dropped but not Westrsquos queen. Trick  - West then won the last trick with his queen of hearts, declarer only making nine tricks - six spades, two hearts, and one club, one down for a loss of  points.Four spades was a perfectly reasonable bid by South. But well done by the defence for the opening lead and care in their discards.What have we learnt . areful judgement is needed when responding to partnerrsquos opening pre-emptive bid, particularly when non vulnerable, since the pre-emptive bid is likely to be quite weak.. Sometimes it can quite be safe to lead a trump from three to king, as here.Penarth club resultsFriday  October: . Joy Seculer and Mike Downey. Peter Craig and Sean Macdougall.

NormandierCouncillor Neil Thomas, a former governor at Evenlode, said: ldquoOne problem was the transition from Bute Cottage to Evenlode, because Bute Cottage was using dferent reading and numeracy schemes from Evenlode. It was a source of irritation for the reception teachers that they had to basically reteach the children to fit into the new schemes.ldquoThis change should improve that situation, because yoursquore not going to get that conflict of schemes.ldquoTherersquos a lot of misinformation going around, and therersquos a lot on social media saying that the Bute Cottage site is going to be closed and developed, and the open area next to it is going to become a building site. None of which is referred to in this report and all of which has been denied.ldquoTheyrsquore alleging that there are plans to move Bute Cottage physically and rebuild it on the grounds of Evenlodemdashagain that is something expressly ruled out. But thatrsquos something being put out on social media, and Irsquom wonderingthatrsquos for political reasons to stir up anxiety and worry among the community. There are no such plans in place.As part of the public consultation, a cabinet report was published describing the merger plans in detail. According to Cllr Gordon Kemp, chair of the scrutiny committee, some of the concerns could be caused by people not reading that -page report in full.He said: ldquoI think part of the problem with the original cabinet report was the reference that they would remain in the same buildings was tucked away in the report. It wasnrsquot there right at the beginning, and perhaps some people donrsquot read as far as they should, unfortunately.However, the cabinet report, towards the end, discussed how the council would indeed consider relocating the nursery. It said: ldquoShould the proposals be approved, the council would prioritise relocating nursery provision at Evenlode Primary School onto a single site.The report added the council would first assess the feasibility of the relocation, and would then also consult the public before any changes.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education and regeneration, denied there were any plans to relocate the nursery. But she added the council would ldquoprobably exploreit were possible.She said: ldquoThere are no plans to change the sites of either the nursery schools. There is a small section in the consultation document that says that there would be feasibility work undertaken to see whether or not there should be a move over to the Evenlode site. Itrsquos one of those things where yoursquore damnedyou do and damnedyou donrsquot.ldquoIf we hadnrsquot put anything in and somebody had said lsquowhat are you going to do about moving to one sitersquo, we would say wersquoll probably do some feasibility work on it to see whether or not itrsquos an option. Butwe put it in, then itrsquos a done deal. Itrsquos not a done deal.ldquoI really donrsquot know how you could build a separate nursery on the Evenlode site, but thatrsquos my personal view. Butthat feasibility work proved that it were possible, then you would have to go right the way back to another consultation. This is purely about amalgamating management and governance s within the schools.The consultation runs until November  and details of the plans can be found on the councilrsquos website.

I had nothing to anchor my le against ndash I was just drting.ldquoI didnrsquot know what I was pushing so hard for or why. What did I want from le  What was important to me  I had no idea.Ms Hall, who has three daughters ndash aged , , and one ndash began to lose interest in herself and others and stopped taking care of herself she isolated herself and drank too much alcohol, trying to hide from le.She was getting ill but thought it would pass. Despite having a panic attack so severe she thought it was a heart attack and calling an ambulance she didnrsquot ask for help.By , at the age of , she hit ldquorock bottom ndash she was emotionally numb, she couldnrsquot be bothered to shower or get dressed.ldquoI didnrsquot really know what I wanted from le, so had no compass, said Ms Hall.ldquoI wasnrsquot taking enough time to look after myself and got caught up in the pressures of work to the extent that they became all consuming.     Ms Hall is in a better place mentally now and is a self-development coach and speaker. Two years after her breakdown, she set up her own business, ran the London Marathon to raise money for the charity Mind and she is a volunteer director for Mind Cymru.She also started writing as a cathartic exercise but, upon realising she could help others, decided to write a book: Making Sense of Me: Nothing Changes Until I Change - A Guide to a Resilient Le at Home and at Work.ldquoThe book is a combination of my personal story and insights from neuroscience to help people cope with, manage and bounce back from burnout, said Ms Hall.ldquoI still have my ups and downs, like anyone , but I feel like I am the one in charge of me. I still get tired and fed up, but the dference now is that I know when Irsquom reaching the tipping point between wellness and illness.ldquoI know when I need to stop and restore my energy levels. I have learnt that health and self-care come first. Without that nothing  happens anyway.Ms Hall now takes time to be mindful and enjoy time with her daughters. She values her loved ones more than ever before and ndash although shersquos still passionate about her work ndash knows ldquowhen it has to come second.OTHER NEWS:ldquoI donrsquot derive my sense of achievement and wellbeing from others anymore ndash I get that from me, said Ms Hall.ldquoI hope people who read my book know that it is okay not to be okay whoever you are and whatever your circumstances.ldquoDonrsquot let pride or fear of failure prevent you from taking action to help yourself. You need to understand who you are before you can change anything my book talks about awareness, acceptance, and action.ldquoIf you understand yourself ndash who you are and why you respond to le the way you do ndash then you can choose to change and respond dferentlyyou want to.ldquoI had the choice to stay where I was or get better: I chose to get better.ldquoThank you to anyone who reads the book. I hope it helps one or more people ndash I had to hit a wall to get help, but you donrsquot have to do that!Making Sense of Me: Nothing Changes Until I Change - A Guide to a Resilient Le at Home and at Work is available at Grfin Books in Penarth and online via Amazon.Itrsquos had positive feedback which you can read at https:amzn.to vqNVbuGet involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
