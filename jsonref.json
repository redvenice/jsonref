Presumably, because their scope is so limited, they become more resourceful when looking for a mate.At Amsterdam\u0027s Artis Zoo — where managers once launched what they called \u0027Gayded tours\u0027 embracing the animals sexual preferences — the sex life of their pygmy chimpanzees was been likened to \u0027a permanent gay orgy\u0027 by one spokeswoman. Then there\u0027s the bisexual bonobos who are at it every 90 minutes.In the avian world, homosexuality is even more common.Nearly a quarter of black swan families are parented by same sex couples — the male mating with the female to produce an egg, which he promptly steals and hatches with the help of another male.Studies have shown that up to 15 per cent of female western gulls in some populations have homosexual tendencies, enjoying courtship rituals such as head tossing, proffering small gifts of carefully chosen food, or building nests together.Some live together like old married couples, such as Carlos and Fernando, a pair of gay flamingos who for years cohabited at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust in Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, stealing eggs from other couples, hatching the chicks and feeding them with milk they produced in their throats.But the most famous gay avian couple were Roy and Silo, a pair of male chinstrap penguins who got together in the late Nineties at New York\u0027s Central Park Zoo and had eyes only for each other for seven long years.While staff never witnessed them in the sexual act, they were forever entwining necks and making mating calls and, in 1999, were found trying to hatch a rock as if it were an egg.Today, there seems no question that all creatures great and small exhibit homosexual tendencies, but some people still tend to get rather het up about it all.Even BBC legend Sir David Attenborough, 93, got it in the neck from an academic from the University of East Anglia for \u0027ignoring gay animals\u0027 back in 2009 after describing male chimps hugging as \u0027friendly affection\u0027.Complicated it may be, but it brings us neatly back to Lachlan, Dawn and those gay giraffes.

But it isn’t an entirely flattering portrait: Comrade Bill is suspicious of intellectuals and generally uninterested in the culture that is supposed to be his concern.“She got bits of him right and she got bits of him wrong,” said Aaronovitch on the programme. “My mother always said, whenever people mentioned Doris Lessing: ‘Oh that liar.’ I think what she meant was that the writer … takes the liberty of assuming that the thing they need the person to be is the thing they are and slaps them down on the page … My mother reacted to it very badly.”Roland Barthes, and those who believe that biographical context shouldn’t influence our understanding of a text, would perhaps have had stern things to say to Aaronovitch’s mother as David said, Lessing was just doing what writers do. Even so, it’s easy to understand why Mrs Aaronovitch was so narked.You can get a taste of this shock of recognition (if not the personal outrage) by delving into Lessing’s archive, which is held at the University of East Anglia in Norwich. Some of it has been opened for public viewing to coincide with the 100th anniversary of Lessing’s birth this month – and it reveals some fascinating correspondences between her real life and her fictional creation.One of the first things I saw was a picture of an RAF airman, and a series of evocatively old-fashioned airmail envelopes exchanged by Lessing and Coll MacDonald. MacDonald was one of three pilots Lessing knew in Southern Rhodesia in 1944. (The other two were Leonard Smith and John Whitehorn.)I’m guessing the mention of three RAF men in Southern Rhodesia is enough for those who have read The Golden Notebook to have that flash of cognisance: MacDonald, Smith and Whitehorn were like Ted, Paul and Jimmy, the young airmen in the Black Notebook sections of the novel. The coincidences of youth, geography and occupation aren’t the only things that jump out of the letters: there are tangled affections, adulteries, earnest political conversations and concerns about “segregation” that might have come direct from the novel. Then there are passages such as this one:We dance. I have a dim recollection of drinking brandy … and dancing madly all by myself in the middle of the floor at the Ace of Spades the other night, and generally speaking and behaving in a shocking if enjoyable fashion.Even more striking are the notebooks where Lessing recounts arguments with her leftist American lover Clancy Sigal. These seem to have been dropped almost verbatim into The Golden Notebook in the sections about Anna Wulf and her American lover Saul Green. The Washington Independent Review of Books even accused Lessing of “theft” because she transposed large sections of Sigal’s notebooks into the novel. When he became aware that Lessing was reading them, he began to write false entries to catch her out. And yes, all this also ended up in The Golden Notebook, where Lessing draws a wonderfully absurd conclusion:The position is reached where each keeps two diaries: one for private use, and locked up and the second for the other to read. Then one of them makes a slip of the tongue or a mistake and the other accuses himher of having found the secret diary. A terrible quarrel which drives them apart forever.Mixed up with all this intensely personal material is some fascinating politics. There are extracts from the files MI5 kept on Lessing because of her communist sympathies. There is politan police file noting the occupation in her passport as “writer” and detailing how HM Customs has carried out “a discreet search” of her bag and found “nothing of interest to Special Branch”.On the other side of the equation are the letters Lessing was exchanging with a “Mr Aplaten” in Moscow. One of hers sympathised with the loss of his “great leader” Stalin. One from him (which must have crossed in the post with Lessing’s) was written on the very day that the mass murderer died: an event that does much to shake up the characters in The Golden Notebook.To read through such material is to see the foundations of the novel. In October 2007, shortly after her Nobel prize win, Lessing did an event with UEA where she gave typically short shrift to the idea of even discussing The Golden Notebook. “You know we’re reading a 50-year-old book here. That’s a long time ago,” she said. But then she added: “This book, the essential thing about this book is that it has some kind of a charge which comes from the conditions I was writing in.” Small wonder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daf06f3312f99c278700ca3f397033479c9ac579/0_212_5720_3432/master/5720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e9c4cdedacfa24c06ca9328906f8a80","title":"mindfck christopher wylie targeted brittany kaiser cambridge analytica review","story":"Hindsight is the only exact science, as these two books confirm. Chris Wylie and Brittany Kaiser are two youngish, idealistic, clever people who got involved in some very dark stuff orchestrated by unscrupulous operators. Eventually, both realised they had become accomplices to activities that were at best unethical and at worst illegal, realisations that prompted them to break loose and blow the whistle. And both their memoirs, though very different in style and tone, are attempts to atone for the societal damage their respective collaborations with the devil have done.But there the similarities end. Wylie is an unorthodox, gay Canadian who is passionately interested in fashion Kaiser is a straight, liberal American interested in human rights and other humanitarian causes. And yet both were ensnared in the same net: a sinister dirty-tricks, election-manipulating “consultancy” outfit called SCL run by a sociopathic old Etonian, Alexander Nix, which eventually spawned another company called Cambridge Analytica (CA), which was the vehicle that did most of the democratic damage.CA succeeded by finding a way of leveraging people’s personal data – as revealed by its activities on Facebook in conjunction with data purchased from credit agencies, data brokers and other sources – to offer psychological profiles in ways that would reveal the kinds of political messages to which they might be receptive. “Facebook,” as Wylie puts it early in his account, “is no longer just a company. It’s a doorway into the minds of the American people and Mark Zuckerberg left that door open for Cambridge Analytica, the Russians and who knows how many others.”The idea that Facebook “likes” could provide a window into people’s souls did not originate with CA, but in research conducted at Cambridge University (much to that institution’s subsequent chagrin). As a talented geek who is fascinated by human behaviour, however, Wylie immediately understood the significance of the research and had the programming skills to build scalable tools for deducing from the data psychological traits of voters that could then be exploited for political purposes.As a result, his book is – inadvertently – an invaluable primer on psychological warfare and behaviour modification. It’s clear that Wylie played a key role in developing the technology that enabled political operators to effectively target messages to inidual voters. And although nobody knows what – ultimately – makes an inidual cast a vote one way or another, what now seems incontrovertible is that social media can suppress voter turnout by finding people who are doubtful or reluctant about voting and persuading them to stay home.Ever since Brexit and the election of Trump there has been consistent scepticism about whether social media played a significant role in the political upheavals of 2016. That scepticism began to be dented when Carole Cadwalladr and the Observer revealed what Cambridge Analytica had been up to with Facebook data. But paradoxically, it was also boosted by Channel 4’s undercover filming that accompanied Cadwalladr’s scoop. The film showed the SCL boss, Nix, in his pomp, where he came over as a nattily suited trust-funder constantly exaggerating the capacity of his firm to achieve its clients’ objectives. How could such an obvious chancer bring about political earthquakes?The answer is that he couldn’t, but the tech-heads who worked for the firm could – and did. Given that Wylie was at the heart of this work, and that he displayed real sociological understanding of what the data was revealing, his account provides a useful, crystal-clear exposition of the power of psychographic profiling when it’s done right. And it suggests that electoral campaigning has now moved on to a different level.Oddly enough, Wylie first intuited this when, before joining SCL, he did a study for – of all people – the Lib Dems. Having spent a few weeks studying how the party went about electioneering, in late 2011, he explained to Nick Clegg and his team that “the data showed that Lib Dem voters were ideological, they were stubborn and they hated compromise. But the party has become the antithesis of these attributes when it joined a coalition government with the Tories. The party was composed of uncompromising supporters and yet it was operating in a government birthed out of compromising its principles. This type of compromise was a betrayal of Lib Dem voters’ ideals and it was bound to drive people out of the party.” He was never invited back.Brittany Kaiser was a different kind of naif – a well-educated, middle-class, well-meaning admirer of Obama who was interested in politics, and who desperately needed a job because her parents back in the US had lost their savings and were, basically, almost dependent on her. So, by a series of accidents she was introduced to Nix, who, to her surprise, hired her and taught her how to make PowerPoint presentations to pitch for clients.She turned out to be good at it and her book is a whirlwind account of three frenetic years during which SCL (and CA) appeared to thrive. She found herself seduced by the glamour (tea with Rebekah Mercer, meetings with prime ministers and billionaires, spats with Kellyanne Conway), enjoying being able to funnel money to her parents, alternately bullied and indulged by Nix, perpetually exhausted, hooked on the adrenaline but also needing the money.In the end, though, it got to her. At 2:30am on the night of Trump’s inauguration ball, dead drunk, dancing with Mercer she suddenly has an epiphany. “Bob and Bekah Mercer,” she thought, “now represented a new kind of force in American politics: wealthy donors with the money and the wherewithal to use their dollars in measurable, provable ways to make sure their expenditures produces some kind of return on investment.”The “return” was Brexit and Trump. And she was part of it. So her book is some kind of penance for that.• Mindf*ck: Inside Cambridge Analytica’s Plot to Break the World by Christopher Wylie is published by Profile (£20).

In March, after an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max crashed, killing 157 people, the plane was grounded worldwide.According to written testimony, Muilenburg will tell the Senate commerce committee: “We have learned and are still learning from these accidents, Mr Chairman. We know we made mistakes and got some things wrong.”Muilenburg’s testimony, made public on Monday, said the company had made improvements to the now-grounded 737 Max airplane “that will ensure that accidents like these never happen again”. He added: “We also know we can and must do better.”Muilenburg, who was stripped of his title as Boeing chairman by the board earlier this month, will also testify before the House of Representatives transportation and infrastructure committee on Wednesday.The grounding of the 737 Max has forced US airlines to cancel flights up to January and February and has also affected European carriers such as Ryanair, which cut 30,000 flights and will fly 5 million fewer passengers than planned next year. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not expected to approve the 737 Max’s use until December at the earliest.Muilenberg will tell the Senate he has flown on two demonstration flights testing the improvements made to the 737 Max. “When the 737 Max returns to service, it will be one of the safest airplanes ever to fly,” he said in his written testimony.He conceded getting the plane back in the air “has taken longer than we originally expected, but we’re committed to getting it right, and return-to-service timing is completely dependent on answering each and every question from the FAA”.He added “regulators should approve the return of the Max to the skies only after they have applied the most rigorous scrutiny, and are completely satisfied as to the plane’s safety. The flying public deserves nothing less.”Muilenberg also expressed “deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones” of those killed. He visited the Indonesian embassy in Washington on Monday to meet the country’s ambassador, offer condolences and pay respects to those lost on the flight.Indonesian investigators reported last week that problems with Boeing’s design, the airline’s maintenance of the jet and pilot errors contributed to the Lion Air crash. Muilenburg noted both crashes involved the repeated activation of a flight control software function known as MCAS after it received faulty sensor input.Boeing’s development of that software has come under criticism from lawmakers and the company is adding safeguards to the system. Muilenburg said the changes would “eliminate the possibility of even extremely unlikely risks that are unrelated to the accident”.Boeing has admitted few mistakes since the two fatal crashes. Earlier this month, the FAA questioned why Boeing withheld instant messages from a former pilot for months that raised questions about MCAS.Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House panel, has one main question for Boeing at Wednesday’s hearing: “How the hell did this happen?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82f9e21beabb689e0608ff8cff5769ff2d87a4da/0_0_3433_2059/master/3433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe2eb790eb36ddafc8ec7aac015bc5a2","title":"what ivanka and jareds 10th anniversary can teach us all about relationships","story":"Their bash at Camp David was a celebration of the values the couple hold dear – from ruthless ambition to a passion for nepotismIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner are so cute it is criminal. Despite their hectic grifting schedules, the dedicated public servants always make time for each other. Over the weekend, they celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary with a party at Camp David, the president’s country retreat. White House officials have assured us that the bash was paid for by the happy couple and definitely not US taxpayers. Donald Trump has chimed in to say that he funded the celebration, so we can rest assured that no public money was wasted. Not that the TrumpKushners would dream of using the presidency for personal gain, of course.It is not clear why Javanka settled on Camp David. After all, the Trumps have a range of hotels at their disposal that, we have been told, are far superior. Trump even tried to host the next G7 summit at his golf course in Doral, near Miami, rather than the mountain hideaway a White House official justified this by saying Camp David is “miserable” and “way too small”. But perhaps Ivanka has learned that size doesn’t matter. Or maybe Doral was experiencing another bedbug outbreak. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach has also racked up a few health-code violations, such as the “accumulation of blackgreen mould-like substance” in an ice machine, which may have made it less than tempting.There were no paparazzi at the party, so we know little about what went down, but one imagines the pair were showered with gifts from the rich and powerful. Perfume from Putin, perhaps? Steak knives from Jared’s buddy Mohammed bin Salman? A golden shower head from their Russian business partners? A job as head of the World Bank from Papa? But the real gift is a decade of blissful marriage. Think what you like about Javanka the pair seem besotted with each other. In many ways, they are a valuable case study on what makes a relationship work.First, it is important to be with someone who supports your goals. Ivanka has gushed about the fact that the pair are equally ambitious. “I’m happy for him when he is in the office working late,” she told New York Magazine in 2009. “I know how good that feels when you sit down and return emails.” I know what she means. When I sit down late at night and press that little “reply” button, I get a rush of euphoria.Also critical is ensuring you are clear on your roles. In a 2015 Vogue interview, Jared noted that Ivanka is “the CEO of our household, whereas I’m more on the board of directors”. That may not sound romantic, but it is extremely practical. In fact, I am going to use that line to get out of doing the washing-up. “Sweetie, as CEO of this apartment, the dishes fall under your domain. As executive chairwoman, I simply advise on optimal soap placement.”Healthy relationships are about compromise, too. If Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury is to be believed, the couple have made a deal that, once Daddy is out of office, Ivanka gets first dibs at being president. Which is big of Jared, really people may accuse his property companies of being morally bankrupt slumlords, but at least he is a feminist! And it is not just women’s empowerment on which the two agree they share strong family values. They are both keen on nepotism.So, good luck to the couple. They deserve each other. May their 11th anniversary be just as wonderful. I believe the traditional gift is steel, isn’t it? Perhaps their next venue can be somewhere with steel bars."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98ab27e7a6c9425d16ea5b2909fecfd0000a97fe/123_145_2158_1380/master/2158.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3bed694a8245189a0b9157c30e23b1df 1400w","title":"bus sized fatberg cleared from london sewer","story":"Blockage in Greenwich prompts Thames Water to reissue warning about waste disposalA 40-tonne fatberg the size of a double-decker bus has been cleared from a London sewer by Thames Water engineers who pulled out some of it by hand.The mass of fat, grease and other materials that weighed the same as three red buses, was discovered earlier this year clogging up a sewer in Greenwich, the water company said.Fatbergs are formed when fat, oil and grease are poured down sinks and drains and combine with items that should not be flushed down the toilet, such as unflushable wet wipes, nappies and cotton buds.Thames Water’s network protection team has been visiting food establishments in the area, to make sure they are not putting fat, grease and oil down their sinks and that fat traps are installed and working.Matt Rimmer, Thames Water’s head of waste networks, said: “This was a massive and disgusting blockage that took a great deal of effort and teamwork to clear and get the sewer working well again.“I’m happy that our team was able to get down and work hard to quickly to clear the fatberg before it could cause problems for our customers and the environment.“We’d urge everyone to help fight the fatberg by only flushing the 3Ps – pee, poo and paper – as well as disposing of fat and oils in the bin, not the sink.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7922c72e7ee18b8db70fb77dc9f16995a19340fa/0_0_5472_3078/master/5472.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c379790112b870fda7a643833739a066 1010w","title":"the guardians climate pledge 2019","story":"We want the  to play a leading role in reporting on the environmental catastrophe.

However, the second will be suspended during a probationary period of two years.The sanction means Bulgaria’s qualifier against the Czech Republic on 17 November will be played behind closed doors, while they have also been ordered to display a banner with the words “No to Racism” with the Uefa logo on it.Fare, which has had a partnership with Uefa since 2001 and is described as the governing body’s “social responsibility partner”, said in a statement: “We welcome the speed of this decision but we are disappointed that Bulgaria will not be expelled from the Euro 2020 qualifying competition given their previous record and obvious inability to deal with the problems they face.“We think that the evidence and circumstances of this match would have justified European football being given a stronger signal on the need to tackle racism. Obtaining justice for racist acts is not easy in any setting it is clear that football is no exception.“We will be in touch with Uefa to explore options and maintain that Bulgaria and others in the same situation fundamentally reappraise how they deal with racism.”The BFU was fined a further €10,000 for disturbances during a national anthem, with England ordered to pay €5,000 for the same offence.A spokesman for the FA said: “We sincerely hope the disgraceful scenes in Sofia are never repeated. Our priority remains our players, support team and fans and we will do all we can to ensure they never have to endure such circumstances again. While we acknowledge Uefa’s ruling today, a huge challenge still exists around racism and discrimination in society. Football has its part to play, and must do so, but it is for all to recognise the seriousness of the problem.“While those responsible for such deplorable behaviour at home or abroad need to be held to account, we should not lose sight of the importance of education programmes in finding a long-term solution. That has to be the way forward to help address the root cause of such disgusting behaviour. We are ready to build on our work with Uefa, Kick It Out and the FARE network in any positive way we can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dba98d78d398f2d905a7912ed33df5033fe9a24/92_35_1919_1150/master/1919.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=229701943c137a26cebd83e1ec19f19b","title":"david squires on wheres mesut ozil arsenal","story":"Our resident cartoonist invites you to try and find the lesser-spotted Arsenal playmaker amid the chaos at the Emirates Stadium"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2390b2e17e5e050d68a14ce1ad3e9edef9f40599/0_0_4820_2893/master/4820.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d76ea79181f34a7f6c46d603125d0d9f","title":"has your relationship been affected by brexit divisions","story":"We want to hear from couples whose opposing views on Brexit have impacted their relationship.The EU has agreed to Boris Johnson’s request for a Brexit extension to 31 January 2020 with the option for the UK to leave earlier if a deal is ratified.The agreement has cleared the way for a general election, with the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party pledging to back one on 9 December if no deal on 31 October is “taken off the table”.

I loved all his designs and when he showed me this dress, I thought it was the perfect thing to wear for my 21st birthday party. It’s amazing that it has become so iconic everybody wants to wear it. I feel proud every time I see someone wearing a version of this look. When I moved to New York, I would always wear these outfits that stood out – no one was dressing that way – and now I see them everywhere. I love being a fashionista, it’s amazing to start trends and to see my picture on moodboards.Everything that Macdonald makes looks like it would be uncomfortable because it’s so intricate and crystalised, but his pieces are of such amazing quality that they are easy to wear. I love that he designs clothes that make you feel confident and beautiful.Growing up, I always had my own sense of style. I loved being unique and original and coming up with my own trends. I love the way Kate Moss and Victoria Beckham dress – they always look so chic and stylish. When I go to a party, I love to be glamorous and go all out I like to sparkle and feel amazing. However, my everyday wear is very comfortable. I love Juicy Couture’s velour tracksuits I probably own 100 of them in every colour. That’s my uniform when I’m chilling at home or going to the beach – anything that doesn’t involve a red carpet.I do have a signature look – I love pink and I love sparkles – but my style has changed over the years. I have been really influenced by my sister Nicky, whose style has always been the complete opposite of mine. I’ve learned to tone it down a little bit, be a little bit more understated sometimes. But it depends on the situation I’m a chameleon. I can show up in a Chanel suit, looking like a businesswoman, but if I’m at a party or Halloween or Burning Man, then I’m going all out.Paris Hilton’s 25th fragrance, Electrify, is available in the US and is coming to Europe in January 2020.

But I think my attention  was a bit short for academic life, so I started writing science stories for newspapers. My first staff job was at BBC Tomorrow’s World magazine, then BBC News Online. I went to New Scientist next and then the Financial Times. In 2008, I was delighted to be hired by the , which was – and is! – my favourite paper.How has awareness of the climate crisis changed in the last decade? What do you think the big milestones have been? When I joined the , concern about the climate crisis was running high, following a landmark report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Al Gore’s film, An Inconvenient Truth – the IPCC and Gore went on to win the Nobel peace prize. But it was seen as a future problem. The transformative moment was meant to come at the 2009 UN climate change conference in Copenhagen. But it didn’t happen and after that the impacts of the global financial crisis grabbed all the attention. It wasn’t until 2015, by which time the role of human activities in driving climate change was undeniable, that a big step forward was taken with the Paris deal. How has your role in covering the environment changed in that time? has always taken the environment very seriously. In the decade I have been here, the team has expanded. But the basic approach has largely stayed the same – environmental issues affect everything, so should feature across all our coverage: reporting, exposing and holding to account. Today, the climate crisis is here, evident in more frequent and more severe extreme weather and climate change deniers have been relegated to the far fringes. With the global youth climate strikes inspired by Greta Thunberg and the Extinction Rebellion protests, 2019 feels like a new chapter. Those who have campaigned for decades are feeling hopeful. What would you say are the most important environmental issues?The climate emergency is the best known, and it will take systemic change to beat it. But the annihilation of wildlife and the destruction of nature is just as crucial in my view – we depend on the natural world for almost everything. The huge scale of the losses – from forests to insects to marine life – has only really become widely reported in the last few years. Pollution is the third issue, particularly the toxic air that causes millions of early deaths every year. Air is actually getting cleaner in some rich nations, but the understanding of how damaging it is – on everything from intelligence to miscarriages – is only really emerging now. Chemical pollution is also a serious global problem, from fertiliser to pesticides to PCBsWhat frustrates you about how these issues are sometimes be covered?One thing is the charge of hypocrisy that is often levelled at environment campaigners because they have a TV or something. Just because you have to live in the world as it is today doesn’t mean you can’t campaign to make it a better place tomorrow. But I think hypocrisy is the attack made by people who know they’ve lost the real argument.Has your work influencedinformed the way you live your life?Yes. It’s impossible to write about it every day and not act. I am vegan at home and whenever I can elsewhere. My home is fully insulated and my energy supplier is renewable. I rarely fly for holidays – one short haul flight in the last couple of years – and usually go to Ireland by ferry to surf. I’ve also cycled to work for about 13 years now – it’s cheap, fast and healthy. Being green is often worthwhile for many reasons.What would you say to readers who want to tackle the environmental crisis?The big shifts will be driven by the governments we elect (in democracies) and the companies to which we give our custom. Demanding urgent action from those leaders is vital. But personal action is also important, in itself and as an encouragement to others. The biggest action, according to scientists, is having fewer children, but that of course is a deeply personal and complex choice. Flying less and eating less meat and dairy also make big cuts in your impact, as does driving fewer petrol-powered miles and insulating your home.How can we build on the urgency we’ve seen from many campaigners in 2019 and keep the spotlight fixed firmly on the big changes we need?We are in a race against time and it’s not at all certain that we are going to win. We understand the problems and what we have to do, more or less, but the pace of action is far too slow. Putting pressure on politicians and business leaders is key – giving them a strong reason to move faster. The good news is that many solutions gain their own momentum once started. In many places, solar and wind power is now the cheapest electricity, and electric cars are the cheapest to own. But there are still big problems to solve, including agriculture and aviation. The young people involved in the climate strikes will be running the world in the not-too-distant future. But we have to make sure we are still in the race by then.What have been the highlights of your reporting at the  so far? What has made you most proud?I have written nearly 2,000 stories for the , and I’d hope most of them have played a part in building awareness of environmental issues. It’s usually hard to know how much impact stories have behind the scenes, but the restoration of slashed flood defence funding in England followed a lot of reporting by me, as did the EU ban on neonicotinoid pesticides, which harm bees. The recent resignation of the executive director of the UN environment programme also followed a string of my stories, which was a good example of the  holding power to account. The environment team get a lot of positive feedback from readers, scientists and policymakers, which is very heartening. One prominent scientist recently told me: “Thank God for the !”What is the area within your work and reporting expertise that you feel most passionately about?Usually the story I’m working on right now. But in recent years I’ve done a lot on pesticides, insects, the impact of livestock, microplastics and harmful subsidies. And badgers. I’ve written a lot about the cull in England. One of my editors here said I had “made the  the paper of choice for small mammals”, which may or may not have been a compliment.What about the highs and lows of doing the job?Often, this is the best job in the world. I’ve been fortunate to see a lot of the Earth’s natural beauty. I’ve tracked forest elephants in Gabon, been swimming with giant mantas in the Males and walked through extraordinary landscapes high in the Andes. On the other hand, almost every day I have to report more destruction and degradation of the environment. The most heartbreaking story I have covered is the poisoning of children with lead in a former mining town in Zambia. But I was glad to be able to expose it at least.What’s next for you and the team?The next 12 months are going to be absolutely pivotal for the world. There’s a major UN bioersity conference in China next year – the targets set a decade ago have been woefully missed. The UN climate summit in Glasgow, UK, in 2020 will also be vital – nations are going to have to make big increases in the carbon cuts they pledge if we are to get anywhere near the 1.5C temperature rise seen as a safety limit. And we’ll be reporting day in, day out, across the world holding nations and companies to account for the environment and for social justice.What makes the  unique?John Vidal, my brilliant predecessor as environment editor, says: “Environment is the world and everything in it”, and I think the issue now permeates all the newspaper’s coverage. That is because the  has always taken the issue seriously, with full support from the top and the resources to match. Our readers really care too, and they tell us. I’d guess there aren’t many places where all that is the case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90fd4fc3a89820f9e2da308468a8ca3dfd36815a/0_208_3937_2363/master/3937.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c36abafa2bca7dcb31ae7fc7cf88e785","title":"downing street signals compromise on potential general election date","story":"Jeremy Corbyn confirms party will vote for bill seeking December pollJeremy Corbyn has announced that Labour is ready to back a general election now that the EU has granted a three-month Brexit delay, making a pre-Christmas poll all but certain.With the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party preparing to support a one-line bill tabled by Boris Johnson’s government later on Tuesday, triggering an early poll, Corbyn said his party would also vote for it.The Labour leader told the shadow cabinet: “I have consistently said that we are ready for an election and our support is subject to a no-deal Brexit being off the table.“We have now heard from the EU that the extension of article 50 to 31 January has been confirmed, so for the next three months, our condition of taking no deal off the table has now been met.“We will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen.”Corbyn’s party abstained on Monday when Johnson tabled a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA) to call for an election, with the shadow cabinet split over the wisdom of an early poll.The Labour leader and his close allies have been keen to hit the campaign trail, despite the reticence of his chief whip, Nick Brown, and other key figures.The Labour campaign group Momentum tweeted: “Labour are officially backing an election. This is the opportunity of a lifetime to put an end to the shambolic mess the Tories have made and return hope to millions. Let’s do this.”Corbyn gave a televised statement at Labour HQ, with his shadow cabinet applauding behind him. “I’m absolutely looking forward to going to every part of the country with my wonderful shadow cabinet team here and all the fantastic Labour activists to give a message of hope where there isn’t one with this government,” he said.The exact date for a general election remains unclear. The government’s bill names 12 December, but the Lib Dems and SNP have objected to that date, and Downing Street said on Tuesday it would be willing to accept 11 as a compromise.A Downing Street spokesman said the only unacceptable date for the government would be the original Lib Dem-SNP proposal of 9 December.This would mean parliament being dissolved on Friday to allow 25 working days between dissolution and polling, he said, making it “very difficult” for both the election bill and a bill on budgets for the suspended Northern Ireland assembly to be passed and get royal assent.Also, 9 December is a Monday, meaning election preparations would take place during the preceding weekend, which would be logistically difficult and costly, he added.The spokesman said the government could not accept amendments extending the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds or EU nationals, saying longstanding convention dictates that changes to the franchise only happen after extensive consultation.Adding younger voters would be “administratively impossible to deliver in the time available”, he said, warning also that adding EU nationals would bring “administrative chaos”.Labour is expected to support efforts to amend the bill to bring forward the date, and also to lower the voting age and allow EU citizens to vote. But Corbyn’s statement suggests the party will still support an election, even if those amendments fall.A Lib Dem source said the party would be willing to consider the 11 December date. The SNP said no decision had yet been taken.The law requires there be at least 25 working days (five weeks) between calling an election and polling day. That realistically leaves only three Thursdays when the UK could have an election this year, with 12 December being Boris Johnson\u0027s preferred option. However, Monday 9 December has also emerged as a possible alternative.Any later seems unlikely as it will be seen as an unwelcome intrusion into the festive season - and difficult to organise, as many of the venues needed for polling stations will be busy with Christmas and holiday events.The prime minister has been seeking to trigger an early poll since last week, when MPs refused to accept the government’s fast-track timetable for scrutinising his Brexit deal.﻿Over the weekend, the Lib Dems and the SNP had said they would table a one-line bill seeking to trigger a 9 December election, which would only require a simple majority of MPs to pass.They said that date was calculated to prevent Johnson bringing his Brexit deal back to parliament, and to avoid students being disenfranchised, as the Christmas break will not yet have begun at most universities.﻿After his motion fell on Monday, Johnson said he would table a similar bill himself.“Across the country, there is a widespread view that this parliament has run its course, and that is because I simply do not believe that this house is capable of delivering on the priorities of the people, whether that means Brexit or anything else,” he told MPs.The leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, then made a verbal commitment in the house not to bring back the withdrawal agreement bill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21d57dac1e4990db1731ac5124258ef204b1a3bb/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=001b71f6bb84d63b9d8056ebab5163ba","title":"lib dem mp heidi allen stand down next general election","story":"Ex-Tory says ‘nastiness and intimidation’ she has endured behind decision to quit politicsThe Liberal Democrat MP Heidi Allen will not stand at the next general election, citing the “nastiness and intimidation” she has endured as a politician as being behind her decision to quit.The former Tory, who defected to Change UK before joining the Lib Dems on 7 October, said in a letter to her constituents in South Cambridgeshire: “I am exhausted by the invasion into my privacy and the nastiness and intimidation that has become commonplace. Nobody in any job should have to put up with threats, aggressive emails, being shouted at in the street, sworn at on social media, nor have to install panic alarms at home.“Of course public scrutiny is to be expected, but lines are all too regularly crossed and the effect is utterly dehumanising. I have reluctantly come to the decision that I will not re-stand when the next general election comes.“I am heartbroken, but I know it is the right decision because I am no longer delivering the change that drove me into politics in the first place.”The 44-year-old defected to the fledgling political organisation Change UK in February alongside her fellow Tories Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston. She had been a longstanding critic of austerity and other Tory welfare policies since her election in 2015 and was a vocal part of the pro-remain faction within the party.When Change UK became an official political party she acted as leader but after failing to win any seats at the European elections, splits started to emerge over the party’s future direction. She quit in June and sat as an independent until October after months of speculation she would join the Lib Dems.In her letter she said that until the next general election she would carry on her work with the Unite to Remain initiative she set up to help foster electoral pacts between remain parties.She has previously said the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection result, which resulted in the Tory MP Chris Davies being ousted in favour of the Lib Dems’ Jane Dodds, was in part down to her work in brokering a pact under which the Greens and Plaid Cymru stood down.Ending her letter, she said she hoped the next person to take over the South Cambridgeshire constituency – considered a safe Tory seat – would be a Lib Dem."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fa73cf83affe5b2e1b15f9538f45d6607b7271e/0_1809_4836_2901/master/4836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5aa74cf7a99846a21da34666f50e6d5","title":"margaret hodge reselected by local labour party","story":"MP for Barking in east London has led criticism of party’s handling of antisemitismDame Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and prominent critic of Jeremy Corbyn, has been reselected by her local party to run again for the east London seat of Barking.A reselection contest was triggered last month in the constituency of the veteran MP, who has led criticism of the party’s handling of antisemitism among members.On Monday night, she tweeted a picture of herself surrounded by colleagues, with a one-word message: “Victory!”Her fellow Labour backbencher Ruth Smeeth raised a point of order in the House of Commons on Monday to announce that Hodge had been reselected.Smeeth, the parliamentary chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, said: “I just want to put on record the fact that Margaret Hodge, the honourable (member) for Barking, has been reselected this evening, against an appalling attack by members of our party and I am delighted she remains a Labour candidate at the next general election.”The move by activists to trigger her reselection was described last month by the Jewish Labour Movement as a shameful moment for the party, while Labour’s former deputy leader, Harriet Harman, said she was “dismayed more than I can say”.The Board of Deputies of British Jews congratulated Hodge on her “emphatic reselection”, adding in a statement: “Trolls who opposed her reckoned without Margaret’s strength and popularity. Not lost on anyone that Labour’s so-called ‘anti-racist’ leader missing in action as his drones tried to force out another Jewish MP.”Hodge’s reselection was also welcomed on Tuesday morning by the Labour MP for Ilford North, Wes Streeting, who tweeted: “It is disappointing that ideological dogma and, worse still, self-interested personal ambition from some quarters, saw her triggered in the first place.”Hodge, a former minister and chair of the public accounts committee, saw off a challenge to her seat in 2010 by the far-right British National party at a time when it had been forecast to make gains.She was the second Labour MP to be “triggered” through the party’s new ballot procedures that make it easier for local members to force a contest.Diana Johnson was reselected last week as the party’s parliamentary candidate for Kingston upon Hull North."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eefc17e67555b201f66abe6883c501ca0344162/0_0_3552_2132/master/3552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00d5c7fd125afeb97392aaa48416a887","title":"peoples vote standoff escalates as staff confront chairman","story":"Roland Rudd has sacked two executives and is planning raft of new appointmentsThe standoff at People’s Vote has escalated after about 40 staff confronted the campaign’s chairman, Roland Rudd, who has sacked two senior executives and is planning to make a number of new appointments later on Tuesday.The bulk of staff working on the campaign for a second referendum initially defied a summons from Rudd after he fired James McGrory as campaign director and Tom Baldwin as media director over the weekend.The staff had believed they were to meet Rudd, a City PR firm boss, in their Millbank offices in London on Tuesday morning, with McGrory and Baldwin having vowed to turn up to work as usual.However, Rudd changed the location to the Hilton hotel next door and staff supportive of the sacked executives initially declined to attend. They later moved en masse to the Hilton, where security guards denied entry to Baldwin and McGrory.In a letter sent to Rudd on Monday night, 40 staff told him: “As the staff of the People’s Vote campaign, we demand you allow us to continue with our work under the leadership of James and Tom. This campaign has always been about trusting the people. If you want us to succeed, you must trust us now.”It added: “You claim to be a part of this campaign, saying you’re in and out of our office all the time. This just isn’t true. If you were, you would understand just how damaging your course of action is to People’s Vote supporters all over the country.“We all wanted to meet with you this morning to explain how we felt. Many of us are worried about our jobs and the future of our campaign. We were disappointed and angry you cancelled the meeting minutes before it was supposed to start, yet still made time to do various press interviews.”A People’s Vote source said Rudd had not wanted to be “ambushed” at the Millbank offices by people prepared to film him, but that he would be waiting with tea and coffee for anyone who wanted to discuss the management changes. They said the Hilton meeting room was used regularly and the staff had been issued with “direct orders from the chief executive and chairman” to attend.It is understood Rudd and his new chief executive, Patrick Heneghan, will announce staff appointments later on Tuesday.Rudd’s concerns about the management of the organisation were fuelled by a report from OC\u0026ampC Strategy Consultants. In the report, quotes from those who worked in the campaign included: “There are dozens of people who have not done a full day of work in weeks. You end up getting shouted at in a meeting so you just go home.”Another read: “It’s a completely unworkable, dysfunctional campaign at the moment. I have never been part of one that has so little accountability.”On the other side, some senior People’s Vote figures supportive of McGrory and Baldwin said the dysfunctional structure was a result of Rudd’s control over the campaign through its parent organisation, Open Britain.One board member disputed the idea that Rudd had been trying to improve its governance by merging it with other pro-European organisations, saying this had been the idea of the campaign’s management.They pointed to an email to Rudd from August with four People’s Vote constituent organisations saying they wanted a “shared ownership of the campaign across all the organisations involved and accountability to its members”, and rejecting Rudd’s “proposal for a new campaign controlled by Open Britain” as unacceptable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32b1b4fff7f294cc9e093f9a16ab0ef31cf14ad5/0_359_3831_2298/master/3831.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74968e4a36ed82988296d3636bd09578","title":"uk election date party wants why matter","story":"Everything you need to know about when a general election is likely to take placeA December general election now looks all but certain, after Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would be prepared to support Boris Johnson’s latest effort to trigger an early poll.The prime minister wants an election on Thursday 12 December, with a possible compromise date of 11 December. He originally proposed 12 December, which would have allowed a few more days for MPs to debate his withdrawal agreement bill, and tabled a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.That plan failed to win the backing of the required two-thirds of MPs in the House of Commons on Monday night, with Labour abstaining, but Johnson immediately announced he would table a one-line bill, again calling for a 12 December election.This would require a simple majority to pass, and echoes a plan put forward by the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party at the weekend, though they preferred a 9 December date.Corbyn’s party has agonised about whether to support a pre-Christmas poll. The Labour leader has been keen to hit the campaign trail, but some members of the shadow cabinet were very reluctant.Some had hoped a second referendum could have been secured first, while others would have liked to see Johnson’s Brexit deal debated and agreed, to allow Labour to focus on domestic policies during a campaign.But Corbyn eventually prevailed and Labour will now back a December election.Students may have broken up for Christmas by 12 December and it could be harder to get this cohort to vote if they are travelling between two locations. Corbyn brought this point up with Johnson at the dispatch box on Monday night and was heckled by Conservative MPs.Daylight hours are reduced and in Scotland it is dark at 4pm, or earlier on some of the islands. Some MPs say they are reluctant to go out campaigning in the cold and dark.The Conservatives say they do not want MPs to try to amend it and risk the bill being stuck in endless parliamentary gridlock.Some of Johnson’s advisers, particularly those who are veterans of the Vote Leave campaign, have been pressing for an early poll, hoping they can capitalise on the prime minister’s success in securing a deal with the EU and Labour’s discomfort about its Brexit stance.The Lib Dems and the SNP proposed an election on Monday 9 December to ensure the government had no time to bring its Brexit deal back. They have also warned about the risk of students being disenfranchised.The Lib Dem MP Chuka Umunna said the party was not prepared to accept the 12 December proposal. “If you have the 12th, it presents an opportunity for the government to get their withdrawal agreement bill through,” he said.“The reason the 9th is preferable is because it would stop them from bringing forward their withdrawal bill and completing its passage through the Commons.”The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said the date was not realistic as 25 working days were needed between the dissolution of parliament and polling day. Parliament would have to be dissolved on Friday, while also securing royal assent for the election bill, and passing a Northern Irish budget bill, which could be very difficult.The SNP and the Lib Dems were warmer on 10 or 11 December than 12 December. Labour has suggested it is likely to back efforts to amend the date, but the party is unlikely to withdraw support from the government’s election bill as a result."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cc78aef22617fef16661bc23ec5752c625bed8c/0_268_3872_2324/master/3872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=695f2fd326fb4cc994a6ec4064fe6c82","title":"tick borne encephalitis found uk first time","story":"Infected ticks are discovered in Norfolk and on Hampshire-Dorset borderA disease that can harm the brain, and which is spread to humans through tick bites, has been identified in the UK for the first time.Public Health England (PHE) confirmed the presence of the tick-borne encephalitis virus in Thetford Forest, Norfolk, and on the Hampshire-Dorset border.PHE said it believed a “handful” of infected ticks had been found in both locations, with only one highly probable case of tick-borne encephalitis so far.The health body said the risk was very low but it was investigating how common ticks with the virus might be.The small parasitic arachnids are becoming more common in parts of the UK, mainly due to increasing deer numbers. As well as living on deer, ticks can be found on cats, dogs and urban foxes.Ticks can also live in undergrowth, and latch on to humans when they walk through long grass.In addition to the encephalitis virus, the parasites can carry other diseases, including the more common Lyme disease.Dr Nick Phin, of PHE, said: “These are early research findings and indicate the need for further work. However, the risk to the general public is currently assessed to be very low.”Most people who catch the encephalitis virus will have no or only mild flu-like symptoms, but it can affect the brain and central nervous system and can sometimes be fatal. A vaccine is available privately for tick-borne encephalitis, which is already present in mainland Europe and parts of Asia.It is thought infected ticks may have arrived in the UK via migratory birds.“We are reminding people to be ‘tick aware’ and take tick precautions, particularly when visiting or working in areas with long grass such as woodlands, moorlands and parks,” Phin said.The NHS says tick bites can be prevented by covering skin while walking outdoors, using existing paths and nature trails, applying insect repellent and checking your clothes and hair after going for a walk.The illness begins with flu-like symptoms before progressing to a more serious second phase with meningitis and swelling of the brain in a quarter of cases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a095c4becc75b875ee687d10342aea4bdbf545d/103_295_1356_814/master/1356.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee4df6d4571c05d70feedc840d897169","title":"bangladesh captain shakib al hasan two year cricket corruption ban","story":"• ICC imposes ruling after player accepts anti-corruption charges• Charges relate to player not reporting approaches in Tri-SeriesThe Bangladesh captain, Shakib Al Hasan, has been banned from all cricket for two years, with 12 months suspended, by the International Cricket Council after accepting three anti-corruption charges.The charges cover not reporting approaches in relation to the Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe Tri-Series during 2018 as well as the Indian Premier League. The ICC confirmed if Shakib satisfied the conditions of the suspended part of the sanction, he would be free to resume international cricket in October 2020.“Like the majority of players and fans around the world, I want cricket to be a corruption-free sport and I am looking forward to working with the ICC ACU team to support their education programme and ensure young players don’t make the same mistake I did.”The ICC’s anti-corruption general manager, Alex Marshall, maintained responsibility rested with Shakib for not reporting the matter. “Shakib Al Hasan is a highly experienced international cricketer. He has attended many education sessions and knows his obligations under the code. He should have reported each of these approaches,” Marshall said in a statement.“Shakib has accepted his errors and co-operated fully with the investigation. He has offered to assist the Integrity Unit in future education, to help younger players to learn from his mistakes. I am happy to accept this offer.”Bangladesh are set to tour India in November, with an announcement of the Test squad yet to be confirmed. Shakib, 32, had missed Bangladesh training sessions over the past few days, with no official reason given for his absence.Shakib made his international debut in 2006 and has been a mainstay of the Bangladesh side ever since, making 338 appearances across all three formats. The Twenty20 squad was set to leave this week ahead of an opening match in Delhi on 3 November.The all-rounder was a star of the summer’s World Cup, finishing as the third-highest run-scorer in the competition with 606 runs – which lifted him up to ninth on the list of all-time runs scored at the tournament. He also became the only player in World Cup history to make 600 runs and claim 10 wickets in the same tournament.Assuming Shakib satisfies the suspended period criteria, his ban will end midway through next year’s T20 World Cup. The tournament in Australia begins on November 18 2020, with Shakib set to miss the first round matches as well as the opening games of the Super 12 round – if Bangladesh qualify from their group."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5614979453aa415e07c58c483d78d354a468039/0_376_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef0efaaca2e837142955e48a2a995c66","title":"former team sky doctor richard freeman to admit he told a lot of lies","story":"The former British Cycling and Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman will admit to telling “a lot of lies” and ordering the banned supplement testosterone, an independent medical tribunal heard on Tuesday.Speaking at the start of the rescheduled tribunal, which was postponed from February, Freeman’s representative, Mary O’Rourke QC, added that her client could previously “not bring himself to tell the truth, even to his lawyers”, before finally making a witness statement last month.Quoting Freeman, who was sat alongside her at the Manchester hearing, she added: “I am here now and this is the truth.”During a preliminary discussion held before the case formally opens, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester heard that Freeman planned to admit many of the charges against him, including ordering 30 sachets of Testoge in May 2011 to be sent to the Manchester velodrome – and then trying to cover his tracks.Freeman, who worked for Team Sky and British Cycling between 2009 and 2017 before resigning, is also expected to accept that he made false statements and failed to keep proper records. However he is expected to deny the testosterone was purchased for a rider - and instead maintain that it was for a member of staff, who he insists needed it for medical reasons. If Freeman loses the case, which has been brought by the General Medical Council, he faces losing his doctor’s licence.Much of the discussion on Tuesday morning centred on the charge that Freeman ordered the gel to be given to an athlete. Simon Jackson QC, for the General Medical Council said: “Your motive was to obtain testosterone to give to an athlete to improve an athlete’s performance.”However, Miss O’Rourke responded: “The burden is on the GMC to prove the motive they attribute. The GMC aren’t going to believe whatever he says, they are bent on saying it was doping.”Miss O’Rourke said the only GMC witness she required to cross examine was the former Team Sky coach Shane Sutton, who was also personal coach to Sir Bradley Wiggins. The GMC will call on an expert endocrinologist and will say that the member of staff had no need for the substance.The hearing, before Chair Neil Dalton, is expected to formally open later on Tuesday and is scheduled to run until 20 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80b3b0ed5eceeb892cbe6a99abf48545459d6a0b/0_151_5153_3091/master/5153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b08f968d5d98efe954240a22f724490c","title":"south africa inside knowledge england rugby world cup final","story":"South Africa are using the experience seven of their squad have of playing in the Gallagher Premiership to their advantage ahead of Saturday’s World Cup final against England, with particular attention being paid to the flankers Sam Underhill and Tom Curry who both played significant roles in last weekend’s demolition of New Zealand.Francois Louw has been providing the lowdown on his fellow Bath back rower Underhill while the scrum-half Faf de Klerk is Curry’s teammate at Sale. In addition, the hooker Schalk Brits, spent nine years at Saracens, the club that supplies half of England’s pack.Louw, who won the vital penalty that gave South Africa the position to overcome Wales five minutes from time in Sunday’s semi-final, will next week return to Bath for his ninth season at the club. He remembers Underhill joining from Ospreys in the summer of 2017.“My first impression of Sam was that he was a quiet, softly spoken guy,” he said. “He loves a beer, and I have joined him for many of those. He has developed massively as a player in two years and the way he has refined elements of his game came through last weekend, especially in defence.“He has the ability to stop momentum in the tackle and he packs presence at the breakdown where he poaches the ball. He is discovering what rugby is about and that there are so many different ways to play the game. Being the young guy he is, he gets exposed to different concepts and strategies and varied players around him.“He has adapted and he has a massive hunger to learn and grow as a player. That is one of the ultimate traits of a professional, the burning desire to better yourself continuously and he has been rightly rewarded by being given England’s seven shirt.”Curry and Underhill, whose three appearances in the Six Nations have all been as a replacement, did not start a match together until August this year when Ireland were beaten 57-15 at Twickenham. Billy Vunipola was the No 8 then and the trio have taken the field in all England’s five matches here.The South Africa head coach Rassie Erasmus said that while the feedback from his Premiership seven was valuable, it also worked in reverse and Curry will have given an insight into De Klerk, the Springboks’ tactical inspiration who likes to wind up opponents.“Tom has been amazing for England this year,” said the Springbok scrum-half. “I do not think he has missed a minute. He is always willing to work hard and he is up there with most of his stats. I know him pretty well and I have some stuff on him I can share with the group, which is a bit of a positive.”De Klerk reignited his international career after joining Sale. “Your understanding of the game changes because conditions in England mean the game is a lot more tactical,” he said. “As a scrum-half, that means being able to adjust, knowing when to attack and when to kick. I was not surprised at how England played against New Zealand or that they had the better of them tactically.”Louw has been used from the bench with South Africa’s captain, Siya Kolisi, occupying his position. “Siya plays with great courage and leads by example,” he said. “He has a lot of weight on his shoulders with regards to the make-up of our nation, where we have come from and where we are now. He is self-aware, knowing his strengths and weaknesses, and that is what you want in a leader.“It will be an immense battle on Saturday. We are at the final stage of the ultimate competition in our game. Both groups of players will have to dig really deep and front up, but afterwards I will have a good time with my five Bath colleagues who are in the England squad.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/576afec7e5223cd63aeb0666ebe5eb05ac085448/0_0_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43d13838a801a194f5608394122e2d1d","title":"wales gatland new zealand all blacks rugby world cup bronze playoff","story":"Wales will be running on emotion when their World Cup ends on Friday night against New Zealand in the bronze play-off at Tokyo Stadium. It will be the 124th and final Test overseen by Warren Gatland against the only country of the 16 the men in red have faced in his 12 years in charge he has not savoured victory against.Every time Wales face the All Blacks, the year 1953 – the last time New Zealand suffered defeat in the fixture – comes around. In the 1980s and 1990s, it resembled the scoreline, but under Gatland Wales have closed the gap considerably, although they have given a lot physically this tournament.“It is going to be an emotional night for everyone in the group,” said the Wales hooker, Elliot Dee. “We owe a lot to Warren and the coaches and we want to send them off well with a performance in what is a massive match for us.“Warren was the guy who gave me my chance at this level and filled me with belief. I dreamed as a kid about playing for Wales and I will always be grateful to him. The boys put in a massive shift at the weekend against South Africa in a hugely physical encounter, but playing the All Blacks is what you want.“The boys will leave nothing out there and I am sure it will be one hell of a Test match. Playing for third is not ideal, but we are hungry for the win and will be giving it our all knowing that beating them would be a huge achievement. We have got to turn disappointment into fire.”The last time Wales played New Zealand in the World Cup - in the group stage in 2003 in Sydney - they were coached by Steve Hansen who since 2011 has been in charge of the All Blacks. Like Gatland, it will be his final Test before stepping down and staying in Japan with Toyota Verblitz.“Beating New Zealand is the only thing we have not done as a group,” said Robin McBryde, the Wales forwards coach. “It would be good to get one over on Steve, someone I have the utmost respect for.“The players will not be under the pressure of having to win and I hope they go out there and enjoy it. I think the game will be opposite to the semi-final and we will enter the spirit of the occasion. The difference Warren has made is that there is expectancy now. Anyone playing Wales knows they are in for a tough game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0939b34485fde47aa2c70fa62c77beb0f9e98059/0_164_3894_2336/master/3894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7309137ba1da60ca2d4e71a24531889","title":"ashleigh barty v kiki bertens wta finals live","story":"Despite coming in as an alternate, Bertens can still qualify from this round robin Red Group. She will face Belinda Bencic on Thursday. If she wins both matches, she will qualify if two other players don’t win two matches.For Barty, that was quite a big setback after leading by a set and a break. However, she should take heart from recovering fairly well towards the end and losing in three sets is crucial in this format. Her third match against Petra Kvitova could be significant.Kvitova and Bencic are next on-court in Shenzhen where the Red Group should slowly take shape.Bertens has played a lot this year and she has won a lot. She has now won more than any other female player this year.Kiki Bertens defeats Ashleigh Barty 3-6 6-3 6-4: Kiki Bertens takes her first win over Ash Barty! Bertens double faulted to open the game, but then she found two excellent first serves before a couple of brilliant volleys at the net. She finished with a big serve and forehand to win. No nerves, no fear. This seemed like an impossible result with Barty leading 6-3 *3-2, but here we are. What a great fight.Final set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-6 4-5* Kiki Bertens: Barty has found some rhythm on her serve and is taking her forehand on well now. She holds to 15 after a rare volley error from Bertens, forcing the Dutchwoman to serve out the match. Let’s see if she has the nerve to see it out.Bertens reverted to what had put her in this situation, opening her service game with a brilliant low backhand volley on the first point and then moving in to seal the hold. Absolutely insane defence from Bertens on that final point - she was running from side to side, retrieved an overhead and then flipped the point on its head. Finally, she is one game away.Final set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-6 3-4* Kiki Bertens: Barty holds to love, exactly what she was looking for. Some good serving from Barty but Bertens is now starting to over-press with her forehand, going for big winners when dragged out wide. After losing seven games in a row, Barty is now on a three game run. That one break doesn’t look like much right now.Final set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-6 *2-4 Kiki Bertens: Suddenly, Ash Barty looks like Ash Barty again. Bertens had four game points to move to 5-1, but as the underdog double faulted, missed first serves and made nervous errors, Barty did what she does best: She moved around to attack her forehand when she could, and killed Bertens with her slice. Her slice drew two forehand errors from Bertens in the final two points. This match is far from over.The one highlight of the previous game was back to back passing shots from the two players. Check out this movement from Bertens.Final set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-6 1-4* Kiki Bertens: It took seven deuces, but Ashleigh Barty finally gets her first game after losing seven in a row. Even this one wasn’t pretty - it included her badly squandering a 40-0 lead, countless unforced errors and an attempted smash that seemed closer to the back fence than the court.But Barty is still fighting. She saved three break points and finished the game moving forward into the net, trying to find a way. She is still in this against an opponent she leads 5-0. Let’s see.Final set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-6 *0-4 Kiki Bertens: While much of the focus has been on Barty capitulating this set, Bertens deserves so much credit for this turnaround. She looked rightfully exhausted and far from any kind of competitive level early on, but she changed her tactics and it has worked so well. She is moving forward whenever possible and she sealed her eighth consecutive game with a brilliant pick up on her first volley before slamming a smash down to move ahead 4-0.Final set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-6 0-3* Kiki Bertens: Everything is terrible for Ash Barty right now but somehow things are only getting worse. After spraying more errors to fall down 0-40, she finally seems to connect with a great winning inside out forehand. Forget it. Bertens challenges and Hawk Eye says that it landed just wide. Bertens has now won seven games in a row and Barty has lost her serve 5 times in a row. None of this makes sense.This seemed completely impossible half an hour ago: “We’re just scratching our heads in the commentary booth,” says David Mercer on BT Sport.Final set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-6 *0-2 Kiki Bertens: Bertens consolidates her break with another solid hold. She connected with an absolutely huge forehand inside out winner at 30-30 that barely kissed the outside of the line. Then Barty helped her along by dumping a forehand into the net. Six games in a row. Some call that a ‘moral bagel’.Final set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-6 0-1* Kiki Bertens: Barty just can’t find any rhythm right now. A couple of unforced errors put her down 0-40, but then she found her first serve and saved all three break points with aplomb. From deuce, two more loose errors move Bertens ahead. That final forehand error was not even close. For a player who is known for her solid play, this is puzzling.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-6 Kiki Bertens: Well, well, well. Kiki Bertens seals her fourth consecutive game to take the number one into a third set. Suddenly, Bertens is standing further inside the court by smothering the Barty backhand and moving forward. Quite a puzzling set from Barty, who just couldn’t really find the court by the end. Let’s see if she can recover.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-5* Kiki Bertens: Suddenly, it’s Kiki Bertens who is looking more energised and fighting tooth and nail, her fightback underlined by brilliant counter drop shot at 30-15. But this has been very poor from the number one, who sends a slice wide to lose her third consecutive game. Bertens to serve for the set seemingly out of nowhere.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 *3-4 Kiki Bertens: This could be significant. Barty seemed to bounce back immediately with a couple of big forehands to move up 0-30, but a few great forays to the net from the Dutchwoman and she edges ahead.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 3-3* Kiki Bertens: Another puzzling game from Barty, who quickly fell down 15-40, recovered to deuce and then lost her serve anyway. Too many regulation errors from the Aussie and Bertens finally punished her, connecting with a couple of booming forehands before slamming an overhead away to take the break.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 *3-2 Kiki Bertens: Barty gets the break back immediately, forcing an error from Bertens with a heavy crosscourt forehand. Plenty of unforced errors before that though. We have been spoilt with some quality tennis in the opening two days, but this is a very choppy tennis match. Bertens very understandably doesn’t seem to have the energy while Barty hasn’t been able to punish her as thoroughly as she should.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 2-2* Kiki Bertens: Well then. Barty led 40-15 and seemed to be coasting towards consolidating the break, then she just seemed to lose focus. A series of errors was punctuated by the worst of all - a missed drive volley into the open court on break point. We’re back on serve.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 *2-1 Kiki Bertens: Well, that was not pretty from Kiki Bertens. After a stream of unforced errors, Bertens dumps a forehand into the net to hand Barty the break early in set two.Second set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 1-1* Kiki Bertens: Barty is looking good at the moment. Great, aggressive service game opened with a wicked forehand winner and closed with a nice foray to the net, sealed with a volley winner.This was a great hold, saving a couple of break points to put her mark down on the second set. After the second break point, Bertens found three consecutive first serves and was finally able to step into the court. Good stuff.First set: Ashleigh Barty 6-3 Kiki Bertens: Barty serves out the first set with aplomb. A pretty strange set in general. Barty lost her serve twice yet all three of her holds were to love. Bertens has looked quite lethargic aside from a few moments of excellence, while Barty finally cut out errors towards the end of the set and thrived.First set: Ashleigh Barty *5-3 Kiki Bertens: Bertens digs out her first hold of the day, but it wasn’t easy. Bertens moved to a 40-15 lead, only for Barty to fight back including whistling backhand winner. But she holds on to force Barty to serve out the set.First set: Ashleigh Barty 5-2* Kiki Bertens: Barty finally gets a handle on this first set, sealing a love service game with an ace.First set: Ashleigh Barty *4-2 Kiki Bertens: Another service game, another break. A brilliantly constructed point from Barty to break, forcing Bertens onto the run with an angled forehand, then slipping a backhand winner to the other corner. Plenty of errors from Bertens before that though.First set: Ashleigh Barty 3-2* Kiki Bertens: So much for good serving. We’re five games in with only one hold. That was a great return game from Bertens though, who connected with two incredible running forehand crosscourt winners. The first was a great passing shot as Barty approached and the second was a wicked angle that not even Barty, with her pace, could reach. We’re back on serve but who will hold?First set: Ashleigh Barty *3-1 Kiki Bertens: For all the attention on Barty’s slice backhand, the Aussie has been hitting more and more driven backhands this year. She pulls off a brilliant angled backhand passing shot to break again. There are some errors from both here but these are interesting, long exchanges with both women prodding the other and looking to inflict damage their heavy topspin forehands.Some more info on Osaka’s withdrawal here.First set: Ashleigh Barty 2-1* Kiki Bertens: Barty double faults on break point to give the break back. A couple of loose errors from her there but Bertens really put her foot down. Bertens started the game with a wicked running forehand passing shot and she threaded one of the best points of the event so far at deuce, with backhand slices, booming forehands and then a great pick-up at then net. Very nice.First set: Ashleigh Barty *2-0 Kiki Bertens: Bertens looked on her way to securing her own easy hold at 30-0, but then Barty came alive. A brilliant crosscourt forehand passing shot from the Aussie, then a well-constructed point finished with a slick volley. She already looks extremely sharp.First set: Ashleigh Barty 1-0 Kiki Bertens: Ashleigh Barty is the year end number one and she opens her account with an easy hold to love. Three first serves in, no problem.So, who will win?Barty leads their head-to-head 5-0, so on the surface not much more needs to be said. But all but one of their meetings have been extremely tight three setters. Their most recent match just a few weeks ago in Beijing was their toughest yet as Barty survived Bertens 6-3 3-6 7-6(7) in the semis, saving a match point. Bertens is so close but Barty still has the mental edge.Expect good serving as Bertens and Barty are two of the best servers in the game, respectively second and third on the ace list this year. Despite her strength and the viciousness of her strokes, Bertens is a clay courter at heart and these slow courts will give her time to build the points and choose her moments wisely. Barty will complicate things with her slice, forcing Bertens to generate a lot of pace herself. It will be interesting to see who controls the early exchanges.The biggest factor may be that Bertens’ schedule has been absolutely insane this autumn as she desperately tried to qualify to Shenzhen on merit. She played in the final of the WTA Elite Trophy in Zhuhai on Sunday. At some point she has to tire. Will it be today?Hello! Welcome to our coverage on day 3 of the WTA Finals in Shenzhen, where we have awoken to some disappointing news. We were supposed to have a huge battle between Roland Garros champion Ashleigh Barty and Australian Open champion Naomi Osaka, who have carried the top ranking between them since February, won their first matches on Sunday and played an excellent match a few weeks ago in the Beijing final, but Osaka has withdrawn from the WTA Finals this morning with a shoulder injury.In Osaka’s stead, alternate Kiki Bertens will take to the court against Barty. This remains a significant occasion as Barty will secure the year-end number one ranking once she steps onto the court today, a big achievement that reflects her consistency.This match-up is a particularly funny one. Bertens is most at home on clay and she arrived at Roland Garros with many people considering her a title favourite. Instead, she tearfully retired in the second round with a gastrointestinal illness, while Barty shocked the world by winning her first grand slam title on her “worst” surface. Despite that huge disappointment, this has been a good season for Bertens, her first full year in the top 10. Bertens arrives in Shenzhen having reached the final of the WTA Elite Trophy in Zhuhai last week and her best result of the year was the Madrid Premier Mandatory title in May, in which she bulldozed the field without dropping a set. As for Barty, we know how good this year has been. Aside from the highs of winning Roland Garros and Miami, the reason she is in position to confirm her year-end number one ranking is because she has been the most consistent player throughout the entire season, constantly going deep in tournaments even when she isn’t at her best. We’ll see if she can seal the ranking with a victory today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/437756d3cfc151da550321aa0ca5eab8cdcd48e3/0_39_1845_1107/master/1845.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71aeefc75b6c8717a03e8d845353b419","title":"broadway theatre new york american politics","story":"In an era of uncertainty and anxiety, New York theatre is shunning its obsession with private lives to throw a powerful spotlight on politicsIt used to be argued that British drama is driven by a fascination with public affairs and its American counterpart by a preoccupation with private lives. On the evidence of a week’s intensive theatregoing in New York, I would suggest that hoary generalisation has been blown to smithereens. At a time of potential impeachment, political polarisation and profound uncertainty, American theatre seems to be heavily engaged with the wider world.The most surprising – and controversial – new play I encountered was Will Arbery’s Heroes of the Fourth Turning at Playwrights Horizons. It offers a direct rebuttal to the stock charge that modern drama simply reflects the liberal assumptions of the theatregoing audience. Arbery writes about a group of deeply conservative Catholic friends who meet in Wyoming for the installation of a new president at their old college. The play neither caricatures nor cauterises these figures. It shows them to be passionate, articulate and as capable of quoting Hannah Arendt as Heidegger. At the same time, it suggests they are just as ided as any other section of modern American society.What is startling is their vehemence. The most extreme figure is Teresa who admires Steve Bannon and is excited by the idea of a war to save western civilisation. Her ex-lover, Justin, sees proximity to LGBT people as a threat to Christian children and advocates training in marksmanship for the college’s students. But Arbery also presents us with the alcoholic Kevin who feels spiritually empty, and the more rapturous Emily who worked for an anti-abortion women’s organisation helping domestic abuse victims. Everyone, it seems, loves Emily except her mother, the newly elected president, who turns up at this outdoor drinks party and argues for a return to religious orthodoxy.If anything unites these squabbling Catholics, it is their dislike of President Trump who is variously described as “a gross monster” and “chemotherapy”. But Arbery’s main point is that there seems to be a malaise affecting the whole of the United States of which these fervent rightwing Catholics are yet one more symptom. Arbery overdoes the symbolism – as with a noisily explosive generator that echoes the breaking string in Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard. But his play is robustly challenging and Danya Taymor’s production boasts a fine Edward Hopper-like set from Laura Jellinek and striking performances from Zoë Winters as the poster girl for the new apocalypse and Julia McDermott as the sickly Emily.If Arbery’s play offers little in the way of comfort, Soft Power at the Public Theater addresses the nation’s ills with the breezy bounce you expect in a musical. It has a strong pedigree in that the play and lyrics are by David Henry Hwang (M Butterfly) and the score by Jeanine Tesori (Caroline, or Change). The framework is complicated and derives from a street stabbing in which Hwang was the victim. But what we see is a fantasy musical that he imagines in his fevered post-op dreams and that offers a parodic inversion of The King and I. Instead of a British governess lecturing a Siamese monarch we see a Chinese film producer, Xue Xing, arriving in America and offering a lesson in civics and good governance to Hillary Clinton.There are some genuinely funny numbers, including one where Xue tries to teach the stiff-lipped Clinton (neatly played by Alyse Alan Louis) how to pronounce his name. As the all-Asian chorus line, bewigged to resemble standard Broadway hoofers, strut their stuff, we realise just how offensive it is when, as more often happens, occidental actors play oriental roles. But the virtue of the show is that it pins down the current American crisis with jaunty irony. “The ballot box has thrown your country into chaos,” claims the communist Xue. While Clinton agrees, she plangently sings that you have to stick with democracy. She even finally endorses a Chinese proverb that proclaims: “Good fortune will follow if we somehow survive.”While Hwang’s musical and Arbery’s play deal with the current crisis, Robert Schenkkan’s The Great Society at the Vivian Beaumont looks back to the historic past: specifically to the last years of Lyndon Johnson’s presidency from 1965 to 1968. What is immediately striking, in sharp contrast to today, is the moral purpose that drove LBJ and his success in getting, with the help of Republicans in the Senate, both the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act on to the statute book. But, as shown by Christopher Hampton’s 2013 play Appomattox – which has sadly never been seen in Britain – LBJ was one of the great tragic heroes of modern times. A progressive politician and genuine idealist, who got 104 bills through Congress, will always be defined by his disastrous escalation of the war in Vietnam. Brian Cox, who plays Johnson in Bill Rauch’s energetic production, doesn’t look much like the man himself but it is still a titanic performance that captures LBJ’s political guile and ingenuity as well as his descent from a great height.Not all New York plays are overtly political. I caught an intriguing work by Adam Rapp, The Sound Inside, about the odd relationship between Bella, a 53-year-old professor of creative writing at Yale, and a young student, Christopher, who has a passion for Dostoyevsky. Rapp keeps you on tenterhooks as to the real reason for the couple’s extra-curricular friendship and, in a highly literary play, makes a number of shrewd points. One is that fiction is, more often than not, camouflaged autobiography. Another is that, in today’s world, readers (and theatre audiences) crave elliptical conclusions. Mary-Louise Parker is brilliant as the self-contained, solitary Bella and Will Hochman suggests a dark undertow to her inquisitive student. I only hope that if David Cromer’s production makes it to London, as it surely will, it finds a more intimate space than Broadway’s Studio 54. But this is a fine play that, even if not directly about public affairs, proves that uncertainty is the defining condition of modern life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd665f6c87003dbb26297a66b48580b06fe2e6a5/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d4b868377347350780f73713052c126","title":"labour calls for halt to googles acquisition of fitbit","story":"Tom Watson urges Competition Authority to investigate ‘data grab’ by tech companyLabour has written to the competition regulator calling for Google’s reported acquisition of Fitbit to be halted, at least until a wider inquiry into anticompetitive practices in the tech sector is completed.According to Reuters, Google made an offer to purchase the fitness tracking company on Monday for an undisclosed price.Tom Watson, Labour’s shadow secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, has written to the Competition and Markets Authority to request it halt the acquisition pending a full investigation of its effect on the competitive landscape.“I have long been concerned about the data monopolies that dominate our tech market, including Google,” Watson writes. “These companies hold and gather an unprecedented amount of data on users which is then monetised through micro-targeting and advertising to amass huge profits and power. Meanwhile, the digital giants themselves remain unaccountable, unregulated, and see themselves as above the law. They have run rings around regulation for far too long.“This is not just a business deal, it’s a data grab – and that should worry us all. Any such proposal must be subjected to the most rigorous possible scrutiny and must be fully investigated by the CMA.”Watson specifically singles out the fact that Fitbit stores physical health data for users, who track their activity and exercise with the company’s range of connected wearable devices, as cause for concern.“If this acquisition were to proceed, Google could have information on how we sleep, when we move, what we eat, on our breathing and our heartbeats. This data could hardly be more sensitive, but as is Google’s business model, all this information could then be used to micro-targeting, advertising, and behaviour modification. The risk to consumers here is significant,” Watson writes.The CMA has already announced one market study into whether or not Facebook and Google dominate online platforms and digital advertising. Watson argues that, at a minimum, all acquisitions such as Fitbit should be paused “until the CMA’s market study is concluded and its recommendations are implemented”.Watson has also written to the Information Commissioner’s Office expressing concern over the data aspects of the merger, calling on Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, to assess whether it raises privacy concerns and feed that back to the CMA.Google has provided a fitness tracking service, Google Fit, since 2014, but the company has never offered its own hardware to go along with it, instead relying on third-parties such as Samsung to produce Android Wear smartwatches."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8402bb961cccd87a228d1918846d878eac9ed3f9/0_480_2140_1284/master/2140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1488d8bece814087164799bb43e31ad","title":"how smart tech can put us on track to sustainable travel","story":"People are willing to change their travel habits for the good of the environment. From travel apps and carbon calculators to free public transport, here’s how you can make a differenceIndustry experts believe that a nationwide transport revolution is required to mitigate the climate crisis, and that smart technology could transform the way we travel. Travel apps are making sustainable transport options more accessible to the growing number of people keen to change their travel plans to reduce their environmental impact.Tools include the calculator at EcoPassenger, which directly compares energy consumption and carbon emissions of planes, cars and trains for any journey. Meanwhile, Lime’s new electric bike and scooter sharing scheme is taking off in London and Milton Keynes, and Europe’s leading train and coach app, Trainline, is making greener travel more hassle-free for customers globally by investing in technology to help make train and coach travel across 45 countries more accessible. “Our long-term vision is to enable everyone to travel from A to B much faster and more efficiently, in a way that’s better for the environment,” says Clare Gilmartin, CEO of Trainline. “We use artificial intelligence and advanced mobile technology so that, via our app, customers can travel by train and coach seamlessly, with on-the-go access to real-time journey information, using digital tickets to skip queues and with access to clever features like BusyBot, which harnesses crowdsourced data to help people find a seat on a busy train. We believe smart tech has a crucial role to play in encouraging and enabling people to travel sustainably.”The government has invested £1.5bn in grants between 2015 and 2020 for electric plug-in vehicles and schemes to kickstart the rollout of charge-point infrastructure, while pledging that all new cars and vans should be zero-emission by 2040, according to its Road to Zero strategy. Childs insists this is not enough: “The only way we can make the scale of reductions we need fast enough is by having a revolution in transportation.”Lisbon has one of the world’s largest electric vehicle charging point networks, while Estonia and Luxembourg have introduced countrywide free public transport. “Free public transport is transformational, not only for the environment – it’s also socially progressive,” adds Childs. Trainline found that a quarter of young Brits would reduce time behind the wheel to be more sustainable, and Friends of the Earth is calling for the government to make bus travel free to under-30s to reduce the need for young people to buy cars and help people switch to public transport.By driving positive change through technology, travel apps help create a more sustainable and efficient transport infrastructure, enabling a smoother transition to lower carbon-impact travel, within the UK and beyond.Book travel in and across 45 countries today with Trainline, Europe’s leading train and coach app"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58c0f14c375f014dbb2e32b4cec28918b11daf77/227_320_4836_2902/master/4836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeeecb8be7305c2efcd9f68dd033bfb7","title":"rail adventures five scenic european journeys to savour","story":"With train travel often more sustainable than driving or flying, now’s the time to leave the car at home. Swap the road for the rails, as Nick Inman provides some of the best train trips in the UK and mainland EuropeRail’s sustainability credentials mean it’s a no-brainer to swap the stress of the airport and traffic jams for the more scenic and greener option. With Europe’s extensive rail network ready to take you directly from city centre to city centre or guide you through some of the best scenery on offer, forget flying or driving, hop on the train. You could stay in Britain and explore unfamiliar parts of the country you don’t normally get to see, or you could take the Eurostar from London to mainland Europe and connect with an international system of high-speed trains and quaint branch lines.Rail is convenient, competitively priced and environmentally friendly. It’s also a reminder that travel is as much about the journey as the destination. It allows you to slow down and think.What are you waiting for?Here are five routes – two at home, three abroad – to get you started. All can be booked through Trainline’s app or website.Glasgow to Mallaig via Fort WilliamIf you want to get kids used to travelling by train, take them north to see the magnificent curving viaduct of Glenfinnan, which is used to carry the Hogwarts Express in the Harry Potter films. The West Highland line is regularly described as one of the most scenic in the British Isles, if not the world (beating even the Trans-Siberian), being a procession of mouthwatering lochs, moors and mountains. From Mallaig you can take ferries to several of the islands of the Inner Hebrides.Getting to Glasgow: you have a choice of trains from London (or other mainline stations in Britain).Typical journey time: Glasgow to Mallaig, 5 hours 16 minutes direct.Nice (Provence, France) to Pisa (Tuscany, Italy)Steep wooded hills tumble into the sea all along the beautiful coast of Liguria from the French border near Ventimiglia to the ancient port city of Genoa and beyond. This trip makes a relaxing way to get to Tuscany along the Riviera. If you are tempted to break up the journey, you may want to visit the resorts of San Remo or Portofino, or one of the dramatically sited and colourful towns of the Cinque Terre.Getting to Nice: take the Eurostar and change at Paris Gare du NordParis Gare de Lyon.Typical journey time: 6 hours 30 minutes, with one or two changes at Ventimiglia andor Genova.Vienna to Klagenfurt via the Semmering PassThis trans-Alpine line was built in 1854 to link the capital of imperial Austria with the Mediterranean. It was a huge engineering achievement and set the standard for mountain railways, for which it has been declared a world heritage site. Take a seat on the left side of the train by preference. The views are superb as you cross the 895-metre (2,900 ft) Semmering Pass, the highlight of the journey. You can extend your trip via Villach to reach Venice: travelling from central to southern Europe in one exhilarating journey.To get to Vienna: take the Eurostar and change at Brussels and Frankfurt.Typical journey time: Vienna to Klagenfurt, 3 hours 55 minutes direct.Leeds to Carlisle via SettleIt has been described as the line that should never have been built, being a technical challenge that was financially ruinous and costly in the lives of navvies. When it was threatened with closure in the 1980s, the Settle-Carlisle line was rediscovered by train lovers, day-trippers and hill walkers and given a second life. Leaving industrial West Yorkshire, climb into the Yorkshire Dales national park via the Ribblehead viaduct to reach the highest mainline station in England, Dent, at an altitude of 350 metres (1,150 ft). Great views of the austere Pennines are guaranteed.Getting to Leeds: there are plenty of high-speed mainline trains from London.Typical journey time: Leeds to Carlisle, 2 hours 40 minutes direct.Cologne to MainzFancy a river cruise through the Rhine Gorge – only, by train? There are railway lines on both banks of the river, giving splendid views of the gorge, which stretches for 40 miles between Koblenz and Bingen. The east bank line is more scenic, but not as well-serviced as the western side, which has a wider choice of trains – so take the west-bank mainline through Bonn. Or, if you don’t mind taking a slightly more circuitous route, you could go down one and back up the other. Either way, en route are innumerable magnificent castles – whether real, mock or ruined – and pretty villages with half-timbered houses.To get to Cologne: take the Eurostar from London St Pancras and change at Brussels.Typical journey time: Cologne to Mainz, 1 hour 40 minutes.Journey times and ticket prices vary according to which particular options you choose.Ticket to rideIt is easy to book the train for your next adventure.

So other! So extraordinarily strange!” So said Sue Perkins as she walked across Tokyo’s most crowded zebra crossing in the opening sequence of her travelogue. But shouldn’t this all be more familiar by now?After all, BBC One’s Japan With Sue Perkins, which aired last month, was only the latest in a long run of British TV programmes inviting us to boggle at the east Asian country. These shows always feature a shot of the aforementioned Shibuya Crossing, items on AI and sumo wrestling, and a concerned interview with an undersexed young man (sometimes called otaku) andor an overexcited young woman (something to do with kawaii). Only rarely do they offer fresh insight.At least the upcoming Queer Eye: We’re in Japan! on Netflix and BBC Two’s drama GiriHaji have obeyed the most basic rule of making British TV about Japan: don’t name it after that slightly racist 1980s hit about masturbation. That’s where Channel 5’s Justin Lee Collins: Turning Japanese went wrong. Or rather, it was the first of many wrong turns in which the since-disgraced comic’s 2011 travelogue erred.TV’s other orientalist missteps are less daft, but more common. The premise of Queer Eye – five sophisticates makeover a sad-sack – puts Karamo Brown in danger of doing an accidental “Lawrence of Arabia” when he arrives in Tokyo. That is, updating the colonial yarn of the westerner who is eventually accepted by an alien community and then asserts his inherent superiority by embodying the culture better than the locals. Happily, Queer Eye has addressed that risk by including Kiko Mizuhara, a Japanese-American model and Tokyo resident as its guide.The illuminating presence of Mizuhara is, however, unusual. “British television programmes have a tendency to represent Japanese people as stereotypically odd or kooky, without explaining the cultural context,” says Professor Perry R Hinton, an expert in intercultural communication.This kind of othering reveals a narrow-mindedness. As Shinichi Adachi, the Japanese-British film-maker behind YouTube culinary series The Wagyu Show explains, Japanese culture isn’t particularly strange, just more accepting of humanity’s strangeness. “They respect people, even if they don’t understand them. People don’t really care if others have weird hobbies.”Another big contextual omission is Japanese self-awareness. A regular set-up in Perkins’s show involves her making wry observations while her hosts look on, blank-faced from the edge of the frame, presumably excluded from the joke by the language barrier. She’s not the only one. Similar interactions took place in No Sex Please, We’re Japanese (BBC Two, 2013), Joanna Lumley’s Japan (ITV, 2016), Adam and Joe Go Tokyo (BBC Three, 2003), and even in Jonathan Ross’s generally respectful Japanorama series (BBC ChoiceBBC Three, 2002-7).But Japan is in on the joke. Indeed, they’re the ones who cracked it in the first place. Hinton gives the gameshow Endurance as an example. First introduced to British audiences via Clive James on Television, then Tarrant on TV (1982-2006), it began a fascination with Japanese gameshows that has continued through Takeshi’s Castle and the controversial E4 spoof Banzai, which Guy Aoki of the Media Action Network for Asian-Americans described as “an Asian minstrel show”. Yet all this revelling in gameshow exotica was born out of a subtle mistranslation. Hinton points out that the word “endurance” has a particular connotation in Japanese culture, akin to “stiff upper lip”, with roots in the resilience required for post-second world war reconstruction. “Rather than Endurance representing Japanese otherness, it showed a confidence in being able to mock one’s own national character, similar to Monty Python’s Flying Circus,” says Hinton. The Japanese gameshow is as much an example of cultural similarity as it is of difference, but it’s the latter that British TV producers choose to emphasise.“To attract viewers, it’s understandable,” says Chiho Aikman, of the Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation in London, “but the reality of Japanese culture is quite different.” She suggests architecture, regional cuisine (“We don’t just eat sushi!”) and the spread of hate speech as topics that don’t get enough attention. Instead, shows about hikikomori (modern-day hermits) and 40-year-old virgins with huge hentai (mangaanime porn) collections give the impression that subcultures typify an entire nation. In truth, such selections often say more about the audience than they do about the subject. So, if anyone comes out of this looking like socially inadequate, culturally insular, sex-obsessed pervs, well, it’s not the Japanese, is it?Queer Eye: We’re in Japan! is available from Friday 1 November on Netflix"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/080acb96a49883a874b62a562f1bbfb7eaf67dce/0_331_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c5efaef316c60edf9593d48d6d08873","title":"syrian kurds baghdadi underpants dna test","story":"Syrian Democratic Forces also claim they played a key role in tracking down Baghdadi to a compound in northern Syria Syrian Kurds say they managed to place a spy in Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s inner circle who stole a pair of the Islamic State leader’s underpants to prove his identity and then helped guide US soldiers to his Syrian hideout.The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) claim they played a key role in tracking down Baghdadi to a compound in northern Syria where he was reportedly planning his escape over the nearby border into Turkey.Donald Trump has thus played down the role of the SDF, who fought the military campaign against Isis with US troops, but whom Trump abandoned earlier this month by ordering US troops to stand aside before a Turkish offensive against the Syrian Kurds.Trump has claimed credit for masterminding the operation that led to Baghdadi’s death, but according to the SDF version, his withdrawal of US forces led to a postponement of the operation.“More than a month ago, the decision was made to eliminate Al Baghdadi. However, the US withdrawal and the Turkish invasion prompted us to stop our special operations, including the pursuit of Al Baghdadi. The Turkish invasion caused a delay in the operation,” Can said.“Our intelligence source was involved in sending coordinates, directing the airdrop, participating in and making the operation a success until the last minute.”The SDF commander, General Mazloum Kobani, also referred to a SDF-run spy in Baghdadi’s entourage in interviews with US media on Monday.Asked about the SDF role in the operation in Idlib province late on Saturday night, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, General Mark Milley, gave a carefully-worded reply, saying he was “not going to comment on what may or may not have happened with the SDF” but stressing that the air operation and the soldiers sent into the compound were exclusively US special forces.Mazloum told NBC that the SDF agent was at the Baghdadi compound when the assault took place, that he had served as a security adviser to the Isis leader and that his betrayal was motivated by revenge.The husband of Baghdadi’s sister-in-law has emerged as another key figures earlier on in the hunt for the Isis leader. According to Iraqi intelligence officials, Muhammad Ali Sajid al-Zobaie led them to a desert tunnel on the Iraqi Syrian border, where items linked to the Isis leader were found. The Iraqis say they found a weapon, medical bags, religious books and a small handbag containing maps and hand-drawn locations inside the cache.From that starting point, the smuggler who proved central to the hunt was located, as was one of Baghdadi’s wives and a nephew. All three were co-opted, and they led Iraqis and Syrian Kurds who had then been enlisted by the CIA to northern Idlib province, near an area called Jebel al-Druze in the beginning of September.Baghdadi is thought to have not long been in the province and was regularly moving between a series of simple houses.In a Pentagon briefing Milley gave few new details about the Saturday raid on a compound near the Syrian-Turkish border which led to Baghdadi’s death when he detonated a suicide vest in a tunnel.“Baghdadi’s remains were then transported to a secure facility to confirm his identity with forensic DNA testing, and the disposal of his remains has been done, and is complete, and was handled appropriately,” Milley said. Another Pentagon official confirmed that Baghdadi’s body was buried at sea at an unnamed location, similar to the 2011 sea burial of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden after he was killed in a US special forces raid in Pakistan.He said that two men had been captured alive at the compound and were in US custody in an unspecified location.Milley said he could not confirm Trump’s claim that Baghdadi had been “whimpering and crying” as he fled US forces in a tunnel at the compound.“The president had planned a talk down to the unit and unit members,” the general said. “I don’t know what the source of that was, but I assume it was talking directly to unit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44230855e2fdd5281417b27ff37d81619ad8e309/0_166_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd934a4aa1721ca5772f8afb4c3326a5","title":"amelia bambridge koh rong fishing boats search focus cambodia","story":"Cambodian officials say six men have been interviewed about Briton’s disappearanceCambodian officials looking for a British woman missing on Koh Rong island are focusing their search on fishing boats and have interviewed six men about her disappearance.Amelia Bambridge, 21, from Sussex, was last seen at a beach party at about 3am on Thursday.

The owner of the only store in town keeps irregular hours, and in his absence leaves a container with coins and wrinkled bills on the counter. Residents take what they need and make their own change.The tiny island community in Canada’s easternmost province, Newfoundland and Labrador, is home to 54 year-round residents, and more in the summertime.Most families have been here for generations, subsisting on the once-booming fishing industry.But on 31 December, electricity and water will be switched off and ferry service discontinued. Little Bay Islands is the latest isolated village to agree to resettle on the mainland as part of the province’s community relocation policy, which offers government compensation to people who leave remote areas.Newfoundland and Labrador faces one of the most acute struggles in the country: a rapidly ageing population, spread over a vast area.Ted Grimes has lived all of his 70-odd years on Little Bay Islands. His parents and grandparents did too. But in early 2019, he – and everyone else – voted to resettle the community: he didn’t want to be abandoned along with the island. “I don’t really want to leave, no. But I had no other choice,” said Grimes in a reluctant phone interview.Instead, he will use his government cheque to resettle in a cottage in the town of Lewisporte (population 3,400), leaving behind a lifetime’s worth of mementos on the island. “The sentimental stuff, you take. Some of the stuff the kids and the grandkids gave us, you can’t throw it out,” said Grimes. “It’s gut-wrenching.”The town’s decline began in earnest in 1992 with the cod moratorium. To manage dwindling Atlantic cod stocks, the federal government plunged 30,000-plus people across the province into unemployment overnight.Little Bay Islands stuck it out longer than most by switching to snow crabs, but that industry eventually closed down too, back in 2009. Soon, only elderly people remained. The store shuttered, as did the school in 2018 after two consecutive years with no students. By New Year’s Day, Mike and Georgina Parsons – and their dog – will be the only permanent residents of Little Bay Islands. At 53 and 44 respectively, they are the island’s youngest full-time residents.They moved to the community a few years back, attracted to the idea of living off the grid in Mike’s hometown, and have spent the last couple of years preparing for a life of solitude on the edge of the Atlantic.As winter draws near residents have been slowly filing out, each weekend bringing more farewells. At least half the numbers in the phone directory have been disconnected. Many residents intend to return to their homes in the summers, but for others this may be goodbye.When everyone is gone, he and Georgina will rely on solar panels, a freshwater well, stockpiled food, a satellite connection and other off-grid features to live their secluded life on the edge of the Atlantic. There will be a few weeks each winter where Arctic ice chokes the bay, making it impossible to cross over to the mainland. Then, they will be completely cut off, left alone to witness the town’s fiery sunrises and the dead silence of starry winter nights."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03dfdd9c4f422ef04e885d7203eab23a24831e0d/47_349_4769_2862/master/4769.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4303173e722daef2061ee407904af82b","title":"paris urban shepherd photo essay","story":"Julie-Lou Dubreuil has been a shepherd for three years in Paris and its suburbs, and founded the Clinamen collective in the city. The photographer Abdulmonam Eassa spotted her flock in the French capital and went to her village to meet herJulie-Lou Dubreuil, 47, is of French origin and works as a shepherd in Paris and its suburbs. She joined a group of urban shepherds and then moved to the suburbs and founded the Clinamen collective.“We go to the border of Paris twice a month, to graze in the course. On a daily basis, the herd grazes an immense 400-hectare park in La Courneuve. And five days a month, they eat in the city on circuits of 9-15km, in an urban area north of Paris that extends from Aubervilliers to Garges-lès-Gonesse.”Dubreuil studied architectural engineering, as her father did, in her hometown of Bordeaux, but she did not finish her studies because of their difficult financial situation at the time. Dubreuil got a job as a field manager, building and renovating homes, and was the only woman in that line of work where she was living.“All our trips are under the control of the authorities. The goal is gradually to make room for the animal – whether wild or domestic – in the urban space.”She said she was not willing to continue with the field manager role after a few difficult experiences and had dreamed of finding something better.The idea of being a shepherd came to her mind while she was watching a herd of sheep. Dubreuil said she felt like she was facing a closed door and the sheep were telling her to open it.Dubreuil humbly describes her six years of being a shepherd, saying: “It was the sheep who taught me how to be a shepherd.” Those willing to learn must keep their eyes open “for the signs the animals communicate to you”.She added: “Many women are very shy, and I tell people there are thousands of women who are working in every sector, but they do not appreciate our capabilities as women. As always. I thought to myself, ‘Paris would appear quite pretty with sheep’.“Once, I was sad when I passed by an area under a bridge in Paris where migrants had set up camp. Usually, the sight of sheep in the streets brings a smile to people I pass by, but it did not happen with them. I thought happiness could at least pass momentarily through their minds when they see the sheep, but unfortunately it didn’t happen. I was very sad after, I kept wondering what life on this Earth did to them.”Dubreuil continued: “Generally, people are happy and especially children, because for most of them, it’s their first time in life to see real sheep. We occasionally pass by a group of snobbish people, who look down on us. However, I feel quite comfortable with my sheep in such fancy places – that is my little revenge against capitalism.”She comes to the city twice a month with her herd, and spends the rest of the time in her village in the countryside."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28dacc5d00d93a64ab25129c8b9358d2f3af5a85/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eed5174b5b30a6617af3be7fbc38e05e","title":"the women who broke the harvey weinstein story podcast","story":"When Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey began investigating Harvey Weinstein, they had no idea it would ignite a global reckoning on sexual harassment resulting in #MeToo.

Photograph: Supplied by Brian FarrellHe says it took him 10 minutes to realize the sinister nature of the attack and “then I thought about Kevin Lunney and his car being burnt and I realized ‘this is mad’.”The nightmare for the Kenny family began at their home in Aughavas, 11kms from Ballinamore, when they were awoken at 2.15am on Monday by what seemed to be “flashing lights” outside the front door.As flames from the burning car lit up the hall, his wife Helen raced to wake their three teenaged children and get them out of the house fearful that it might catch fire too.He said the family was “shocked, frightened, and amazed to be honest” when they realised the car was on fire.“But at the same time we are strong. We have come together and we are fine and we will not let it be the defining moment of anything. You don’t let anybody who comes in the middle of the night and does that to define anything about your life. That is the decision we all made”.Mr Kenny says he is proud of his family and how they are responding to this trauma.“One of my girls said that at least we are not trying to get into a container or get onto the back of a truck to find safety. We are safe”.Mr Kenny said someone was coming to look at installing security cameras and lights at the house.He said until now there was no even a gate on the property.“That is just the way we live”, he said, before adding that changes had to be made.The TD says he has no idea who is responsible and was at pains to state that, despite his differences with others in the community on the issue of asylum seekers in Ballinamore, he is not blaming any of his critics.“The only people who are responsible for this is the person or persons who did it”.Mr Kenny called for lessons must be learned from the situation in Ballinamore where he says people had legitimate concerns about the planned centre for asylum seekers.“ I do not want to be critical of people but there are lessons to be learned. I think it is very irresponsible , and very regrettable that people have been fired up”.Asked whether he thought the Ballinamore Community Group should now end their 24-hour protest at the apartment block earmarked for asylum seekers he said: “That is up to them. I certainly did not ask them to put it there.“If they are big enough to decide to do it, they should be big enough and have enough cop on to know what to do now”.He said the family spent Monday trying to powerwash burned rubber and plastic from their driveway and to come to terms with what had happened.“Then we pulled the curtains and watched a Harry Potter movie. That is a favourite thing to do in this house”.He said the family had been helped enormously by the many messages of support from neighbours, strangers who expressed solidarity, and politicians who expressed outrage.Mr Kenny added that he hoped the incident could be a defining moment.“Sometimes something big happens and it makes people think. It doesn’t have to be big but for some reason some things get to people and gives them pause for thought. If any good comes out of this disaster I hope people will sit up and realize we have to have compassion and be inclusive.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

Photograph: Sean Curtin.A material developed at University of Limerick “could help solve the global water crisis” by producing water from air, even in the most hostile of locations, researchers say.The crystalline material, known as ROS-037, has been developed after decades of research by Prof Michael Zaworotko, a Science Foundation Ireland research professor at UL’s Bernal Institute.Prof Zaworotko says the material is so efficient that it could extract water in the atmosphere over deserts and help grow crops in these environments.He said the material has such favourable properties for absorbing and releasing water that it “could revolutionise both dehumidification systems in buildings and availability of water in regions of drought”.It has been developed as a commercially viable “nanomaterial” – a crystal made up by tiny repeating units – by Molecule RND Ltd, an international research group and incubator fund that has relocated to UL to work with Prof Zaworotko’s team.In practice, the low energy desiccant, essentially a material that can capture water, could replace the silica traditionally used in dehumidification systems in buildings, Prof Zaworotko explained.“Silica has been used for a long time as a desiccant to pull water from the atmosphere, but it is not very efficient. If we replaced silica with this crystalline material, it would require substantially less energy to maintain air quality in buildings around the world,” he added.“Even in zones of very low humidity on Earth, even in deserts, there is still some water in the atmosphere. This material could be applied to capture the water from the air, meaning you could potentially grow crops there.”He added: “Without water, there is no life, no Plan B. About one third of the world’s population does not have access to pure water and this technology helps to solve that problem.”TrappedMolecule Ltd said the technology could “transform dehumidifiers into medical-grade water generators” that could solve the “global city heat island effect”, where vast amounts of heat are trapped in cities posing health and environmental risks –while enabling office buildings to produce their own water from air.The material operates exactly like inorganic desiccants used today, but regenerates at 49 degrees instead of 204 degrees, which drastically reduces the energy used by existing dehumidifier equipment.“We approached Mike to develop a material for us that could help solve the global water crisis,” said Molecule’s chief technology officer Kurt Francis. “Our teams meshed to bridge the gap between academic scientific research with real world product development, engineering and business development.”Dehumidifiers make up a huge global industry and are found wherever air management is needed, in everything from office buildings to pharmaceuticals to dairy production.“What’s been holding them back is they’re inefficient due to the heat required to dry out the water vapour during the regeneration cycle. This technology solves that problem. As a result, you can curb your emissions and energy costs immediately,” he noted.He said the new material “has the capacity to transform global power consumption and provide a new source of pure water, even in dry climates”.Bernal Institute director Prof Luuk van der Wielen said the “exciting, game-changing technology” addressed a number of grand challenges around the theme of water handling.Molecule has orders for the first available commercial units with a prototype water generator delivering water with low purity without any filtration."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4065124.1572289708!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"france worked with ireland germany and eu officials on new brexit extension","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier leaving the European Commission in Brussels for a meeting with EU27 ambassadors to discuss an extension to the Brexit deadline. Photograph: EPAStephanie LecocqFrance worked with Ireland, Germany and officials of the European Council over the weekend to frame the terms of another British Brexit extension to January 31st, which member state ambassadors agreed on Monday morning. Without the agreement the UK was due to leave the EU on Friday.The decision, reached ahead of key votes in the Commons on Monday afternoon, allows for the holding of a pre-Brexit election and made clear that the sole purpose of the extension is to allow for the ratification process to be completed in London and Brussels, and that the content of the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for further discussion.The declaration “firmly” excludes any reopening of talks in the future.Sources say that although the council had previously made a similar insistence, and then negotiated changes with Boris Johnson, the member states are determined to concentrate minds in the Commons on the strong likelihood that further extensions are extremely unlikely and that the current deal is as good as it will get.The UK was also told it must also fulfil its treaty obligation to nominate a commissioner to the new commission even if heshe may only serve for two months during the extension. Failure to do so would create legal problems for the formation of the new commission.The UK will be allowed to leave the EU on the first of any month until that date once the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified by the Commons. OppositionSources close to the Elysee confirmed over the weekend that France’s president Emmanuel Macron had accepted that the increased likelihood of an election in the UK had made his opposition to a three-month extension less tenable. They said French diplomats had taken the initiative in brokering firmer terms for the extension, and particularly the ruling out of renegotiation. Formally speaking, the ambassadors set in train the “written procedure” for approval of decisions by leaders in the absence of a full summit. That will happen after the UK signals its acceptance of the extension, likely to be through its ambassador to the EU, and is expected to be completed without difficulty within 24 hours.The UK had previously been granted an extension to Friday, and is required under the terms of its Benn Act to accept the EU’s offer of an extension to January 31st unless the Commons votes it down.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: EPA The UK is on course for a December general election after Jeremy Corbyn announced that Labour’s conditions to back the move had been met.Mr Corbyn told his shadow cabinet the party would launch the “most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen” now a no-deal Brexit was “off the table”.His announcement came after Boris Johnson formally accepted a Brexit extension, definitively breaking his “do or die” commitment to leave the EU by October 31st.The UK prime minister will on Tuesday attempt to convince MPs to back an early general election for the fourth time when he calls on MPs to vote for a December 12th poll.Mr Corbyn told his top team on Tuesday morning: “I have consistently said that we are ready for an election and our support is subject to a no-deal Brexit being off the table.“We have now heard from the EU that the extension of Article 50 to January 31st has been confirmed, so for the next three months, our condition of taking no-deal off the table has now been met.“We will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen.”The prime minister will attempt to convince the Commons to vote for a December 12th election using a short Bill which sets aside the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act (FTPA).Crucially, the success of this move requires the backing of only a simple majority of MPs rather than the two-thirds “super majority” which he failed three times to win under the FTPA.However, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP are reluctant to accept his date — fearing it allows time to bring the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to implement the UK prime minister’s new Brexit deal before MPs ahead of the start of the campaign.They have previously signalled support for a poll on December 9th, but could put forward a proposal for an election on December 11th — which the Government is likely to accept.The prime minister’s official spokesman said a December 9th vote would not be “logistically possible” but said other proposed compromise dates would be considered by the government.Mr Corbyn’s move does not mean a December election is certain, with Labour expected to support amendments to the Bill.An alteration to the polling date and other amendments reflecting their policy, such as votes for 16 and 17-year-olds, are being considered.Downing Street said votes for EU nationals could cause “administrative chaos” while allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to take part would be “administratively impossible” to deliver.“There are long-standing conventions that election laws should only be changed after appropriate consultation,” the prime minister’s spokesman said.“The Electoral Commission warns against changing electoral laws less than six months before an election.”Flanked by members of his shadow cabinet, an energised Mr Corbyn did not rule out backing any changes, telling reporters outside Labour’s London HQ: “There will be a parliamentary process this afternoon.”But he added: “We are going out there to fight an election campaign and I can’t wait to get out there on the streets.”However some of his MPs have ruled out backing a general election on Tuesday, including Anna Turley and Kevan Jones, while Barry Sheerman said it was “sheer madness” to hold a December poll.Earlier on Tuesday, Liberal Democrats MP Chuka Umunna said his party is against holding a general election on Mr Johnson’s preferred polling date of December 12th, telling BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It cannot be the 12th.”However, Mr Umunna signalled the Liberal Democrats could be flexible over their own preferred election date of December 9th.He said: “We will see what else they come forward with. We have got to break the gridlock.”The one-page Bill, titled the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019, sets the date of the proposed general election as December 12th.ReactionSenior Labour MPs have insisted they are relishing the prospect of a December general election, despite one of their colleagues describing the plan as “sheer madness”.Several members of Mr Corbyn’s top team also backed the party’s shift in stance.Shadow Employment Minister Laura Pidcock — one of the favourites to be next Labour leader — echoed others, simply posting: “Bring it on!”However, not all in the party were pleased. Huddersfield MP Barry Sheerman described the move to back an election “on Boris Johnson’s agenda” as “sheer madness”.“I hear Labour frontbenchers \u0026amp whips resigning over decision to vote for December election,” he claimed.Likewise, Green Party MP and former leader Caroline Lucas said the decision to back an election was “hugely disappointing”.“Why give Johnson exactly what he wants?” she asked.“Election — (especially) under First Past the Post — won’t resolve Brexit.“Many examples of majority Govt being returned on minority vote — real risk that the majority in favour of #PeoplesVote won’t have voices heard.”Although supporting his party’s decision, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan suggested a new referendum was still the most important next step in the Brexit process.“But if there is to be a general election first, then those whose future is most affected must be given a say — including 16 and 17-year-olds and EU citizens living in the UK,” he added.And former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron appeared to have his tongue firmly in his cheek when he responded to the development.“Hang on, I don’t think Corbyn has specified which Christmas...” he tweeted.Speaker of the HouseThe Speaker John Bercow is due to stand down on Thursday after more than 10 years of chairing proceedings.One of UK government’s last tasks would be to choose a new Speaker. An election to replace John Bercow is due to take place on November 4th . His last day as Speaker is Thursday, October 31st. Once parliament has been dissolved, the election campaign would be properly under way.

Video: ReutersA December general election now looks all but certain, after Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would be prepared to support Boris Johnson’s latest effort to trigger an early poll.What is the UK government proposing?The prime minister wants an election on Thursday December 12th, with a possible compromise date of December 11th. He originally proposed December 12th, which would have allowed a few more days for MPs to debate his withdrawal agreement bill, and tabled a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.That plan failed to win the backing of the required two-thirds of MPs in the House of Commons on Monday night, with Labour abstaining, but Mr Johnson immediately announced he would table a one-line bill, again calling for a December 12th election.This would require a simple majority to pass, and echoes a plan put forward by the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party at the weekend, though they preferred a December 9th date.What will Labour do?Corbyn’s party has agonised about whether to support a pre-Christmas poll. The Labour leader has been keen to hit the campaign trail, but some members of the shadow cabinet were very reluctant.Some had hoped a second referendum could have been secured first, while others would have liked to see Mr Johnson’s Brexit deal debated and agreed, to allow Labour to focus on domestic policies during a campaign.But Mr Corbyn eventually prevailed and Labour will now back a December election.Why the row about the date?Students may have broken up for university by December 12th and it could be harder to get this cohort to vote if they are travelling between two locations. Mr Corbyn brought this point up with Mr Johnson over the dispatch box on Monday night and was heckled by Conservative MPs.Daylight hours are reduced and in Scotland it is dark at 4pm, or earlier on some of the islands. Some MPs say they are reluctant to go out campaigning in the cold and dark.Why didn’t Mr Johnson press ahead with trying to get his Brexit bill passed?The Conservatives say they do not want MPs to try to amend it and risk the bill being stuck in endless parliamentary gridlock.Some of Mr Johnson’s advisers, particularly those who are veterans of the Vote Leave campaign, have been pressing for an early poll, hoping they can capitalise on the prime minister’s success in securing a deal with the EU and Labour’s discomfort about its Brexit stance.Why do some parties prefer a December 9th poll?The Liberal Democrats and the SNP proposed an election on Monday December 9th to ensure the government had no time to bring its Brexit deal back. They have also warned about the risk of students being disenfranchised.The Liberal Democrat MP Chuka Umunna said the party was not prepared to accept December 12th. “If you have the 12th, it presents an opportunity for the government to get their withdrawal agreement bill through. The reason the 9th is preferable is because it would stop them from bringing forward their withdrawal bill and completing its passage through the Commons,” he said.Why does the government object to December 9th?The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said the date was not realistic as 25 working days were needed between the dissolution of parliament and polling day. Parliament would have to be dissolved on Friday, while also securing royal assent for the election bill, and passing a Northern Irish budget bill, which could be very difficult to achieve.Which date will win out? Will there be a compromise?The SNP and Liberal Democrats were warmer on December 10th or 11th than December 12th. Labour has suggested it is likely to back efforts to amend the date, but the party is unlikely to withdraw support from the government’s election bill as a result.Labour sources said the party had made a decision in principle to support a December poll. –"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4065114.1572288331!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pete buttigieg young democratic candidate defying categorisation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana,  talks to supporters  in Rock Hill, South Carolina on Sunday.

He married his partner, Chasten, an elementary school teacher, last year.But, in addition to his liberal credentials, the young mayor has attributes that typically appeal to conservatives.After working for McKinsey, he joined the Navy Reserve. He later took a leave of absence as mayor of South Bend when he was deployed to Afghanistan. He is also a practicing Christian, and one of the few Democratic candidates to talk openly about their faith.Born and raised in Indiana, Mayor Pete – as he is colloquially known – is in tune with the American midwest. However, his homely, hometown instincts can sometimes mask a formidable intellect: he studied at Harvard before winning a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford, and is fluent in several languages.This idiosyncratic blend of midwestern liberalism has resonated since he announced his candidacy in January.Polls place him at the top of the so-called second-tier candidates in the crowded Democratic field, behind frontrunners Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, but ahead of party stalwarts like senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar.Polling extremely wellWorryingly for his rivals, he is polling extremely well in Iowa, the first state in the nation to select a Democratic candidate. A RealClearPolitics poll for Iowa puts him at 15.8 per cent, just behind Biden and Warren. He has opened more offices in Iowa than any other candidate.Mayor Pete’s steady rise has been bolstered by a formidable fundraising machine. He raised $24.8 million in the second quarter of this year, more than any of his rivals, and $19.1 million in the third quarter – an impressive fundraising haul for a candidate who has never held national or statewide office.Here at Rock Hill, supporters have been queuing for hours to hear from the Indiana mayor.26-year-old Charles Deloach was first in line, queuing for more than three hours. He is a true Buttigieg supporter.\u0026nbsp“I believe that this is the best person to lead the country in the direction it needs to go. His resume is impressive – Harvard, Oxford, all those languages – but he is also a good person who is honest and can speak to people who don’t necessarily agree with him.\u0026nbsp One of the biggest problems facing the country right now is the ision between people, so it’s important.”He references the fact that Buttigieg is one of the few Democrats to have agreed to an interview with Fox News – a decision that he believes shows his willingness to engage with all Americans.Others are waiting to learn more about a candidate who lacks the national profile of figures like Biden, Warren or Sanders. John and Russ have travelled from Greensboro, North Carolina. “I like what I’ve seen so far in the debates, particularly his views on healthcare,” says John. Russ also believes that he could be a good alternative to Joe Biden. “I have a lot of respect for Mr Biden,” he says, “but still . . .” he trails off.Political pragmatistAs he takes to the stage, Buttigieg instantly connects with the crowd. His message is subtle but well-crafted: that he is a political pragmatist who can connect with Americans of all persuasion. \u0026nbsp“The sun is going to come up over a country that is going to be even more ided, even more torn up over politics than we are right now,” he says of next year’s election. “Leadership is going to matter more than ever. I’m running to be the president that can pick up the pieces and bring this country back together,” he adds, to cheers.Throughout his 20-minute stump speech and question-and-answer session, Buttigieg brandishes his credentials as a political centrist, the culmination of an ideological journey that has seen him track closer to the centre in recent months.Neither Elizabeth Warren nor Joe Biden are mentioned, but he jabs at his main rivals nonetheless. On Medicare for All, Elizabeth Warren’s bold plan to abolish private health insurance, he says his policy is “medicare for all who want it”, vowing not to force any one to give up their health insurance.Similarly, he brushes off questions about his age, a veiled reference to 76-year-old Joe Biden, pointing to young leaders such as French president Emmanuel Macron and Jacinda Ardern, prime minister of New Zealand, and arguing that all successful Democratic presidential candidates in recent history were perceived as outside shots who ultimately won the White House.But while Buttigieg is a hero to the true believers gathered here in Rock Hill holding “Boot Edge Edge” and “South Carolina for Pete” signs, he is also facing formidable challenges.Clear problemButtigieg’s poor polling among African-Americans is a clear problem for his candidacy. Among the 1000 or so people who have gathered for his rally in Rock Hill, only a handful are African-Americans – in a state where the majority of Democratic voters are black.In the AME Zion church in downtown Rock Hill, a five-minute drive from his downtown rally, the atmosphere is very different as the congregation prepares for its Sunday service and annual conference. Buttigieg’s appearance at the church is one of several black outreach events on the mayor’s schedule during this three-day campaign trip to South Carolina as he tries to tap into the African-American vote.As the congregation prepares for their service, most of the worshippers say they have never heard of the young mayor. One person they have heard of, however, is Joe Biden. Flyers with “Joe 2020 – our best days still lie ahead” adorn a table in the church foyer. Biden has campaigned here several times, and the members of this church still remember him.“Pete who?” asks Margaret Holley, from nearby Fall Mill, as she gathers with choir members outside the church door. “Joe Biden’s my man,” she says, as she extols the virtues of a man who she says has done so much for senior Americans and people from her community.As Mayor Pete enters the church, bible in hand, he joins the procession entering the church. In his address to the congregation he sets out his experience as a mayor, and talks to some of the problems facing the black community – poor maternal health records, gun crime, addiction – eliciting applause. He also makes oblique reference to what may be a problem for his candidacy among some church-going African-American denominations: his sexuality. Focus group research commissioned by the Buttigieg campaign suggested that some black voters in South Carolina may be uncomfortable with a gay man as president.Deep faith“I know what it is to find acceptance where you least expect it,” he tells the congregation, as he highlights his own deep faith. “God has been good to me.”Biden’s outreach in states such as South Carolina may pay off down the line, if Buttigieg emerges successfully from the Iowa and New Hampshire caucuses. In the meantime his campaign is ensuring that he visits as many corners of America as possible. Buttigieg even has a word for Irish-American voters, taking some time to speak to The  during his weekend whistle-stop tour through South Carolina. As the mayor of South Bend, where the historically Irish-American University of Notre Dame is located, he is well aware of the power of Irish-America.“I’ve a soft spot for Ireland and obviously the whole city of South Bend, the University of Notre Dame does too,” he says with a smile. “We’ve been honoured in the past to host the Taoiseach in South Bend on the campus and it’s a really important and fruitful relationship,” he adds, noting that, with Brexit, it is “all the more important for us to make sure that our relationship with Ireland is strong”With that he is off to his next campaign stop – a three-day bus tour across northern Iowa next week – as Mayor Pete pledges to convince Democratic voters that he can become the man to lead America."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit latest news: December election on knife edge as No 10 threatens to pull plan over votes for 16 year oldsRembrandt masterpieces will stay inside Getty Center as California wildfire approachesStudent found dead after going on extreme diet to lose weight for upcoming holiday, inquest hears Women in their 40s earning more than those in their 30s for the first time, government data revealsHalloween 2019: How Celtic trick-or-treating and Gaelic turnip-carving led to the American celebrationSoldier \u0026#39raped woman following BBQ at army barracks after telling her the way she was dressed was inviting attention\u0026#39 Which party benefits from a December election?Britain set for first non-Thursday election since 1931, which could be good news for the ToriesLawyer who claimed £60k in disability benefits caught out after celebrating court victory, judges hearLebanon Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigns saying he has \u0026#39reached a dead end\u0026#39Essex lorry deaths: Two Northern Irish brothers wanted on suspicion of manslaughterUS helicopter raid reported in Syria after trove of Baghdadi intelligence takenSix Syrian soldiers killed as regime army and Turkish military clash for first time since offensiveComment: Boris Johnson will seize his chance to secure a Parliament ready to get Brexit doneDuke of Sussex meets Team UK competitors for Invictus GamesPolice officer run down by car in TottenhamIrish priests call for celibacy rules to be relaxed and women to be ordained amid clergymen shortageBeavers could be reintroduced into the wild by government for first time in 500 years, environment minister Zac Goldsmith suggestsGrenfell Tower report: Fire union chief hits back at \u0026#39back-to-front\u0026#39 criticism saying ministers are \u0026#39evading scrutiny\u0026#39 Ruth Davidson abandons plan to take second job with lobbying firmWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 29 october 2019","story":"Deer stags rutting in a frost and mist covered landscape on a bright winter morning in Richmond Park, London.

And it smells pretty bad. An 18 per cent fall in pre-tax profits and a 3 per cent fall in revenues. Asia did OK (earnings were up by 4 per cent) and it might have been better still without the turmoil in Hong Kong and the US-China trade war. \u0026nbspThere’s obviously Brexit, which won’t have helped the bank’s commercial and City businesses in the UK. But it would probably still have looked a bit rubbish even without that, as did the\u0026nbspEuropean and US businesses. Given its franchise, HSBC should be doing better all-round.\u0026nbspQuinn says he wants to “re-model the bank”.\u0026nbspThat’s his pitch. His big idea.

So has Ewen Stevenson. He’s the bank’s current finance director, but has only been with it since January having been hired from RBS. So he’d be a compromise, a sort of internalexternal hire. Coming from RBS, he’d know a thing or two about turbulence and restructuring.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspInevitably, people have been looking at JP Morgan, a bank that turns everyone connected with HSBC green with envy given how it has\u0026nbspzoomed past\u0026nbspand now seems to be on a completely different (and much faster) road.

But it has prompted intense anger from actors and directors, who argue that the change could ruin the watching experience.Actor Aaron Paul suggested the feature would mean Netflix completely taking control of everyone else’s art and destroying it. Judd Apatow said that he would call every director and show creator on Earth to fight you on this and that the company should leave things as they were intended to be seen.The outcry led Netflix to publish a blog post in which it defended the update and made clear that there was no plan to roll out the feature in the short term.This last test has generated a fair amount of feedback –\u0026nbspboth for and against, wrote Keela Robison, vice president for product at Netflix.

New York native Iliza Shlesinger brings a fresh take on topics from modern dating to wedding planning headaches. Her show is a delightful mix of reality checks and insightful takes.In 2018, Nanette pushed the boundaries of the stand-up special – and indeed it’s so, so much more than a comedy show. In a little more than an hour, Hannah Gadsby deconstructs the makings of a good joke, explains why she’s done with self-deprecation, and delivers an unforgettable, incredibly powerful take on the trauma she’s experienced as a lesbian in Tasmania.Standout line: “I have built a career out of self-deprecating humour and I don’t want to do that anymore. Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It’s not humility, it\u0027s humiliation. I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak, and I simply will not do that anymore. Not to myself or anybody who identifies with me.”If you liked Ali Wong in Always Be My Maybe (which she co-wrote!), then you’re going to love her in Hard Knock Wife (her second Netflix special and a follow-up on her 2016 debut Baby Cobra). Her unapologetic takes on motherhood and marriage (did you know she makes a lot more money than her husband and she’s not sorry?) are gold.Standout line: “Now, I make a lot more money than my husband by, like, a long shot. My mom is very concerned that he’s going to leave me out of intimidation. I had to explain to her that the only kind of man who would leave a woman who makes more money… is the kind of man that doesn’t like free money.”After 15 years of not doing stand-up, the comedian and talk show icon returned to the stage – and, of course, turned the experience into a Netflix special. Under the pretence of pondering whether she’s still relatable, Ellen DeGeneres basks in the (well-earned) glory her accomplishments, reflects on her personal experiences – including her 1997 coming-out and how it was received in Hollywood – and riffs on the absurdities of daily life. What a treat.510 Son of Patricia, Trevor NoahTrevor Noah has been starring in comedy specials for a decade, so it’s no surprise that he can take just about any topic (tourism in Bali, trap music, a conversation with President Barack Obama) and turn it into incisive jokes.Katherine Ryan’s second Netflix special (the follow-up to In Trouble, which came out in 2017) tackles some of her trademark topics, from dating to co-parenting, in a lighthearted, self-affirming way. A delight through and through.Back in 2012, Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, was appearing as the unforgettable Troy Barnes in Community – and spared a little time to record a Netflix special, which remains available to this day. Throughout this one-hour show, he shows off his range, reflecting on his music career, reaching his late twenties, and that brief time when the internet really wanted him to play Spider-Man.Standout line: “I lived in Downtown LA, and Downtown LA is kind of like the Eighties decided to stay there. They’re like, ‘Oh, OK, you guys go ahead and be the Nineties. Go enjoy Ace of Base – we’ll be here practicing the Moonwalk and selling crack.’”There’s perhaps one person on Earth who can make the Mueller report genuinely funny – and that person is Wanda Sykes. The comedian might be best known for her roles on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Black-ish, but her stand-up is well worth a watch. She has impeccable timing, sharp writing, and an apparently effortless ability to connect with her crowd.Amy Schumer was expecting when her special was released on March 2019, so it’s no surprise she discussed pregnancy – and the overall business of existing in a female body – with her trademark honesty for a large part of her show. This special is actually made up of two shows, Dark and Jigsaw. The Scottish comedian refreshes the “fish out of water” archetype by delivering his take on the US – and that time he told a joke about being an atheist in Indiana. His smart writing enables him to tackle topics, such as disability and – yes – paedophilia, in a way few comics could pull off.Standout line: “As a parent – no, I’m not a parent, but I like speaking for other people, because I’m white, middle-class and male, and that’s what my people do.”If you didn’t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again.

We’ve been sensitive to creator concerns and haven’t included bigger screens, in particular TVs, in this test, she wrote in the blog post.Every film and TV show coming to Netflix in NovemberShe also mentioned that the feature has long been available on\u0026nbspDVD\u0026nbspplayers - and has been frequently requested by our members. She pointed to examples such as people looking to watch a scene again, or go slower because they are watching in a foreign language.As well as those changes, Netflix stressed that the feature corrects the pitch in the audio. And users must select the different speed each time they watch, rather than being able to change the speed across all of their content.The feature will not roll out in the short term, Ms Robison wrote. And whether we introduce these features for everyone at some point will depend on the feedback we receive.While few TV and film streaming services offer the ability to speed up or slow down – though YouTube has long had the option – a number of other apps do include the feature. Podcast players in particular usually give users the ability to change the playback speed, a decision that occasionally prompts criticism from producers.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

stay put policy, it says this meant dozens of people stayed inside the building rather than evacuating.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe report describes the\u0026nbspmeasure as an “article of faith” within the LFB, “so powerful that to depart from it was to all intents and purposes unthinkable”.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This was “remarkably insensitive”, it says.\u0026nbspThe LFB has\u0026nbspbeen defended by campaigners who argue that it is unfair to pin the blame on the fire service.\u0026nbspOne unnamed source told\u0026nbspThe Independent: “While I welcome the fact that blame has been apportioned to so many different entities, it strikes me as odd that firefighters are named when the companies that produced the materials that led to the fire – such as\u0026nbspArconic,\u0026nbspCellotex,\u0026nbspRydon,\u0026nbspRBKC\u0026nbspand its so-called arms-length management organisation the\u0026nbspTMO\u0026nbsp– are not.Grenfell report must criticise authorities, say survivors and bereaved“The report says a lot but I think it says too much about those who shouldn’t be blamed and too little about those who should be.”Emma Dent\u0026nbspCoad, Labour MP for Kensington, who\u0026nbspsaid the report was blaming those “sent to the scene of a crime, when the crime has already been committed”.She added: “Five years of bad decisions, dodgy dealings, possible fraud potentially, all kinds of hideous decisions going on elsewhere – that built the bonfire around Grenfell.\u0026nbspThat building had total integrity for 40 years. It had functioned as it was built, and the stay put policy was 100 per cent accurate.\u0026nbspThe firefighters when they arrived had no idea what has happened, they hadn’t been told, that information wasn’t available. It’s completely obscene.”Sir Martin also highlights a “worrying failure of communication” between the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) and the\u0026nbspLFB, which\u0026nbspmeant there was an “unacceptable delay” between the first request for a dangerous structures engineer on the scene.The report also flags up the fact that the RBKC tenant management organisation\u0026nbspemergency plan was “15\u0026nbspyears out of date” and that RBKC’s response to the fire was consequently\u0026nbsp“ineffective”.The “principle reason” the fire spread across the 24-storey block so quickly was the aluminium composite material (ACM) rainscreen panels with a flammable polyethylene core, which “acted as a source of fuel”, Sir Martin says.\u0026nbspThis was further accelerated by the insulation boards behind the cladding panels and the window surrounds, both of which had combustible materials, which has also been added during a refurbishment of the building several months before the fire.In an analysis of how the blaze started, the inquiry states\u0026nbspthat it was an “electrical fault in a large fridge-freezer” in Flat 16, and ascertains that Behailu Kebede, the occupant of the flat, will be absolved of any blame for the inferno.\u0026nbspThe report notes that the fire was “relatively minor” and typical of a common kitchen pan fire, stating that a blaze of this size was perfectly foreseeable”.While some affected by the tragedy will welcome the findings of the report, others have described them as “rather hit and miss”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But Johnson admitted the EU was inclined to offer an extension to the end of January and that Emmanuel Macron was fighting a lonely battle against it.Earlier in the day, the Elysée told No the French President was too isolated on the issue to veto a longer extension.In a sign of how much he is relying on Macron, Johnson then pleadingly recited the opening line of the carol “Oh come, oh come Emmanuel” to ministers.One of No’s hopes is that EU leaders will see the Opposition refusing both a general election and to pass the withdrawal agreement as is and come round to Macron’s way of thinking: That there is little point in offering this country a three-month extension as ­Parliament will just waste the time.One No source predicts that the sight of the opposition blocking an election will “push the EU towards either the Macron position or a very long extension”.In a sign that Johnson’s gambit is having some success, the EU is waiting until Parliament has voted on an election before deciding whatof extension to offer.If this doesn’t work, the Government hopes it can shame Labour into having an election.The Chief Whip told those present that they would “make Labour look like right d***s”they didn’t vote for an election.But not everyone is convinced this will work.One of those present tells me thatthey were a Labour MP, they would “rather look like a d*** than lose their seat”.I understand, though, No intends to bring multiple votes to try to force an election. One Cabinet minister who has discussed this strategy with Johnson tells me: “Every time , it advertises that they are not prepared to support Brexit or have an election.“It reinforces the sense that he is the only person trying to get things done.”Johnson himself has told allies thatLabour rejects his offer to pass the withdrawal agreement and have an election, then it will be an “effective demonstration” that this Parliament won’t — and can’t — break the current deadlock.Proving this Parliament can’t break the deadlock is one thing. Actually breaking it is quite another.One of those present on Thursday tells me Johnson seemed genuinely angry at Labour’s refusal to give him an election and “betrayed a sense he’s cornered”.Something must happen before January , though.If it doesn’t, the threat of No Deal will be back on the table.Andthe UK has wasted this extension, European patience may snap and they might not offer another one.One senior Cabinet minister tells me “there will be an attempt to use an SOto put the Withdrawal Agreement Bill before the House”. This would involve the rebel group around Oliver Letwin trying to bring the deal back to Parliament so that the Commons could vote on it. But it is far from clear whether this approach could work.Another possibility is the Opposition bringing down the Government. If they did this, they would have to agree on an alternative prime minister or end up in a general election.British politics looks more deadlocked than ever today. Johnson’s hope is that pressure from voters will eventually break this deadlock and sweep away the obstacles to him passing his Brexit deal.But he will almost certainly have to put up with a delay both to Brexit and the election before he can get his way.NO one at political Cabinet spoke against the idea of a December election. But privately, several ministers have grave doubts about the wisdom of this strategy.One frets: “Who jumps out of bed on a cold December morning to vote for the Government ”There is a view that the Government could have used getting the Commons to approve its deal in broad terms as a spur for pressing on with the ­legislation, bringing a new timetable to the Commons after MPs rejected its initial offer of three days’ debate. One complains that the election idea is “a massive distraction”.“Why aren’t we using the momentum of getting a second reading ” they ask.On the backbenches there are also concerns. One senior backbencher tells me: “We’ll vote for an election with great reluctance.”He worries that “being seen to try not very hard to get the bill through” undercuts the new Tory message that they are the deal party.The other great worry is that while the public mood is with Boris Johnson now, that could change. One minister warns it is a huge risk to have a “winter election at a very febrile time”, adding: “We’ve no idea what public opinion will be on polling day.”IF Boris Johnson gets his way and there’s a general election this year, what happens to those Tories who lost the whip for voting for the Benn Act At Thursday’s gathering, Nicky Morgan argued that the party needed “clarity” on what would happen to those who had lost the whip but had voted with the Government against the Letwin amendment and for the Brexit deal and the accelerated timetable for passing it.Boris Johnson has previously been adamant that he would not allow any of the  to stand as Tory candidates at the next election. But I am told he made sympathetic noises in response to Morgan’s point.Inside Boris Johnson’s circle, there’s the beginnings of a sht in attitude. There is a feeling that those who have consistently voted with the Government in recent weeks are worth bringing back in.With a deal secured, the issue that led to their rebellion has been addressed.At the same time, several of these MPs would be better placed to hold their seat for the Tories than any other candidate.AT political Cabinet on Thursday, Boris Johnson pointed at the Northern Powerhouse Minister Jake Berry and said “Kwasi”, a reference to Kwasi Kwarteng the Energy Minister.Cabinet ministers were baffled at how the PM confused the two.They don’t look at all alike.After Berry deadpanned, “An easy mistake to make”, the room fell about laughing.A Budget would offer the Tories a chance to outline some of their more popular economic policies and highlight plans to boost infrastructure.If the Opposition voted it down, it would make the case for the election Boris Johnson so desperately wants.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When the nation voted on whether or not to leave the EU, it was boiled down to the simplest possible question and answer: Yes or No.So the die was cast and we voted to split with the EU. But that’s the thing about orce.Between the time you say you want one, and the time you actually get your decree nisi there is a whole lot of pain as the time is filled with blame, retribution and name-calling.Because of the lack of clarity from the vote on what it meant to leave, no one thought about the most important aspects, the red lines, of how Britain should leave the EU.It didn’t need a clairvoyant to predict that lots of those dferent Brexit visions would be fundamentally incompatible.We can’t stay in the customs union and have complete control of immigration.We can’t have no hard border on the island of Ireland the Good Friday Agreement and also leave the single market. I could go on.The point is that the nation answered Yes or No to something that — it turns out — our politicians have decided to interpret in multiple ways.And that has been the fundamental problem.Because MPs have been unable to compromise in order to find a deal that pleases them enough for it to be passed. And the public despair.Politics only s effectively when a party has a clear majority to get their legislation through government. And this one doesn’t.It’s no surprise that neither party has a clear majority while they are being led by the more extreme and dogmatic elements.I was in the House of Lords and the House of Commons on Wednesday and the contrast in atmosphere between the two is stark.Politicians in the Commons don’t listen or pay each other any respect.And the amount of average front bench MPs on both sides is shameful. No wonder we have stalemate.There is an unbridgeable gulf between Leavers and Remainers, and an inability among politicians to compromise.We’ve either got to leave with No Deal or we have to revoke Article  altogether.There is nothing in between, no room for compromise or pragmatism. As a result, we are paralysed. So the answer has to be to have a general election.Usually it’s politicians who tell us what to do for the good of the country, but now we need to tell the politicians what to do.Because only with a majority government can we put an end to the Brexit misery.Although who relishes the prospect of voting on a dark December night  Least of all Jeremy Corbyn, the only Opposition leader in history who has refused the offer of an election more than once.It’s no wonder when you look at the polls. He’s unelectable, but still using his position to block Brexit and stop us from getting on with it.Until there is an election we remain in this terrible limbo. I voted Remain but, like most people, now I just want it over with.Politicians must stop using Brexit for their own political aims.If they don’t soon come up with a solution, the risk is that people are increasingly likely to vote for extreme options in a bid to make it stop.And that is a scary prospect.WHEN it comes to le choices I am a big believer in the live and let live school of thought.Andpeople choose to have cosmetic surgery because it makes them feel better, that’s their choice.But in the latest photos of Lauren Goodger her flawless complexion and insanely pillowy pout are so extreme I didn’t realise it was her.Which, to me, raises the question of why anyone would want to render themselves completely unrecogniseable IT is ironic that one of the most important causes of our time – climate change – is being eclipsed by the behaviour of the very people professing to be addressing the issue.Following last week’s debacle with the protestor on the Tube at Canning Town, this week a jobless Extinction Rebellion protester who spray-painted a war memorial has been ordered by a judge to pay £ as punishment for “senseless vandalism”.The volunteer tree-planter, Joseph O’Malley, wrote the word “mother” on the ft tall bronze sculpture in Whitehall last November, Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard.And protestors who act like this wonder why we have no sympathy for them.Meanwhile, this year’s ongoing Extinction Rebellion protests have so far cost the taxpayer £million, it emerged this week.Sure, their argument would be that the cost to the taxpayer will ultimately be a lot more than thatwe do nothing about climate change.But these tactics and statistics make me seethe with anger.I, like most of us, have to go to work so people like O’Malley can choose instead to spend their time damaging a memorial dedicated to heroes who sacriced their lives so that, ironically, yobs like him can enjoy freedom.In my view a fine is not enough. His benefits should be stopped and he should be jailed for such a disgraceful and disrespectful act.Make no mistake, stopping climate change is essential for all of our futures.But these tactics are not only distracting and damaging to that cause they are actively counter productive.But put together with another story this week showing that the number of children aged between eight and  with anorexia has doubled , it is a good reminder that we should all keep an eye on our children’s phone use.ANYONE  catch Nigella Lawson’s ultimately down to earth confession that she followed up an evening of fine dining at Noble Rot, a snazzy award-winning restaurant in London, by eating a bag of pickled onion Monster Munch in bed.You’ve got to love the fact that after eating oysters, black pudding and venison Nigella has a Monster Munch nightcap.I am fully supportive. It’s just that, well, in bed  I can think only of the crumbs.SO sorry to hear about Amanda Holden’s bad luck breaking her leg on holiday at half-term.Buther cloud has a silver lining it is surely the fact that there are not that many people who could manage to look quite so glamorous with a leg that’s broken in two places.THIS week it was announced that jail sentences for terrorists will be increased.The Sentencing Council will propose changes to its guidelines after Parliament passed a new anti-terror law earlier this year which allowed for longer terms of imprisonment.Under the moves, the “starting point” for judges when jailing someone for “encouragement of terrorism” will double to ten years in the worst cases.But isn’t there something wrong with the fact that laws to delay Brexit get passed in hours, yet laws like this take months GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

By denying us a vote on his deal HE is now the one blocking Brexit.The  Labour manesto on which I was re-elected was clear: “Labour accepts the referendum result”.It promised we would “seek to unite the country around a Brexit deal that works for every community in Britain”.I repeated these words countless times in my constituency, a former mining area of Nottinghamshire that suffered under Conservative governments.I told them Labour would respect the  per cent of them who voted to leave, but that we would never stop fighting for a Brexit that brought them closer to prosperity not further away from it.This could be our last chance to keep that promise. That is why I voted with the Government on Tuesday.I did so not because I like Boris Johnson’s deal, but because I don’t like it and I want the chance to change it.This version of Brexit is flawed. It weakens workplace rights, consumer rights and environmental protections.It doesn’t include a customs union, which would be good for workers and businesses.This is not about supporting the Tories and their miserable agenda. It is about my role as an MP in opposition.I agree with John McDonnell, who said earlier this week: “By amending the Withdrawal Agreement Bill . . . MPs have an opportunity to reject the  choice between Boris Johnson’s bad deal and No Deal, and instead support an agreement that works for everyone.”I have signed Tory MP Ken Clarke’s amendment to stay in the customs union, safeguarding our economy and the many businesses that would sufferwe leave it. I want to make sure that working people are protected.I want to ensure that Brexit doesn’t give the Tories a chance to attack workers’ rights, as they have been doing for a decade.If we can’t get those changes, I won’t vote for the Bill at the final stage. In , I launched Labour’s Remain campaign alongside Jeremy Corbyn.I travelled the country making the case for the EU as the best way to guarantee workers rights, economic stability and environmental protections, among other things.But we lost that campaign. AndI stand for anything, I stand for respecting the voices and interests of working class people, who overwhelmingly voted to leave the EU.Some  per cent of those who voted to leave say that politicians don’t listen to people like them. It is these people I came into politics to give a voice to.I can’t ignore them on the major issue of our time. I know Labour colleagues who voted against the Government this week are also deeply committed to those voters.These decisions are not easy for any of us. There is an appetite for compromise in the country which is not reflected in Parliament.Earlier this year, I invited both passionate Leavers and Remainers in my constituency to meet. The debate was lively, but there was none of the shouting and jeering we see in Parliament.The majority of Remainers said they were willing to respect the result and Leavers still wanted to leave — but with a deal, not without one.If voters can compromise, why can’t politicians  I didn’t come into Parliament to protest, but to deal with the world as it is, and make it a bit better.However I can, I want to tell my constituents that I did everything I could to get the Brexit nearly  per cent of them voted for, while protecting jobs and rights in the process.Shortly after the referendum I was at a bus stop in my constituency. I was chatting to a woman and the conversation turned to Brexit. Having voting to leave the EU, she asked: “Do you think it will actually happen ”I didn’t hesitate to say, “Of course! We are a democracy and that’s how people voted.” I never thought that three-and-a-half years later we would still be arguing.If Boris Johnson really wants to deliver Brexit he has to do the one thing he’s so far failed to do — and that’s compromise. This General Election will be about so much more than Brexit.It is a chance for us to create a country where power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many and not the privileged few and I will be giving my all to bring that about.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has already put himself out for hire for £, in recent days.Bercow whines he is “entitled to make a living”, and after ten shouty years on the globally screened Parliament Channel he has achieved lucrative star status.As cartoon TV hero Homer Simpson has proved, audiences love grotesques.Once free from high office, Bercow can quickly fill his boots with fees worth tens of thousands a time.But could there be another motive for his decision to go now rather than after he has completely screwed Brexit Had he stayed on, it seems he risked being “tried” on incendiary allegations of bullying and bringing Parliament into disrepute — an offence which might have cost him an automatic peerage and a seat in the House of Lords.Once out, he is “beyond the jurisdiction of Parliament”.Bercow has been haunted for years by allegations of volcanic temper tantrums and humiliation of staff, including some of the Commons’ most senior officials. He denies all the claims.Official probes have been shamelessly stymied by Labour because of Bercow’s “Bollocks to Brexit” stance.Labour grandee Dame Margaret Beckett blurted out her party’s motives, insisting Bercow must stay because Brexit “trumps bad behaviour”.The hypocrisy stinks. Labour claims to be the workers’ party. Here it is standing up for the bosses’ class.Parliament has also been criticised for failing victims of bullying. But kicking these charges into touch seems to have worked.Bercow’s decision to go now has persuaded former Black Rod David Leakey and the Speaker’s ex-Private Secretary, Angus Sinclair, to abandon claims of humiliation and abuse.In  Mr Sinclair, hardened by  years before the mast, told BBC Newsnight that Bercow mimicked him and was “prone to over-the-top anger”.Mr Leakey, an ex-Army Lieutenant-General, spoke of “the red mist descending” as Bercow “banged the table, yelled and was highly insulting to me personally”.He warns the Sundaythat a Bercow peerage would bring the House of Lords into disrepute at a time when politicians’ reputations are already at an all-time low.“Whatever Bercow’s merits as Speaker, I believe he should be treated in the same way as any other successful but disreputable citizen of the country,” says Leakey.“He is disreputable because, as a high-profile public figure, he has set an appalling example to the country, not least in publicly demeaning MPs in the chamber and on television.“As a senior figure in any other organisation, his behaviour would likely have resulted in investigation, censure or even dismissal.“He should not be rewarded with ‘baubles’ or a peerage.”Having watched this snarling, purple-faced Mr Punch discredit the constitution, stain the reputation of Parliament and demean the most distinguished post in British politics, it is impossible to disagree.There is now a chance for MPs to clean out this soiled stable and restore Parliament’s reputation.Decent Labour MP and popular Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle is front-runner for the job. But none of the candidates could be worse, even preachy Labour veteran Harriet Harman.To quote the former Black Rod, it should not be rewarded by any party with an unelected place on the overstuffed red benches of the House of Lords.BREXIT-cancelling Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson thinks we are all stupid.Her plot with the SNP to stage a snap election on Monday, December , has flashing red lights all over it.It would be a vehicle for oddball amendments including votes at  – just the impressionable age when fantasy politics appeals most.She pretends she is trying to stop Boris “crashing out” with No Deal.Yet Boris wants a deal. He has a deal.It’s Jo Swinson, her SNP cronies and the Labour Party who want to scupper that deal. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And soon, his poisonous ideology may be stamped out for good.IN a simpering interview yesterday, Justin Welby made a dig at Boris Johnson for “pouring petrol” on the isions of our country.Not for the first time, the interfering Archbishop has got it all wrong.It is not the Prime Minister who has torn Britain apart, but a small group of Remainers refusing to honour that vital principle underpinning democracy: losers’ consent.It was them and their MPs who instigated all this and who now — via their deranged campaign for a “people’s vote” — are blocking all progress on the Prime Minister’s pragmatic and sensible deal.The Remoaner Archbishop is part of the problem.Time he stopped meddling in politics and got back to his dwindling flock.IT is appalling that John Bercow — who steps down later this week — has been allowed to get away without being investigated over grave allegations of bullying.There is a new rule allowing investigations into grievance claims by ex staff, but oh so conveniently, it comes too late for the current Speaker.Shocking though it should be, this establishment stitch up is no surprise.Labour MPs happily propped up weaselling Bercow when he was inventing precedents willy-nilly to aid their Remoaner cause.ButMPs think that voters haven’t noticed what’s been going on, they’re living in cloud cuckoo land.An election is round the corner, and our useless MPs are in for a rude awakening.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Harry and Meghan went to Africa, with ITV, and made that trip all about their own anxieties and issues as well, without being half as engaging or sympathetic as Scarlett Moffatt.If anything, I think The British Tribe Next Door will also live longer in my memory than the royal version, not least because C seems to have got more than it bargained for with the Himba, who clearly aren’t big on marital fidelity.Some of the men are already looking to pick off Scarlett from the back of the Moffatt herd and episode one ended with this tantalising offer, from one of the women to her mum.“Betty, let us swap husbands tonight.” .So my interest in this show is now over.DAVID ATTENBOROUGH’S Seven Worlds, One Planet lived up to the usual visually stunning expectations for nearly an hour on Sunday night on BBC.A couple of cute baby animals won their struggle for le, two gender-fluid gastropods had it off at the bottom of the Antarctic Ocean and a bull elephant seal on South Georgia discovered: “cm of blubber is protection against the cold, but not from a four-ton opponent” – a bit like Tess Holliday did when Piers Morgan went for her on Twitter.The environmental message was also conveyed, in no uncertain terms, as the seas warmed, glaciers melted and an albatross chick almost got blown to buggery.Then,  minutes into the show, we were suddenly back on South Georgia, with Rolf the seasick cameraman, who was in front of the lens this time and so overcome by the fate of the penguins, and the future of the planet, he began sobbing like Rylan Clark-Neal just after Nicole Scherzinger had put him through to live shows.All the most pointless, virtue-signalling extinction rebels in the country were probably joining in with this gesture as well, even though it’s a moot point as to how close we are exactly to environmental Armageddon.What you can say with a little more certainty, though, is that the moment it starts trying to turn a David Attenborough documentary into an X Factor sob story it’s probably the beginning of the end for the BBC.THE Last Leg, Adam Hills: “Out of ­interest, what would we all dothis ­fabulous industry we’re in fell through for us and we had to go and find a job ”Have you ever considered comedy X Factor: Celebrity, Jenny Ryan: “It’s time for me to share what I’ve got with the world.”Jonathan Ross: “He’s the host of the very funny Mash Report. He’s a fabulous stand-up, Nish Kumar.”And X Factor: Celebrity, Simon Cowell to No Love Lost: “For all the doubters who thought this was going to be a car crash, you’ve proved a point.”It’s a car crash.Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “The term Martians refers to the supposed inhabitants of which planet ”Lucie: “Pass.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What Champion­ship team was originally called The Wednesday Football Club ”Orchid: “Tottenham Spurs.”Ben Shephard: “Which th Century military conflict is also known as The Great War ”Ben Shephard: “In a classic novel by Johanna Spyri, what is the name of the orphan sent to live with her grandfather in the Swiss Alps ”Steph: “Anne Frank.”CHANNEL  disclaimer of the week: “Be prepared right from the very start for graphic scenes of consensual bondage, sadomasochism, dominant and submissive sexual activity, dangerous procedures which only trained professionals should try, nudity and offensive language, all of which are likely to disturb some viewers.”And what an episode of Toot The Tiny Tugboat that was.SATURDAY’S first live episode of X Factor: Celebrity was an assault on two of your senses.The show now looks like it’s set in the display ring of a Herefordshire livestock market, but sounds more like the local abattoir during “Sunday roast” rush hour.Seriously, you dub Jenny Ryan or Ricki Lake singing Stevie Nicks’ Landslide, over a Peta video, the whole country would turn vegan by Monday morning.The miracle of the night, though, was BBC Religion Editor Martin Bashir, who was comfortably worse than both those two and sang like he’d been grabbed nuts-first backstage by Vinnie Jones, yet still got saved by Cowell and Nicole Scherzinger ahead of an understandably inconsolable Olivia Olson.The explanation, I think, lies in the fact Martin brings the precious gt of comedy to X Factor: Celebrity, hopping and skipping across the stage, in his Harold Lloyd get-up, to an old Bert Kaempfert classic.It presented a critical problem, though, for the clearly smitten Cowell, who’d been on the verge of saying the wrong thing all night, but provided the perfect assist on this occasion.“If you recognise that song . . .”Then seriously well done and Danke Schoen, Martin.TV GOLD: Will Sharpe’s scene-stealing performance as Rodney the rent boy in BBC’s engrossing drama Giri Haji.The albatross chick hauling itself back on to a nest and a penguin seal stand-off, from BBC’s Seven Worlds, One Planet.

Since production on the coins was paused a few days ago, the Treasury has refused to say how many were produced or what the minting cost. Officials claimed that data was commercially confidential - despite having boasted themselves that three million would be produced by exit day.

But as Mr Corbyn prepared for the fight of his political le, other MPs were deciding where andthey will stand in the election. If tonightaposs vote passes Parliament could be dissolved within days and Britain will be preparing for the first December election since . Boris Johnsonaposs bill would trigger a general election on December  - but MPs may yet try to wrestle control of the date. Crucially Labour have not yet explicitly confirmed that they will back the Bill, there are still wranglings over the date and Mr Corbyn faces an angry Labour revolt. But even without Labour support, the Bill was already expected to pass due to some agreement between the Tories, Lib Dems and SNP. If it is backed by Labouraposs leader, it will be almost impossible for the Bill to fail eventhere is a huge Labour rebellion. The first vote is due at pm, and a final vote is due at pm. Dozens of Labour MPs could rebelthey are whipped to back an election. Some  voted directly against holding a general election last night. And a string of prominent Tories were also furious at Boris Johnsonaposs decision to push ahead with an election instead of trying to pass his Brexit deal in Parliament.Heidi Allen, who was elected in  as a Conservative MP before leading the ill-fated Change UK and defecting to the Liberal Democrats, has confirmed she will not stand again .

Mum-of-one Victoria Parker had been on a coupleaposs getaway to Greece last month with her partner Paul Dempsey, , when they were escorted off their British Airways flight. BA claim that staff believed the couple were under the influence of alcohol following complaints from other passengers about their behaviour and turfed them off. The -year-old hairdresser admits she was aposa bit squfyapos and was told she wouldnapost be served any more alcohol after a aposcouple of glasses of wine and an ouzoapos before getting on the plane but denied being disruptive.    However after complaining about their treatment, the couple were sent two voucher codes each worth £ for their troubles as an aposapologyapos. Yet still furious over forking out £ for a new flight and hotel, Victoria continued her complaint and demanded a further explanation of what had gone on. To the coupleaposs horror, BA investigated the issue and realised that the £ vouchers and apology had been sent aposin errorapos - so the airline withdrew the lot. Instead, BA have backed their staff for booting off the couple and said it was the aposappropriate actionapos as aposdisruptive behaviour will not be toleratedapos. Yet Victoria has still refused to accept BAaposs verdict and in her search for an explanation even speculates that they might have been targeted because the flight was aposoversoldapos - while there is no evidence of this. Victoria, from Peterborough, Cambs, said: I donapost believe what they are saying, it is totally outrageous and none of it makes sense.

Shouldnapost it be the captainaposs decision  I accept I was a bit squfy after three drinks sat in the sun, but I was not in anyway disruptive. And why would they apologise and offer vouchers in the first placewe were those things  Victoria and Paul had been sat on the plane on the runway for  minutes before a member of staff approached and asked them to follow him. She claims it aposall happened so quicklyapos and before they knew it, they were being handed their luggage and told they would have to aposget a flight tomorrowapos. Victoria claims she was told the reason she had being taken off the plane was because she apostouched a manaposs armapos - which she claims was aposcompletely fabricatedapos.

The -year-old from Chelmsford in Essex juggles three part-time cleaning jobs to make ends meet – but dreams of retraining as a classroom assistant. Sadly, the low wages and insecure work patterns she endures make it impossible to save enough to pursue a new career. As Tracey explains: “I’ve done cleaning jobs where you never know what you are going to get paid. I had one job where they said it’s £ per hour but I came out with £ £ per hour because of admin and agency fees. “There’s no sick pay, no benefits and you don’t have a contract, so there are no guarantees.  “I’ve had jobs that have lasted a day, jobs that have lasted a week. “I’d like to retrain but getting the money together is impossible.” The mum-of-two is one of an estimated , people working as cleaners in the UK, many of them via an agency or outsourcing company, including many migrant workers.    Next montha new film from director Ken Loach highlights the problems faced by gig economy workers like Tracey.

She lives in Mansfield, Notts, with her two children and recently set up her own company to leave the gig economy behind. “Now I am actually self-employed,” she says. “In the past I was told I was but I wasn’t – I was just working without benefits. “We had to invoice rather than get a payslip, but they still told us where to be and when.  “You had to use your own transport and didn’t get paid for travel time. There was no sick pay –you were ill you took it as holiday.” One of those campaigning for better terms for gig economy workers, including cleaners, is the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain .

Fewer people were likely to have died in the fire had residents been evacuated while it was still possible, an official report into the tragedy said. The public inquiryaposs first report into the blaze, due to be published on Wednesday but seen by the PA news agency, identied systemic failures by the London Fire Brigade . These include the brigadeaposs stay-put strategy when residents were told to remain in their flats by firefighters and  operators for nearly two hours after the blaze broke out just before am. It also accused the brigadeaposs commissioner Dany Cotton of remarkable insensitivity after she said she would not have done anything dferently on the night. Inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said fewer people may have diedkey decisions had been made earlier, and made a number of recommendations following the two-year investigation into how the disaster at the west London tower block unfolded.    In the report, Sir Martin said the principal reason the flames shot up the building at such speed was the combustible aluminium composite materialcladding with polyethylene cores which acted as a source of fuel. The  were added in the refurbishment of the tower before to the June,  fire. The report also concluded the fire, in which  people died, started as the result of an electrical fault in a large fridge-freezer in a fourth floor flat. Sir Martin said Behailu Kebede, who had lived in the flat, bore no blame for the fire. Survivors had previously urged the judge to make a point of formally exonerating the resident, who was offered police protection after  reports of his culpability circulated online. The judge said he had not intended to investigate whether the building complied with regulations at this stage, but there was already compelling evidence the external walls did not. Instead of adequately resisting the spread of fire, they actively promoted it, he said.    Sir Martin also criticised the London Fire Brigade for its stay-put strategy when residents were told to remain in their flats by firefighters and  operators for nearly two hours after the blaze broke out just before am. The strategy was rescinded at .am. Sir Martin said: That decision could and should have been made between .am and .am and would be likely to have resulted in fewer fatalities. The best part of an hour was lost before Assistant Commissioner Roe revoked the aposstay putapos advice. He added: I identy a number of serious shortcomings in the response of the LFB, both in the operation of the control room and on the incident ground. It is right to recognise that those shortcomings were for the most part systemic in nature.  Sir Martin also said the LFBaposs preparation and planning for a fire such as that at Grenfell Tower was gravely inadequate. He praised the heroics and bravery of inidual firefighters, but described the stay put strategy as an article of faith within the LFB so powerful that to depart from it was to all intents and purposes unthinkable. And he said those giving advice to trapped residents during  calls were not aware of the danger of assuming that crews would always reach callers - a key lesson from the Lakanal House fire in , when six people died.

Itaposs going to be cloudy across south-west England, and there could be one or two showers in the south east.    Despite the sunny weather, the Environment Agency still has  flood warnings - meaning flooding is likely - and  alerts - meaning it is possible - in force today.  Since the clocks went back on Saturday night, the sun will rise at just before am and sunset will be around .pm.

Lee, who has worked at the pub for four years and claims the footage is unedited as he said: The camera is close to the bar area and I was around there setting up after breakfast.    I was checking the CCTV to see where my colleague, Molly was as we were cleaning and preparing for the day ahead. I saw the outline of what appeared to be a ghost which caused me to jump back shocked, thinking aposwhat on earth is that apos Molly walked past none the wiser, so I called her and she came and looked at the footage. She was as startled as I was.    Customers have previously reported paranormal activity including hearing a child crying in the room upstairs. Lee is more convinced after Molly said she aposfelt someone behind herapos. I donapost believe in ghosts but that footage is pretty convincing, he added. A lot of people are saying itaposs the light glaring through the window and someone said it could be cobwebs but there arenapost any.  It looks like a small girl in a dress. It was very strange, especially with Halloween this weekend.He also claimed a few other colleagues have reported ghost sightings in the past.The clip has clearly left some viewers shaken including Tasha Cushley-Gee who wrote on Facebook : “Always thought this place was haunted."},{"url":null,"title":"mum blasts school photographer charging","story":"NewsMum blasts school photographer charging to airbrush photos of pupils aged eightSam Walker hit out at the school photo price list which offered options to remove blemishes and whiten teethShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  OCT NewsMum-of-two Sam complained to the school after receiving the price list \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

There are two levels offered!! What the.... ! Have complained! What eight-year-old needs to be paranoid about an aposuneven skin toneapos. The post sparked a huge reaction from fellow parents, gaining , retweets and more than , likes. One said: That is genuinely shocking. I mean seriously. With the mental health crisis kids are facing they don’t need this kind of message.   I love the fact my kids’ school pictures are generally awful.

She’d been airbrushed! Looked like she had makeup on.  Others stuck up for the photographer, arguing: I had severe acne in middle school.

The -year-old had handed the man outside the Paragon Hotel her ID before he confronted her about the hijab. “He pointed to my hijab and said ‘take it off’,” she claimed in a blog post on website Why. Ms Iqbal said the request left her “in shock” and when she failed to respond in disbelief, she said the bouncer again repeated his demand in a more aggressive tone.    “‘What is that  Take it off’,” she claimed the bouncer then said. Ms Iqbal writes that she told the employee that it was her hijab and when she didn’t comply, she was asked to stand aside and refused entry. “I felt humiliated, I felt violated,” she said.

His game time amounted to just seven games for United.The cutting also revealed that, earlier that year, Dundee wanted to sign Williamson from Aberdeen while trying to offload Robinson to Hearts.Robinson, who had one cap for Scotland, refused that move, so the move for Williamson at that time stalled as the Dens Parkers were planning on using the fee from Hearts to fund the move.Footnote – I use the word ‘Footnote’ as at the bottom of the aforementioned cutting it was titled thus.It had nothing to do with the above-mentioned players but informed readers that a young Dundee United player, Alan Boath, had left Tannadice and moved to Forfar Athletic.I relay this tale simply because Alan has been very supportive of this column and has contributed on a few occasions.Alan emigrated to New Zealand not long after and enjoyed a long and great career over there.He represented NZ in the  World Cup in Spain, where one of his opponents was Scotland."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/medw-party-in-pink-zumba-6.jpg ","title":"dancers party in pink for charity at dundee international sports centre","story":"A #Party in Pink# dance event has taken place for charity.The annual Zumbathon for breast cancer charities took place at Dundee International Sports Centre.Also at the event was Aimi Munro, a Boobette with cancer charity CoppaFeel.Aimi shared some of her story and let people know what CoppaFeel is all about. vw, px\"  She said: “For me, being part of Coppafeel for five years has been like therapy.“Being a Boobette and being able to share my story and possibly encourage and empower even just one person to check their boobs is amazing.“I’m grateful to be able to share the inspirational work of Coppafeel.”There are only five Boobettes in Scotland. vw, px\"  Anyone interested in joining, male or female, can apply when applications open in January.Organiser Gillian Wallace said: “The fundraiser is something that Zumba does every year.“We run Party in Pink in October to try to promote breast cancer awareness.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/19595097-940x555.jpg ","title":"dundee united 2 0 dunfermline clark comes back to haunt pars as utd stay top","story":"Nicky Clark turned in a man-of-the-match display against his former team Dunfermline to help Dundee United to a vital - win and cement their place at the top of the table.The former Pars hitman teed up Lawrence Shankland for the opener on nine minutes before curling in a tremendous free-kick on  minutes to win the Tangerines all three points and keep top spot in the Championship outright.United manager Robbie Neilson made three changes from the - defeat at Queen of the South with Jamie Robson, Peter Pawlett and Clark coming in for Paul Watson, Sam Stanton and Louis Appere.Unbeaten in their last four, Dunfermline only showed one dference to their starting XI with Andy Ryan coming in for Kevin Nisbet for the Tannadice clash.And it was United who started strongest as they took the lead on nine minutes.Liam Smith#s initial delivery from the right caused Cammy Gill in the Pars goal to flap at the ball and when Clark launched it back into the box, Shankland made no mistake from six yards out to net his th United goal of the season.Two minutes later Dunfermline threatened to net a quick equaliser but Benjamin Siegrist in the home goal was a match for Ryan#s header.

We were far too passive, no one made a tackle and we’ve only got ourselves to blame.“We cannot look at anyone . If you’re in a team as a defender you need to put a foot in and make challenges when you’re called upon and we didn’t do that.“None of us were aggressive enough or seemed sharp enough.“Celtic got too much time. Edouard,Rogic,Forrest,McGregor all got too much time.”McKenna admitted the Aberdeen dressing room wasn’t a nice place to be at the break.Boss McInnes made two changes for the second half, taking off wingers Connor McLennan and Niall McGinn for James Wilson and fit-again Craig Bryson.The experienced Bryson in centre-midfield offered a semblance of leadership in the second period as the Hoops took their foot of the pedal. The makesht midfield of defenders Zak Vyner and Greg Leigh had been overrun in the first  minutes.McKenna described half-time as “very flat”.He said: “Obviously the manager spoke most of the time.“He was just trying to get some sort of reaction out of us for the second half to stop the bleeding a wee bit, because there was no way we were getting back in the game from there.“We can only apologise , whether they want to listen or not.“It’s not good enough and we’re all aware of that.“We’ve gone from the highs of last week, scoring three good goals, to being - down very quickly and - down before half-time. We can only apologise.“I know it’s said all the time in football, but the next game’s coming quick and we can only try to put it behind us.”McKenna’s disbelief was compounded by the fact Aberdeen had a week to prepare for the Premiership leaders’ visit, while the Hoops had taken on Lazio in the Europa League on Thursday.He added: “We had a good week’s training and an extra day than Celtic during the week – everything was leaning in our favour.”McKenna knows it’s imperative Aberdeen work out why they played the way they did to give them something to take into tomorrow’s clash with Hamilton – with nine points in the next three games against Accies, Kilmarnock and Ross County his aim.The Reds are now fth in the ision and he said: “We need to . There’s no point in talking about each other behind each other’s backs. It needs to be in a group and constructive.“We’re all aware it isn’t good enough. We need to find the answers – why weren’t we aggressive  Why weren’t we pressing when we were meant to be  Why were we too deep “The only good thing is we’ve got a match tomorrow.“We’ve got three games before the international break. The only way we can recover from Sunday is to take nine points out of nine.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/grittersssss.jpg ","title":"gritters out in force across aberdeen tonight as temperatures drop1","story":"Gritters will be out on Aberdeen#s main roads this evening as temperatures are set to drop.Ten gritters will be pre-treating routes from about pm as temperatures are set to fall to C overnight.Major bus routes, roads at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, and roads near fire stations will be treated first. vw, px\"  Aberdeen City Council’s early morning and standby gritting operations officially start on  November, however gritters have been out and about on Aberdeen#s roads in the last couple of weeks as new drivers have been trained and new routes tested.The council has stockpiled around , tonnes of salt and  staff will be on hand to treat the roads and pavements.They have also vowed to ensure almost half of the city’s  miles of roads are treated before .am.Early morning and standby gritting operations start will run through to  March, and operations will be extended depending on road conditions andforecasts are showing wintry weather.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: “The temperatures are due to get very cold tonight so our gritters are out this evening carrying out pre-gritting.“We cannot be everywhere around the city at the same time however the primary routes which are the main roads will be gritted.“We’d ask motorists to be prepared for their own journeys by keeping a close check on weather forecasts, plan appropriately, ensuring they have the right equipment for their journeys, adhering to police and travel advice, and having an alternative plan for transport.”Roads and pavements in the city are prioritised for gritting according to their need."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.42615302-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.42615302-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.42615302-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.42615302-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"two aberdeen roads to shut for resurfacing work","story":"Two Aberdeen roads are to close temporarily while resurfacing works are carried out.Golf Road in Bieldside will be shut from its junction with North Deeside Road and Marchbank Road will be closed from its junction with Bieldside Station Road from tomorrow at am until pm on November .There will also be a prohibition of waiting for any vehicle on either side of the streets during the same period as city council workers carry out resurfacing work.A statement from Aberdeen City Council said: “The restrictions are necessary to protect public safety during Aberdeen City Council carriageway resurfacing.”Meanwhile, vehicles will be unable to park on Urquhart Road between its junctions with Park Road and Roslin Street from .am on November  until pm on November  while carriageway remedial works are carried out."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor september 6 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDear Mr O#Hara,I write to you regarding your recent undated, round-robin constituency letter and its misleading, generalising and obviously politically biased contents.This is to mention nothing of its scaremongering phraseology and use of expressions such as #crash out# of Europe.Are you seriously suggesting thatwe do not always agree with the Germans that they would stop buying our whisky, fish and tweeds  Or are they not wishing to sell their cars and wine to us  Or visit us as holiday-makers I think not.Your party political bias is only too obvious and you should remember that while you were voted in as MP, it was only by a minority of Argyll and Bute residents, and certainly not by the majority of us.In your snide comments about Boris Johnston # of whom I, too, am not a fan # you give not a single example to back up your contention that he is #causing serious economic and social harm to both Argyll and Bute and Scotland as a whole#.While no-one expects the truth from politicians in general, we do actually expect it at a local level.R Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,The Scottish SPCA is urging the people of Scotland to share their stories, photos and memories of the charity as it prepares to celebrate its th birthday.Set up with the goal of aiding overworked horses and ponies in Leith, Scotland’s animal welfare charity was founded on  December .The Scottish SPCA now has nine animal rescue and rehoming centres and a world-leading wildle hospital in Clackmannanshire. Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre.

The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s. Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood.

Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness.

As Dinah Washington once sang, what a dference a day makes.In their first game on Tuesday the Jerry Hatricks won -. Goals from Johnston, Anderson and Litster gave a renewed sense of hope.The second match v Algarve Tavira though was all about the captain. A fabulous five goal haul and a carpet burn saw them run out - winners.Match three versus Browns from Vilamoura was always going to be a tough test and thanks to a fantastic rearguard action from Sneddon and MacDonald, allied to goals from Litster and Johnston, Jerry Hatricks came out - victors.Knowing that victory in the penultimate match against the Lagos Tigers would all but see them through it was left to Kilcolm to make his mark. A fantastic solo effort in a - win capped a great team performance. Tom would have run around with the customary shirt over the head celebration, however he found the snug fit just too much to pull over his head.By the time the final game took place the team had both done enough and run out of steam. Victory was secured and Captain Anderson#s coat was no longer on that shoogly peg.Ex Liverpool legends John Aldridge and Alan Kennedy were on hand to present the trophy.

further improvements are required across much of the local authorityambitious savings plans and satisfaction ratings are to be met.Audit Scotland carried out a major review into Scottish Borders Council between January and May.As well as interviewing councillors and senior officers, auditors sat in on meetings, reviewed documents and files, and held meetings with trade union representatives.While the resulting -page report card highlights an improving picture since the previous audit in , bosses have been told to communicate better and form better relationships with partners, such as NHS Borders.The report also highlights required improvements in some departments and the need for elected councillors to be better equipped for the tough decisions they face.Graham Sharp, chair of the Accounts Commission, told us: ldquoThe continued progress Scottish Borders Council has made to transform services is encouraging.\"Now it must focus on several critical areas including tackling underperforming services, ensuring councillors have the right training to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities and getting to grips with both staff and community engagement.Across the  performance indicators used in the Best Value Assurance Report, Scottish Borders Council was found to be below average in more than half.While education and social work are doing well, other aspects of the local authority arent quite making the grade.A lack of investment in creating employment and boosting tourism was criticised, as was the low amount of contracts awarded to local companies and the fall in the number of bills settled within  days.The deteriorating condition of local authority buildings was also highlighted.Problems since the outsourcing of IT services to multinational firm CGI - a -year contract worth pound million - were also raised by auditors.While the report identies the delays and issues which plagued customer access of the councils online services, auditors said it was too soon to gauge the impact of iPads taking over more traditional teaching methods in Borders schools from this year.And the methodology of farming out senior staff, such as the Executive Director for Commercial Activity spending four days of his week as managing director of the failed SB Cares, and the Executive Director for Strategic Partnerships seconded to the South of Scotland Enterprise Agency three days each week, was also questioned.The report stated: \"While this is a positive and innovative approach aimed at realising the councils wider ambitions, it must continue to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to deliver local services.\"But, perhaps, coming in for the most criticism was the current culture of secrecy and the need for better communication and engagement with staff, councillors and the public.The report stated: \"The council should be more effective in evaluating, managing and reporting its performance, bringing greater clarity on where and how its services need to improve.\"It also needs to get better at the reporting of performance - both in terms of information considered by members and in reporting to the public.\"Budgeting at the local authority, though, was applauded by auditors.And, during extremely dficult economic times, the managing to maintain its usable reserves in case of emergencies was also identied.Although Audit Scotland identied further development was needed for the ambitious Fit for  mid-term savings plan, which aims to trim pound. million from budgets by , the report is complimentary of cost cutting to date.The report stated: \"The council has a good record of achieving savings and has reflected the impact of demographic change on demands for services and pay increases for staff, in its financial plans.\"However, in common with all other councils, the financial outlook remains a signicant challenge.\"Council chief executive Tracey Logan welcomed the detailed analysis of her local authority.And she admitted many of the problems in the Audit Scotland report are already being tackled.She told us: \"We will take on board Audit Scotlandrsquos feedback and recommendations, many of which we had already identied ourselves and are taking action on, and continue to drive forward transformational change across all our services through our Fit for

Council will be asked rethink its controversial playparks proposals, following two petitions that were signed by over a thousand concerned residents.In May , the council agreed plans to consult on the possible closure of  small playparks it says are underused and falling into disrepair.Instead, the council plans to spend poundm over the next decade on six large playparks, three skateparks and four fitness shelters.However, following a backlash from residents in Hawick and Kelso, two petitions have been handed into the local authority objecting to the plans.Nine Kelso playparks are at risk of closure: High Croft Meadow Court Orchard Park Rosewood Gardens Springwood Rise Spylaw Park Sydenham Court Woodside Gardens and the Kelso petition has attracted  signatures.Ten playparks are at risk in Hawick: Bowden Road Burnfoot School Hawick Green Hislop Gardens Leaburn Drive Mayfield Millers Knowe Waverley Walk Wellington Court and Wilson Drive and the Hawick petition has attracted  signatures.Those petitions were presented to the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee today, October , so it could hear from the lead petitioners and decide how to respond.Appearing before the committee, Kirsty Wichary, lead petitioner for Kelso, told councillors: ldquoWhat do we want our towns to look like in the future  Financial constraints aside, do we not look to have a beautul Borders, with outdoor spaces for all to enjoy ldquoHow did we get to this point, where there is no money for these parks  Investing in new technology for education is to be applauded, butparents had a choice, which would they choose ldquoTechnology isnrsquot helping our children to lead healthy, well-rounded lives. The stress of being a youngster in the st century is enormous.ldquoWe should be investing in more play areas and green spaces instead of taking them away.ldquoThe thought of removing these playparks seems a very backwards step, a step towards a cultural desert and a future for our youngsters with more weight problems, more mental health issues and future generations unable to communicate effectively, even within their own peer groups.ldquoDo you really want to be remembered as the council who handed out iPads but took away the parks Hawickrsquos lead petitioner, Greg Dalgliesh, owner of the townrsquos Think Fitness  Less gym in Hawick, was unable to attend the meeting due to a family bereavement, soHawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer presented his petition on his behalf.He told the committee: ldquo mainly local residents, parents and family members in Hawick have chosen to exercise their right to object to a proposal that would see  playparks across the Scottish Borders, including  in Hawick, the largest town in the Borders, effectively close as a result of a disinvestment of financial support from this council.ldquoThe vast majority of these people and the many who support this action through other means are stakeholders in Scottish Borders Council. They live here, they are required to pay their council tax and, consequently, they have a right to determine how that money should be spent.ldquoI quote from the petition: lsquowe believe in this instance lsquobigger and better facilitiesrsquo should not be justication to remove the smaller playparks that are situated in the ious housing estates in Hawick and the Borders.ldquolsquoIt is very clear from the comments associated with this petition and via social media these smaller parks are still well used and have been described as a safe place to play and exercise on the doorstep of many homes.ldquo lsquoNot everyone can access the likes of Wilton Lodge Park on a regular basis, and children with additional needs also find these areas too busy and noisyrsquo.Councillors discussed a number of possible actions including sending the playpark proposals back out to the public for further consultation and gauging the opinion of community councils in affected areas.In the end, councillors voted to support sending a motion to the next full council meeting, scheduled for Thursdayasking it to reconsider giving authority to officers to determine which playparks can be closed.That motion was proposed by Tweeddale East councillor Heather Anderson and seconded by Selkirkshire councillor Elaine Thornton-Nicol.A counter motion, proposed by East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton and seconded by Jedburghrsquos Scott Hamilton, was also put forward, but it lost out to Ms Anderson and Ms Thornton-Nicolrsquos suggestionby five votes to three.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Wichary said: ldquoIrsquom very happy that itrsquos going to have to go back to the council to be reconsidered.ldquoIrsquom assuming, hopefully, that our petitions in both Kelso and Hawick have given them a lot of food for thought and that we wonrsquot see the closure of all the parks that were mentioned.ldquoItrsquos very clear that there are cost implications, but Irsquom quite confident that there will be some sort of compromise made.Mr McAteer added: ldquoI am delighted that the majority of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee have supported the Hawick petition

And a reminder that Im not getting any younger as I try to grow old gracefully.JCCs, now a septuagenarian, style has remained a constant.His image of the suit, shagpile black hair and sunglasses remain intact. His social realism poetic constructs seem relevant today as they did during his inception, extrapolated initially from the often nihilism and tales of social decay that earmarked punk mark one.Poetry is often a barometer of an epoch or epochs. Combining observation and the written word. JCC has become a master of mind imagery, social commentary, surrealism, and semantics and above all story telling. We get it because it resonates with us.It is us or we know someone who it references. Sometimes dystopian, often hilarious and never dull. Add the heavy Salfordian brogue the chemistry set is complete.The performance was slightly peculiar to what I was expecting.Maybe my expectations were misguided or unrealistic. There were some long periods of stand-up comedy that laboured at times.It was only when \"Johnny\" ed to his natural home of poetry recital that he got back on track. Though his joke about Billy Bragg being in crisis because he hadnt released an album in two weeks, I found amusing.But when he got back to the poetry it was a reminder why most people were here.Most poems were from the back catalogue and instantly recognisable. A greatest hit set list.JCC proceeded with Hire Car and the sharply expletive named Get Back on Drugs You Fat F***.Well it was an adult show after all.Common language for common poetry. And it never did Billy Connelly any harm. The poem insinuating it was easier to lose weight being on drugs.Beasley Street, arguably his most well-known poem received one of the best reactions of the night. Imbued with the description of a rock bottom street, a dreg of society and where everything that could go wrong did in this street. A caricature of a threadbare existentialism. Mainly bought on by social and economic deprivation.And then a natural supersession in the form of an epilogue Beasley Street Bouled recital, as the street had now changed into middle class suburbia.Next up Ive Fallen in Love with My We. A reference to marriage, the vows and marital bliss. Tongue in cheek of course.The \"bloody song\" Evidently Chickentown, was greeted with widespread applause. More nihilistic scorn and deprecation of a town, that is in a state of dys.Funny how we tend to laugh at the misfortune of others. But we do.Twat was another poem that represented consistency in tonights performance. A crowd pleaser for all times. Twat being the ultimate character assassination and castout. Bringing sporadic fits of laughter within the audience.The closing recital I Wanna Be Yours, famously adopted by The Arctic Monkeys for one of their songs, represented a slight U-turn in the writing of JCC. More linked to a character who wishes to show an undying love for someone . The positives of the human condition. Did I detect some optimism!The MacArts performance had poetry that mixes modernity with the historical. Comedic in value.When we laugh, we are laughing at ourselves. With him, not at him.

There are many people walking around freely drinking during these times.ldquoThis makes it dficult to identy those young people who are underage drinking when there are such crowds.Another wrote: ldquoIntoxication in these areas is unpleasant to witness. In all cases we are entitled not to be subject to the loudness and antisocial behaviour this leads to.On the other hand, some respondents voiced their concerns about bringing in alcohol bylaws: ldquoI think itrsquos a complex situation which deserves time and thought. Irsquom not entirely sure that reacting in a retrospective way is the best approach.ldquoI feel there are many behaviours and traditions entrenched in Scottish and Borders society around drinking habits.ldquoI feel personally that there are alternatives for many people socially that do not centre around drinking or going to the pub, such as the cinema, concerts, sports, dining out, etc., but not everyone has the imagination or willingness to explore these as valid ways to enjoy yourself.Another objector wrote: ldquoDrinking in public places doesnrsquot cause a problem in itself. Issues arise when certain iniduals drink alcohol to excess in any setting.ldquoThe problem, in my view, wonrsquot be solved by a blanket ban on alcohol in public spaces. There are already laws to prevent antisocial behaviour but they need enforced.Police Scotland also provided a detailed response to the consultation. It reads: ldquoAlcohol bylaws are used within the three other local council areas within Lothian and Borders, namely East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.ldquoBy having such bylaws in force it assists Police Scotland in reducing anti-social behaviour and violence both of which are known to have an association with drinking in public.ldquoCurrently the Scottish Borders area is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.NHS Borders, Borders Alcohol and Drug Partnership and Scottish Borders Children and Young Peoplersquos Leadership Group provided a joint response, which reads: ldquoAlcohol consumption can take place in our communitiesrsquo private space as well as within licensed premises.ldquoNot allowing people to drink in a public place will help to reduce the normalisation of alcohol being an ordinary commodity and builds communities and environments that supports a culture change and reduces exposure for our children and young people.ldquoPublic drinking can adversely affect the quality of le for residents and our communities.ldquoAlcohol Focus Scotland report that one in two Scots experience harm from anotherrsquos drinking and often this harm is experienced in public spaces .ldquoIn this study % had experienced harm to others in public places and this was mostlyexperienced by the younger age group .ldquoAlcohol bylaws can be used as an additional tool to reduce the nuisance and disorder normally associated with public drinking.ldquoLicensed premises are well regulated within the Scottish Borders and provide the opportunity to consume alcohol in a safe environment.ldquoThe Scottish Borders is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.Councillors will now be asked whether to conduct further consultation on two options: a blanket ban on public drinking to cover the whole of the Borders, or the introduction of an alcohol ban in certain areas of the Borders. Police Scotland has indicated it would prefer the first option, to ease the enforcement of the ban.Furthermore, councillors are asked to consider undertaking a pilot scheme in specic towns, which could then be used to gather further feedback from the public."},{"url":null,"title":"golden-granny-hilde-aims-fashion-success","story":"AN archery gold medal winning grandmother at the British Transplant Games is setting her sights on fashion.Hilde Paxton from Clovenfords, who had a liver transplant shortly after her th birthday, struck the bulls-eye at Newport earlier this year.And the -year-old is already preparing to defend her title next year by raising vital funds for her Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team.Hilde is hosting a fashion show on Saturday, November  in Galashiels.She told us: \"Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team has around  members from all over the east of Scotland who take part in the Transplant Games.\"An important part of being a member is helping to raise the funds required for sending members to the British Transplant Games.\"The Colours Fashion Team will take to the Focus Centre boardwalk on the Saturday for an evening of glamour and casual wear.Included in the pound ticket price is a complimentary glass of Prosecco on arrival.As well as the fashion show, there will also be a grand raffle and a licensed bar.Tickets for Hildes fashion show, which starts at .pm for pm, are available from the Salmon Inn and Focus Centre, Galashiels, the Bridge Inn and The Gt Shop, Peebles, or The Hub in Innerleithen."},{"url":null,"title":"top-up-tap-plans-galashiels","story":"GALASHIELS is set to become the first town in the Borders to receive an official top-up tap.Scottish Water has already installed the water stations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Ayr, Oban and Fort William as part of its Your Water, Your Le initiative.As well as providing healthy drinking water, the refill taps will also reduce the number of plastic bottles which are currently in circulation.Scottish Water now want to install the top-up tap in Market Place -

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council.

forward include allowing the countyrsquos schools to switch their scheduled May holiday from May  to May  and either ldquolook sympathetically on any requests from non-school staff who want to take the day off to mark the occasion or move the September bank holiday to May  for other workers.The option of changing the school holiday would benefit the council as the Scottish Qualications Authority has scheduled exams for May  next year, which would mean some staff having to work that day.But while those options have been supported by teaching union the EIS, Unison has said it prefers another option which would see the date given as an additional holiday.A report due to be considered by councillors next week warns that adding an extra dayrsquos holiday could cost up to pound, in additional payments.It also warned that an extra holiday for the schools would require permission from the Scottish Government as it would reduce the year for pupils to  days.Councillors will be told that

under way at the site, near the A, ahead of the eye-catching piece of artwork being put in place.Original proposals suggested Apollo, the Greek and Roman god of the sun, could find a home on the Spott roundabout on the busy road.However, it was eventually decided that a bear, designed by renowned Scottish artist Andy Scott, would be created on land near the townrsquos Asda store and McDonaldrsquos restaurant, east of the roundabout.The sculpture will stand on top of a mound of earth.Ken Ross, from Hallhill Development Ltd, which is behind the proposals, told the Courier work was under way, with

Aberdeenrsquos Marischal Square.Work was delayed slightly to allow the re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar to take place last month.The sculpture, which is made of welded steel and fabricated from steel plates of ious thicknesses, is a nod towards John Muir, who was born in the town before emigrating to the USA and playing a key role in the formation of the countryrsquos national park system.Planning permission for the sculpture was originally turned down by East Lothian Council after concerns were raised that the work of art would be a distraction to drivers on the A.The decision was appealed to the local authorityrsquos local review body, where Dunbar and East Linton ward member Sue Kempson said: ldquoI find the links with John Muir extremely tenuous and I donrsquot find it particularly attractive.However, ward colleague Councillor Norman Hampshire was backed by the committeersquos other two members ndash Jeremy Findlay and Stuart Currie ndash in backing the plans, which were then given final approval by the Scottish Government, with conditions from Transport Scotland.Discussions surrounding the sculpture have been ongoing for more than two years, with the plans splitting the townrsquos community council when they were discussed.Pippa Swan, now chairwoman of the group, originally said: ldquoFor me it is a bizarre proposal and it looks like a polar bear or like an advertisement for a safari park.Fellow community councillor Herbert Coutts was more positive and pointed to the impact of the Kelpies and the Angel of the North, near Gateshead.He said: ldquoI

Despite the objection of the Democratic Unionist Partyand anti-abortion crusaders, it was ruled that from midnight it would be legal to have an abortion in Northern Ireland, as in the Republic of Ireland, as in the rest of the UK.With the passage of this legislation, women in the first  weeks of pregnancy who wish to have a termination will no longer have to skulk out of the country, or purchase online pills, rendering them open to prosecution should these make them so unwell they require medical attention.After next April, following an interim period during which access to services on the mainland will be freely available, the situation in Northern Ireland will change radically. Those who are pregnant as a result of incest or rape those who know their foetus has an incurable disease that will allow them little quality of le for as long as they survive those who have been told they must go full term, even though the baby has died, will finally be given a degree of dignity and comfort. At last, they will be able to end a pregnancy of their own volition, in their homeland, without stigma and with the full support of the medical professionals who tend to them.It is a not a subject for wild rejoicing, as was evident in the sombre response of campaigners on learning the law had been passed. The mood was more of relief than jubilation. Nobody can feel joy at the idea of a pregnancy that, for whatever reason, is better ended.But it is possible to feel gratitude that an old and crippling injustice, a hangover of a puritanical stranglehold on womenrsquos lives, has been overturned. As of now, Northern Irish women are entitled to decide on their own welfare and that of their unborn child. It is a right that is not only legal but ethical.That these new laws are among the most liberal in Europe is remarkable, given the strength and tenacity of opposition to this issue. It must exacerbate the fury of the anti-abortion camp to watch the political mothership in London impose its will with such vigour.That this has happened under a Conservative government with which the DUP was in partnership, is an added grievance. As is the fact that even the Republic of Ireland, once a by-word for religious conservatism, last year voted to allow terminations . This volte face was salt in the wound for pro-lers and pro-choice activists alike.The measure of how historic this landmark will prove can be gauged by the opening of the padlock on the Assemblyrsquos gates. Sinn Fein did not turn up, but Arlene Forster, leader of the DUP, announced that, despite this act, her party would explore ldquoevery possible legal option to prevent the provision of abortion services within their borders.A fuming zealot was less restrained: ldquoin todayrsquos world the most dangerous place to be is actually in the womb of a woman. There could hardly be a more calculated insult to womankind, but the depth of this manrsquos misogyny highlights the intensity of prejudice and oppression with which the pro-choice lobby has had to contend.This momentous step is good news for the United Kingdom, as is impending legislation to allow same-sex marriage from next January. All this is positive. Yet it is a sad day for the Union that both decisions, which will have far-reaching social implications, are not the work of Irish politicians but of Westminster.Since the Assembly collapsed in January , its day to day business has been handled by civil servants. You might argue they are doing such a good job they are enabling Sinn Fein and the DUP to maintain their stand-off. That not even the murder of the journalist Lyra McKee could encourage these parties to put aside their quarrel indicates the bitterness and ision at the heart of Irish politics.Yet while the Assembly has been lying all these months in an induced coma, London has not been idle. Those on the pro-choice side of the debate might have mixed feelings, since their argument has been vindicated thanks to action by the English. Time was when anything that came out of Westminster was regarded in certain quarters as toxic. How ironic, then, that the Assemblyrsquos denizens have allowed their internal wrangling, their myopia and obstinacy, to allow an often loathed overlord to step into their shoes and usher voters into a more compassionate age.That must be galling for everyone. Then again, perhaps not. When Stormont reconvened for the space of roughly an hour, squabbling made any hope of constitutional challenge impossible. It was hardly edying. Rather than acting as a reminder that the Assemblyrsquos members have the power to settle the countryrsquos affairs without interference from outside, it was instead a shambles, a pantomime whose script had been lted straight from the myth of Pandorarsquos Box.I would not be surprised , following this, some are wonderingthey should dispense with the Assembly altogether, since they are better served by panjandrums across the sea. Others, meanwhile, will be looking south towards the Republic, anticipating the time when old isions are lted, and all of Ireland is united peacefully once more.What lies between now and that day, should it ever arrive, will be turbulent, to say the least. For the meantime, it is paradox enough that it has taken Westminster to unlock the chains in which Northern Irelandrsquos women have been shackled. The symbolic signicance of this long overdue act should give the refusniks at Stormont pause for thought."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10590284.jpg?type=article-full","title":"guide-cosiest-pubs-around-scotland","story":"Cugravel Cugraveil, GlasgowYou canrsquot get much cosier than Cugravel Cugraveil - Glasgowrsquos only heated and covered City Centre winter garden.The Cugraveils cosy, intimate vibe and unique atmosphere is second to none.

But Britainrsquos adversarial system was supposed to preclude that. Until now.Thanks to the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the government canrsquot simply call an election when it chooses, or when it loses votes in the Commons, as this one has done repeatedly. It has to win a two-thirds majority, which places the initiative in the hands of the opposition.Alternatively, a government of national unity could take over after a confidence vote, which comes to the same thing.Labour has been demanding a General Election for the past two years, but somehow canrsquot quite get round to voting for one, or moving a vote of no confidence in the government.In a very real sense, the opposition has been keeping this government on le support.Jeremy Corbyn said he wouldnrsquot vote for a General Election until a no-deal Brexit, which Boris Johnson had threatened for October , was ldquotaken off the table by the Benn Act.The Benn Act passed, the letter was sent, Brussels has signalled an extension and no deal is off the table.But Labour are now saying they want no deal to be taken off the table even after that extension. It wants an indefinite extension of Article , or a law saying that the UK will never be faced with a hard Brexit.Labourrsquos justication for these transparent delaying tactics is that ldquoyou canrsquot trust anything Boris Johnson says. Well, few might disagree.But the only way to remove this serial liar is by an election. And, short of a Labour government in perpetuity, it is not possible in a democracy to rule out no deal forever.No UK government can be bound by acts of a previous administration. The only way to rule out no deal indefinitely would be to revoke Article , or vote for the deal.Labour has always voted against revocation and, indeed, condemned Jo Swinson as ldquoNigel Faragersquos little helper when the LibDem conference voted to revoke Article  without a referendum.Hopes rose and fell last week that the Remainers might finally get their repeat referendum when the Withdrawal Bill passed Second Reading.Some hoped that they could tag a referendum amendment. But it was not to be.First, there needs to be government legislation to hold a referendum, not least because it involves expense, and Boris Johnsonrsquos government will never legislate for a referendum.Second, there is no majority in the Commons for a referendum, which is why the Peoples Vote campaign decided not to try a referendum vote on Super Saturday .Third: there is no clarity on what the question would be. Remainers want the deal versus Remain. But Leave voters would never accept that.Theyrsquoll demand that no deal must be on the ballot paperRemain is on it. Donrsquot expect the Electoral Commission or the Supreme Court to sort that one out.I suppose Brussels could simply say: well, wersquoll revoke Article  for you ndash but that might look just a little like dictatorship.They canrsquot undo Article  anyway because it was triggered by that vote in the UK Parliament in  when MPs, including Labour, voted to leave by a majority of .Thatrsquos where our problems really began.French president Emmanuel Macron has made clear that the Benn Act extension until February , the third, must be justied by a ldquodemocratic event ie a General Election or a referendum.But Brexitus Interruptus has now infected Brussels as well.Last week, the EU withheld a decision on theof the extension because they want to seeParliament votes for a General Election tomorrow.But since Westminster is waiting for a ruling from Brussels on the extension, we have found ourselves on a diplomatic equivalent of MC Escherrsquos Endless Staircase.For some reason, the UK opposition parties believed Boris Johnson when he said he would rather ldquodie in a ditch than extend Britainrsquos membership of the EU beyond October .Boris Johnson is notoriously unreliable, so why they believed this is a mystery.What ditch did they expect him to fall into  Did they expect him to have a nervous breakdown and resign Johnson did what yoursquod expect him to do, which is ignore what hersquod said and reframe the question: itrsquos not him in the ditch but Labour, for refusing to agree to the General Election.ldquoBut he said hersquod never send the letter complain Labour supporters on social media.Again, Johnson just amended the record, sent the Benn letter to Brussels along with a covering note saying itrsquos not government policy and that he wouldnrsquot co-operate.Itrsquos what this column said he would do all along.Labour are now horribly exposed because they somehow didnrsquot bargain on Johnson turning the extension against them.The opposition is now split. The SNP say there is now no justication for delaying an election because no deal is off the table ndash though Ian Blackford wants one on December , not December  as the government has offered.For his part, Johnson is offering to give Parliament time to scrutinise his Withdrawal BillLabour agree to an election. But Labour still wonrsquot bite.The truth is that Labour MPs were furious when Jeremy Corbyn hinted last week that he might go for the election he has been demanding all along.Most Labour MPs hate the Labour leader and donrsquot want an election while hersquos in charge. Plus, many realise that theyrsquoll lose their seats because theyrsquove been delaying the Brexit that many Labour voters voted for.That is certainly a problem, but it is not one as likely to arouse much sympathy from the electorate.All they see is endless delay, confusion, chaos, parliamentary bickering and a Prime Minister who got a Brexit deal that no-one said he would be able to get, jeering at Labour for not agreeing to the General Election they said theyrsquod vote for once hersquod got it.Labour MPs can console themselves that the polls are bad right now.But to depend on opinion polls for an election really would be a real constitutional innovation.Perhaps we should replace the Queen with YouGov as head of state.Then at least something might happen."},{"url":null,"title":"turnaround-town-ayr-running-names-scotlands-beautiful-high-street","story":"Hit by shop closures and a lack of investment, Ayr town centre was in the running for the  Plook on the Plinth award for the most dismal town in Scotland.But, six years on, the seaside town has turned its fortunes around and is now in the process of massive regeneration.The transformation and combined effort of locals and South Ayrshire Council has led to the town being nominated for an entirely dferent award- Scotlandrsquos Most Beautul High Street.:Network Rail pursues owner of Ayr Station Hotel over track chaosThe award, run by Scotlandrsquos Towns Partnership and Keep Scotland Beautul, celebrates the best of the countryrsquos towns based on horticultural achievement, environmental responsibility, and community participation.Phil Prentice, Chief Officer of Scotlandrsquos Towns Partnership, said Ayr is in the running thanks to a massive amount of investment in the town.ldquoAyr is a beautul former market town with a long history.

To say that was a blow would be the understatement of my le.:Row over BBC Laura Kuenssberg biased anti-Sturgeon tweetFresh out of university at the time, I wasnrsquot in the least bit clued up on the  Equal Pay Act, but I knew that paying him more than me just wasnrsquot right and making that discovery was gutting. Our employers, it seemed, knew they had done wrong too: though they initially tried to dismiss my complaint on the basis that my colleague had to drive to work while I could walk, they quickly conceded that that was irrelevant and raised my pay by pound. It was hardly the stuff movies are made of, but the victory felt signicant nonetheless.And yet here we are in ,  years after a tiny victory that came  years after the Equal Pay Act was written into law, and women are still being put in the position of having to ask their employer to account for why they are being paid less than men for doing work of equal value. From council workers to news anchors, there seems to be no shortage of women for whom the law has offered no protection until they have taken action to enforce it, with BBC presenter Samira Ahmed this week becoming the latest in a long line of women forced to take a stand in the name of equality.Ms Ahmed, a freelance journalist who was formerly a reporter and presenter on Channel Four News, has for the past several years hosted a range of programmes for the BBC, including Radio rsquos daily arts show Front Row and the BBC News channelrsquos weekly points of view programme Newswatch. She has taken the broadcaster to the Central London Employment Tribunal over what it pays her to present the latter, arguing that she should get the same pound, a show that Jeremy Vine is rewarded for presenting Points of View rather than the pound an episode she has been paid since taking over the programme in .She would appear to have a point. Points of View may air on BBC One while Newswatch is available on the news channel only, but to all intents and purposes what Ms Ahmed and Mr Vine do on those programmes is broadly the same. Both are at the helm of presenter-led shows that last for  minutes, are aired once a week and offer the public the opportunity to give their views on BBC content. Sure, Jeremy Vine has to relay comments about programmes that are produced right across the BBC while Ms Ahmed handles views on news programmes only, but does that mean he deserves to be paid close to seven times as much as her for it  Does anyone really think that the situation is a fair one Well, yes, some people obviously do. Because despite being here before with former China editor Carrie Gracie - who last year was awarded yearsrsquo worth of back pay after receiving signicantly less than the men doing the same job in other parts of the world - and despite agreeing to pay Ms Ahmed more for her work on Front Row and Radio rsquos Night Waves Free Thinking - where she had been earning % and % less than her male equivalents - the broadcaster is adamant that the disparate levels of pay awarded to Mr Vine and Ms Ahmed can be justied. Their programmes, though similar, follow dferent formats, you see, with Mr Vinersquos being classed as entertainment while Ms Ahmedrsquos is seen simply as news. The fact they are shown on dferent channels has also been offered up as an excuse.:BBC lsquois facing wave of pay claim tribunalsrsquo as Ahmed case beginsThanks to the other women who have been willing to stand up and challenge the law on equal pay before her, it seems likely that Ms Ahmed could win the argument. After all, when Dumfries and Galloway Council argued in  that the salaries paid to female classroom assistants and learning support staff could not be compared to those of groundsmen and road workers it was quickly stopped in its tracks.Just because male and female employees work in dferent locations, doing dferent jobs does not mean they cannot be compared for equal-pay purposes the Supreme Courtrsquos now president Lady Hale ruled, setting a precedent that has been applied to Glasgow City Council and supermarket giant Asda in the years since. Taken in that context, the dferent-channel, dferent-format argument expected to be deployed by the BBC in the employment tribunal would seem to be more than a little bit thin.Yet proving that Ms Ahmed should be paid equally to Mr Vine evenshe can prove she works equally to him could end up being easier said than done, with employment lawyer Ross Meadows pointing out that the BBC will still have ldquoa genuine material factor defence argument in its armoury. You see while it is one thing to show that a man and woman are carrying out jobs whose value can be said to be the same, itrsquos another thing to expect them to be paid equally for them, with experience and seniority sometimes allowed to trump equality in the eyes of the law.And this is where women, despite supposedly having had the law on their side for close to  years, have been set up to fail again and again. In a working world where men continue to hold all the most senior positions, where they use those positions to hire in their image - often without ever making it known there are jobs available to compete for - women are fighting a losing battle when it comes to gaining the experience that would confer on them the seniority that gives them the right to be paid equally.Until that problem is addressed - until women are allowed to compete on the level playing field we are repeatedly told is open to us - unscrupulous bosses will always have a get-out on equal pay and the situation will continue to self-perpetuate.As she was getting ready for her tribunal hearing this week Samira Ahmed released a statement in which she noted that the back of her BBC pass is inscribed with a set of values that include showing respect for each other, celebrating ersity and taking pride in delivering quality and value for money. In light of that, she said, ldquoI just ask why the BBC thinks I am worth only a sixth of the value of the work of a man for doing a very similar job.Regardless of what the tribunal decides, it is a question we would all benefit from knowing the answer to."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-let-general-election-fought-remain-versus-revoke","story":"We feel this way for ious reasons.

I think his view is questionable on ious grounds. First, the referendum on EU membership was advisory only, not binding. The Government was not obliged to shape its policy on the referendum result and on any showing the idea of initiating as massive a constitutional change as departure from the EU on the strength of a wafer-thin majority vote was absurd. In a parallel universe, a sensible government would have responded to the referendum result by conducting a serious and academically respectable investigation into the ious forms a ldquoBrexit might take and the likely results of each of them, and putting the findings before the electorate, before even initiating the process of leaving the EU. It is nobodyrsquos duty to support a misguided and mishandled policy that can only lead to disaster.Secondly, it is surely a first principle of parliamentary democracy that members are elected to serve their constituencies. Every one of our Tory MPs is going directly against the majority of the voters they represent in their sheep-like obedience to their party line: hardly an example of democracy in action.However, this issue is really academic, since none of the MPs in question is likely to remain in office beyond the forthcoming election.Derrick McClure, Aberdeen AB.YET another extension and delay to the farcical Brexit saga, this time to January , .

Unless a complete zealot one way or the other Irsquom sure the majority of the electorate, especially the business community , are so fed up with the whole process that they just want it finalised without further dithering by our so-called politicians, who as a group surely must be the worst privileged bunch to have occupied the green benches.As it is, on and on it goes and as the end of January approaches yet another extension could be requested and granted. And so the spiral of uncertainty continues.James Martin, Bearsden.AS the damage likely to be inflicted by leaving the EU becomes daily clearerit is even more horrying to re-read Saturdayrsquos front page headline, ldquoGive us a break: Public is fed up with Brexit delays . It seems that boredom and apathy among the electorate may yet do what no amount of rational discussion could and encourage Parliament to vote through any awful deal in order to end the uncertainty.This desire for a conclusion is obviously in the interests of the tax-avoiding billionaires, racists and delusional believers in the lies about the EU peddled by much of the press during the referendum campaign. It also accords with the views of the apathetic group who, unbelievably, did not vote in the referendum. What is lesscomprehensible is that a single Remain voter could feel this way. The damage already sustained from the vote is obvious, and is nothing compared to the social and economic damage likely to follow leaving the EU whatever deal is or is not reached.Most horrying of all is the attitude expressed by Lord Haugheyand by many otherbusiness leaders. They seem to prepared to accept any deal, however bad, whereas they claim they cannot cope with uncertainty. As the future is never certain, it is curious that they think leaving the EU will somehow make it more predictable. One has to suspect that for some, at least, in the business community, slackening of workplace, consumer and environmental protection outside the EU may actually be what they want.Lord Haughey goes further, and repeats the dreadful mantra about leaving the EU being a democratic decision which must be honoured. Even he must realise this is a nonsense a decision based on a gerrymandered electorate, illegal expenditure, lies and undeliverable promises must not be allowed to dictate our future.Dr RM Morris, Ellon.WITH the prospect of a General Election in the offing, political parties are beginning their campaigns. We now know what will be the centrepiece of the SNPrsquos campaign. Both the partyrsquos leader and deputy leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford and Kirsty Blackman, announced in television interviews in recent days that the choice before Scots would be to vote for Scotland ldquoin Brexit Britain or ldquoan independent Scotland remaining in the EU. To say that this is an untruth is to put it very mildly. The EU Commission and other EU representatives have made it very clear that Scotland, as part of the UK, will leave the EU as part of the UK.The SNP leadership knows this very well. Its claim that an independent Scotland would remain in the EU is an appeal to many Scots, like myself, who deplore the fact that the UK is leaving the EU. The SNP expects to make gains in any election, based on their appeal to anti-Brexit Scots. However, Scots need to be aware that SNP literature and word of mouth propaganda that claim that Scotland could ldquoremain in the EU is thoroughly dishonest. A separate Scotland could apply to join the EU ndash that is another matter. But Scotland is not a member state of the EU: it is a part of a member state, the UK. If that member state leaves, all of it leaves, including all of its constituent parts. A Scotland that had left the UK could not ldquoremain in the EU. That is not merely my view it is the view of the EUrsquos leadership.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh EH.BREXIT chaos reigns, a major contributory factor being that next to no recognition has been given by the Conservative Government and its Brexiter supporters to the fact that in the referendum Leave won a majority of votes over Remain amounting to a tiny . per cent of the votes cast.In that context a hard Brexit with the alternative of No Deal should have been absolutely unthinkable. Boris Johnsonrsquos isive strategy has resulted in the citizens of the UK being unable to come together to heal the schisms not only within but between our nations.Who would have thought that it would be the Conservative and ldquoUnionist Party which would do such potentially irreparable damage to the unity of our country  The legs on which the Union stands are shaking, even showing signs of crumbling, and that party must accept a signicant element of the responsibility. In spite of all the talk of how important the Union is to the likes of Theresa May, polls have shown it means little in any meaningful sense to a dwindling number of the English.I campaigned for a No vote in  only to see the result being thrown away by so-called Unionists in the party of that name. I wonderthey are making independence inevitable.John Milne, Uddingston.IS anyone keeping count of the number of times our Prime Minister has had a photo opportunity in a primary school I speculate that this is because he knows he wonrsquot be asked any awkward questions.

Nothing remarkable about that.After all, hasnt Jacob Rees-Mogg survived the scandal of a scornful slouch on the green benches in the House of Commons  The Right Honourable Member took up three seats with his horizontal pose, giving the appearance of waiting for Nanny to come and tuck him in.Anna Turley, the Labour MP, called Rees-Moggrsquos lounging the ldquophysical embodiment of arrogance, entitlement, disrespect and contempt for our parliament.To be fair, the Leader of the House had had a long day, having to wait out a Brexit debate, only one of the most consequential in parliamentary history.And there was Sir Desmond Swayne last year having  winks during a speech by colleague Ken Clarke in the House of Commons. Or, a wee  seconds, as Sir Desmond later claimed. \"It happened,\" he said, expressing annoyance at himself after being pictured with his head lolling on his shoulder, \"And it wont happen again.\"His excuse, he said, was a \"very long day\". It was an interesting excuse, given that one was expecting a detailed summary of how he had been up early dealing with parliamentary business. In fact, hed been up at .am for a dip in the Serpentine before work. I cant say thats much of an excuse but Im ill equipped to judge, given Ill happily nap on the floor of a public toiletthe mood takes me.Speaking after his colleague had been caught asleep on the job, fellow Tory MP Bernard Jenkins said back in the bad old days, before Commons proceedings were first televised in , MPs used to use the Chamber for a nap.\"Its only the advent of television,\" Mr Jenkins said, \"That means you cant go in to the House of Commons and have a snooze.\"Its only the advent of smartphones turning everyone and their granny into a paparazzo that allowed Corbyn to be caught using his commute to catch up on a bit of REM.What an invasion of privacy to be photographed asleep. A mid-market newspaper published the picture with apparent disgust at Mr Corbyn snoozling away as England played the All Blacks.Despite being out for the count, a Labour spokesman said \"Jeremy followed the game and is delighted England won.\"The leader of the opposition also tweeted that the game had been \"an incredible team performance and hard-fought victory\". What a let down. Honestly being the best policy here, the politician should have tweeted his congratulations and fronted up: \"Missed the game, was having a well-earned nap.\"Cant do that, though, as its more socially acceptable to be caught fibbing than to be caught napping. The clues in the phrase: \"caught\". And why Corbyn wasnt working, he was travelling. Thats what train journeys are for, a little siesta. And bus journeys. People are less relaxed about napping while driving but folk can be funny about these things.Youre \"caught\" napping because of the negative stereotypes attached to daytime sleeping, that naps are signs of weakness and sloth. Yet who do we have in the opposite corner Maggie Thatcher advertised how little sleep she needed. Donald Trump boasts of only four hours a night. Hand me my bedsocks.In Japan Jeremy Corbyn would be praised for his diligence in working himself to the point of exhaustion. Sleeping in public is a practice known as inemuri and is more acceptable than cancelling an engagement due to fatigue.You can nap anywhere - shopping mall, cafe, public transport - as long as you arent sprawled unsociably, violating more space than you need to. Take note, Rees-Mogg.Inemuri, despite being an ancient practice, is a neat melding of the modern trend of praising the desire to be constantly, performatively busy, with holding naps as king.Its been firmly established that naps are a positive step for good physical and emotional health. In the US employers such as Nike and Google have recognised the benefit of a well rested workforce for increased production. One has nap pods in its headquarters, the other has space for sleep or meditation.Its a sensible way forward. Down with the shame of snoozing. Up with refreshing rests.If we go for a December election, Labour should run on a promise of protected nap times for workers. A sleep pod in every workplace. It would be a dream ticket."},{"url":null,"title":"fresh-funding-scottish-farming-part-160m-investment-package","story":"An initial pound million has been pledged towards active farming, with a focus on those who work in Scotlands marginal uplands, hill farms and island areas.The cash was made available by the UK Government to address what has been described by the Scottish Government as a \"historic wrong\" relating to EU Common Agricultural Policy funding - which was not passed on to Scotland between  and .Last month, Chancellor Sajid Javid confirmed the UK wouldthe pound million in funding that had been due to be paid to Scotland.It comes after the last CAP reform when the UK qualied for a pound million uplt because of Scotlands low average rate per hectare.A total of only pound million was allocated to Scotland at the time.Scottish Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing welcomed the funding ahead of the UKs exit from the EU.\"Brexit is by far the biggest threat to farming and this funding will help provide some security during these uncertain times,\" he said.\"This will then enable them to invest in their businesses, pay down debt and ultimately drive the rural economy forward.\"I have given careful consideration in deciding this approach and would like to thank everyone for their support and suggestions on how best to fairly allocate this money over the last couple of weeks.\"This approach respects the spirit in which this money was intended, and will, as far as we can achieve, close the gap in support between Scottish farmers and crofters and the EU average.\"Read more:Scottish aquaculture reigns supreme with the king of fishMr Ewing said the approach taken for allocating funding would help get money to where it needs to be.\"In allocating this funding, I am conscious of the need to adhere to the spirit and original premise of convergence,\" he said.\"This approach ensures that the money goes to where it was originally intended - with a signicant proportion going to those farming in our marginal and remote areas.\"This funding will also meet my commitment to maintain support for farmers and crofters in the Less Favoured Area.\"I believe this approach gets the money to where it needs to be and will result in all eligible farmers and crofters either increasing or signicantly increasing the money in their bank accounts.\""},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-50p-coins-shredded-melted-royal-mint","story":"The special coins were originally designed to be minted in time for Britain leaving the trading bloc this Friday.However, today the Treasury confirmed these coins would be recycled now that the EU has agreed a Brexit extension with the UK Government.:Issue of the Day: The p turns A HM Treasury Spokesman said:ldquoWe will still produce a coin to mark our departure from the European Union, and this will enter circulation after we have left.According to the Royal Mint website, precious metals, such as p coins, are sorted and shredded before being melted down.

These bus services are described as “commercial”.Local authorities such as Aberdeenshire Council have a duty to identy travel needs within their area which are not otherwise met, and secure what public transport is appropriate taking into account the funds available. These bus services are described as “supported”.In addition to funding fixed route bus services, the council supports community transport, for example dial-a-bus and voluntary car schemes operated by the voluntary sector, provides door-to-door dial-a-bus services and also provides a TaxiCard Scheme which offers a discount on taxi fares, usually £ per journey, for older and disabled residents.Chair of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “It was agreed earlier this year that the network should be reassessed by means of a ‘clean-sheet’ approach, in order to identy a more sustainable network in the longer term that will more effectively cater for otherwise unmet travel needs, assist in addressing patronage decline and provide better value for money.“I would encourage all those who currently use bus services or may require them in the future to complete this quick survey which will provide vital information for our wider consultation.”Vice-chair Councillor John Cox added: “In addition to getting the views of residents, our survey is being issued to a wide range of organisations including community councils, rural partnerships, schools and social care facilities.“That feedback will assist us in developing cost-effective, fit-for-purpose services for Aberdeenshire communities in the years to come.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Here are  of the strangest UK parking laws to be aware of to ensure you avoid being fined by authorities\"   of the strangest UK parking laws viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Further information on the council’s strategy and associated current policies for the support of passenger transport including local bus services, can be found in the Passenger Transport Strategy https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk media  passengertransportstrategy.pdfThe questionnaire will be available online from Monday, October  to Monday, December  at https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk roads-and-travel public-transport policies-strategies-and-contracts Printed copies being available in local libraries, Aberdeenshire Council offices, Ellon Park  Ride, and Peterhead Interchange, with effect from November ."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmKirkwall Leboat was called out, this afternoon, Tuesday, after a person was reported missing in Eday.

The stakes are huge, the disagreements profound, and old loyalties to political parties have already been ripped apart, with some MPs cast out of what they regard as their natural home and others leaving of their own accord.Splits have also appeared within the Leave and Remain camps. Hardline Brexiteers have long been at odds with more pragmatic fellow travellers, while the People’s Vote campaign has been rocked by internal disputes with staff walking out after two senior colleagues were asked to quit their posts. And the SNP’s Angus MacNeil, MP for the Western Isles, has attacked his party’s support for a plan to hold a general election on  December, saying it would be a “Christmas and birthday present all rolled into one” for Boris Johnson.: Brexit: UK government criticised for ‘secret’ trade meetings with US drugs firms: Brexit: EU agrees to ‘flexible extension’ as UK exit date pushed back to January As the current impasse demonstrates, democracy can be a fraught process when a great ide emerges, leading to multiple sub-isions that can become just as bitter – as famously lampooned by Monty Python in the film Le of Brian. The movement or party that manages to stay calm and respectful despite disagreements is the one most likely to succeed. Those who bitterly shun “splitters” doom themselves to irrelevance.And the same could be said for democracy as a whole. If the country is to succeed, there needs to be a basic acceptance of the right to disagree.Two years after losing the  general election – despite leading Britain to victory in the Second World War – Winston Churchill remarked: “Many forms of government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.”Whatever happens now – a general election, a second referendum, a further delay or Brexit – we must stay true to the values of democracy, regardless of how ugly things get.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"when a focus group heard this fact about brexit there was horrified silence alex cole hamilton msp","story":"The public are being duped over Brexit by both the Tories and the SNP, writes Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP.Somewhere, in a windowless room of a national opinion polling organisation, the answers offered by a recent focus group uncovered a worrying reality.When asked a series of questions about Boris Johnson’s new Brexit ‘deal’ the carefully selected cross-section of the UK public demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding as to what is actually going on. The research discovered that almost universally, those asked thought that the ‘deal’ being examined at Westminster represented not just the terms of our withdrawal from the European Union but the entirety our future trading and political relationship with the bloc.When told that this was just the beginning and that Brexit itself would trigger years of detailed, high-stakes negotiations and trade talks– the response was a “horried silence”.It demonstrates the mistaken, yet widely held belief that “getting Brexit done” will conclude with the passage of a withdrawal agreement. Yet in reality, the wrangling, the double-dealing and the persistent threat of crashing out without a deal after the transition period are set to go on and on and on.: Brexit: Boris Johnson is learning same lessons as Theresa May – Ian Swanson: Brexit: England seems to be declaring independence from UK – Angus RobertsonPart of the cause of this confusion is that very few political parties are being straight with the public right now, either about what is going on in the Brexit endgame, or how they feel about it.Take the Prime Minister. In , Theresa May proposed what was, effectively, the same withdrawal agreement as the one on the table right now. She was derided for it by both Boris Johnson and the Brexiteer wing of the Conservative Party. DoublethinkNow he is at the helm, Johnson has discovered the unassailable boundaries of Brexit and has reheated the same solution to the Irish border problem. Northern Ireland will be both simultaneously inside and outside of the EU customs union, depending on your point of view – “Schrödinger’s Ulster” as the commentator Alex Massie recently put it.Scottish Tories have rushed to embrace this policy and with it the doublethink of their new leader. When Theresa May first proposed special treatment for Northern Ireland in its relationship with the EU, Ruth Davidson and David Mundell threatened to resign their positions in response to the threat they believed it represented to the Union.But a poll of Tory members earlier this year suggested that delivering Brexit was more important to them than preventing Scottish independence. The self-proclaimed s of the Union are now pedalling a policy that dramatically heightens the risk of another Scottish border poll and all that comes with it.The mask is beginning to slip for the SNP as well. For three years, Nicola Sturgeon has sought to court Remain voters who voted No in . She’s been desperate to point to independence as a leboat back to the EU . But the First Minister’s ‘stop Brexit’ credentials are starting to ring rather hollow.It emerged last week that her party spent considerably more money chasing , votes in the Shetland by-election than they did campaigning for . million votes in the EU referendum. And people have forgotten that it took them nearly two years to join the campaign for a referendum on the final terms of Brexit. Now that a second referendum might just make it into the Withdrawal Billthey have gone strangely quiet on that front. Instead they appeared to have opted for a swashbuckling push for a snap General Election out of what appears to be a narrow self-interest.No wonder people find politics infuriating right now. They just want political parties to be straight with them about the seismic choices we face as a nation. That starts by reminding them in no uncertain terms that the best deal we could ever hope to strike with the EU is the one we currently enjoy as a full and active member and that the best way to “get Brexit done” is to do away with Brexit completely.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"general election 2019 independence referendum set to dominate debate in scotland","story":"Brexit may dominate the forthcoming UK election campaign but in Scotland the issue of independence is certain to come to the fore.First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has already declared she will put the call for a second vote on the issue at the heart of her partys campaign.She made that clear when she addressed the SNP conference in Aberdeen earlier this month.Ms Sturgeon said when the election campaign takes place her partys message will be \"clear, simple and unambiguous - vote SNP to demand independence and secure Scotlands right to choose\".: Who is likely to win  General Election She was also explicit that in the event of a hung parliament her party would make having another independence ballot an automatic condition for gaining the SNPs support.While she insisted the SNP would \"never put the Tories into power\" her message to Jeremy Corbyn was: \"If you dont respect Scotlands right to choose our own future at a time of our own choosing, dont even bother picking up the phone.\"Mr Corbyn said on a recent visit to Scotland there would be \"no pacts with any other party\".Labour, he said, would be fighting the election \"to win it in every part of the UK\".Together with the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, Labour will use the campaign to highlight their opposition to both independence and a second referendum.With people having voted for the union in  and with about one million Scots having voted to quit the European Union, the Tories will echo the message of UK leader Boris Johnson that it is time to get Brexit done.But polls have suggested the Tories, who took  seats in Scotland in the  general election, could lose most of those seats this time round.: Jeremy Corbyn to back early general election With Brexit still unpopular in Scotland - % of voters north of the border backed Remain in  - the SNP will be hoping to make gains when voters go to the polls.Any increase in their current tally of  MPs will be interpreted by the party as a rise in support for independence.The Liberal Democrats, with Scottish MP Jo Swinson at the helm, will also be making the case for staying in the EU.They won four seats north of the border in  and will be campaigning hard in North East Fe, where Stephen Gethins, the partys Europe spokesman at Westminster, won by just two votes - giving him the smallest majority anywhere in the UK.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"general election 2019 labour leader jeremy corbyn backs early election","story":"Jeremy Corbyn told his shadow cabinet Labour would launch the \"most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen\" now a no-deal Brexit was \"off the table\".It comes ahead of the Governments bid to convince MPs to back a poll on December .Mr Corbyn told his top team on Tuesday morning: \"I have consistently said that we are ready for an election and our support is subject to a no-deal Brexit being off the table.\"We have now heard from the EU that the extension of Article  to January  has been confirmed, so for the next three months, our condition of taking no-deal off the table has now been met.\"We will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen.\"Boris Johnson will attempt to convince the Commons to vote for a December  election at his fourth time of asking on Tuesday using a short Bill which sets aside the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, requiring only a simple majority of MPs.However the Liberal Democrats and the SNP are reluctant to accept his date - fearing it allows time to bring the Withdrawal Agreement Bill before MPs ahead of the start of the campaign.They have previously signalled support for a poll on December , but could put forward a proposal for an election on December  - which the Government is likely to accept.A Number  source said: \"If theres an amendment to the th we could accept.\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"general election 2019 who is likely to win snap december poll","story":"The Governments preferred date of December  still remains the most-likely date, after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn announced that he was satisfied that Labours conditionshad been met and that he would back an election.

Its been at  per cent in the polls ever since the spring, its showed no signs of recovery.\"And just to remind you as to how bad that is, that is even less than Michael Foot got in  which is the worst modern result for the Labour Party.\"\"So for the Labour Party, it is not obvious that it should be wanting to have an early election.\"Labour strategyThe psephologist said that the strategy of Jeremy Corbyns party will be to attempt to move the focus of the campaign away from Brexit.He added: \"Thats certainly the Labour Partys hope because given that one of the consequences of last night vote the Conservatives are united on Brexit and the Labour Party is ided.\"The Labour Party certainly doesnt want this election to simply focus on the issue of Brexit.\" There remain, however, a number of iables that make this election signicantly dferent from the snap poll of , when Theresa May led the Conservatives to the most seats, but was unable to form a majority Tory Government. : SNP MP says election plans leave independence nowhereLib Dem resurgence and SNP revival The Liberal Democrats have seen a resurgence under Jo Swinson, with their unapologetically pro-Remain stance winning back some of the support they lost as a result of the coalition with the Tories. Ms Swinsons party won . per cent of the vote at the  election, with their polling in the lead-up to the vote rarely going above single figures. This year, polling shows the party on more than double their  share, with some surveys showing them as high as  per cent. Also signicant, and a potential barrier to a majority for Boris Johnsons party, is the SNP posting a much better showing that they managed in . Nicola Sturgeons party lost  MPs in that poll, with the Scottish Tory numbers boosted by an anti-independence message.The law of diminishing s suggests that strategy may not be as effective this time round, especially as the party no longer has Ruth Davidson as leader, and with all of their MPs in Scotland backing Boris Johnsons Brexit plans. However, while their current polling lead suggest the Conservatives will remain the largest party, much can change in an election campaign - andwe have been taught anything in the last few years of British politics - it is to expect the unexpected. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"these are the 20 happiest areas in scotland to live","story":"The \"Office of National Statistics asked personal well-being questions to adults in every county and council area in the UK from March  to March  to determine le satisfaction levels of the population.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MOD-GLW-19-GOLD-MEDAL-1.jpg","title":"both of this years gold medals are won by glasgow","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAfter  years living in the city, Claire and family were due to move back to her native Ness in Lewis on Monday.The -year-old teacher had previously won the Traditional Gold when the mòd was in Stornoway in . She said: “Traditional is my more natural method of singing, so it was abig challenge to go for this competition. #Kirsteen Grant, the conductor of Glasgow Islay Choir, has been a massive help to me.#It hasn#t sunk in yet that I have won. I#ve had a million things going on, but I#m sure over the next few days, once I#ve had some proper sleep, I can start to savour it.”Claire, husband Donald, and their three youngest children were all making the move north.“I won my first Gold at home and the second one in what I#d consider my second home. It#s all lovely timing,” added Claire, who topped off her successful mòd by being part of a winning quartet in a further competition on Friday.Meanwhile, a good luck message in Gaelic from favourite team Partick Thistle helped inspire men#s Gold Medal winner Ruairidh Alasdair MacLennan.Ruairidh Alasdair — a -year-old BBC sports reporter from Glasgow, who has family connections to South Uist — is a long-time season ticket holder at Firhill.He said the fact the mòd was in his home city had prompted him to take part this year following a -year gap.“I#m surprised and delighted to have won — particularly in my home city as well,” he said.“I hadn#t competed since I won the boys# silver medal in . And you know how it is — the more time goes on the less likely you are to go back to it.#But we worked hard at it, and it has gone much better than I expected.#He added: “I#m very fortunate to have had two such dedicated tutors help me along — not just to help me win the competition but even to get me singing at all.“My mother, Ishabel T Macdonald, has been involved in the traditional music scene for many years, and over the years she mentored a number of other medallists. I was fortunate to be taught by my mother, and also Kenna Campbell. I can only put on record my thanks to them.” We would like to apologise for an error in the caption which appeared on the front page of this week#s edition # Friday th October. The caption wrongly stated that Isabelle Bain and Crisdean MacKenzie were the winners of the Royal National Mòd Gold Medals when the winners were Claire Macaulay and Ruairidh Alasdair MacLennan as detailed above.Isabelle Bain won the ladies# Traditional Gold Medal, while Crisdean MacKenzie won the men#s Traditional Gold Medal.

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

completion has the potential to transform lives, commenting: “This new amenity will be a game changer for the local community, and will hopefully motivate more iniduals who lead sedentary lestyles to increase their physical activity level and enjoy the health benefits that regular exercise brings.“It’s long been our ambition to see this section of riverside trail extended and enhanced so that the

Today we come together - community, council, funders and key contributors - to celebrate its successful completion. Well done to all involved!”The completion of this second phase of works on council-owned land has created a scenic riverside trail that stretches  metres and connects Bridge Street and Gilford Community Centre to the attractive Woodlands Park, passing the iconic Gilford Mill building along the way.In addition to creating a short section of walkway over the remains of the old millrace and constructing a new footbridge across the millrace, the council undertook associated works to enhance the trail including landscaping, installing street furniture, lighting and interpretative .The second phase has been completed thanks to £, in funds allocated by SOAR’s Local Action Group. This project was part funded under Priority of the Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme - from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the European Union.Chair of SOAR ABC Roisin McAliskey added: “This project has been completed to an exceptionally high standard, and is exemplary ofhow funds from SOAR’s Rural Village Renewal scheme can be used to support the implementation of local village plans.”Open to the public since July, the new trail is already proving to be a popular destination for walkers, runners and cyclists.Welcoming completion of the trail, Jerome Burns, Contracts Manager, Southern Rural Affairs Division at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs  said: “This trail has been completed as part of a suite of village enhancement measures financed through the Village Renewal strand of the Leader Rural Development Programme. It provides a great opportunity for everyone to enjoy the many benefits of outdoor activity, and it is an excellent example of how DAERA is delivering on its vision of a ‘living, working, active landscape valued by everyone.”Given its proximity to Gilford Community Centre, this marvellous amenity set in an attractive riverside setting greatly complements the centre with its excellent indoor and outdoor facilities including a climbing wall, trim trail, picnic tables, pump track, canoe landings and beginners’ canoe slalom course.Alternative Heat are set to expand the firm Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"The council acknowledges with thanks the co-operation of the owners of Gilford Mill, Karl Asset Management, which enabled this project to proceed along with The MWA Partnership Ltd, Landscape Architects and A.G.

Founded on a cross-community basis, the idea was for people to work together where they lived and beyond, focusing on local drama at affordable prices as a ersion from – and a reaction to – rising unemployment and violence.This week, close friend and fellow North Belfast playwright Martin Lynch revealed Kate’s final play, ‘Betrothed’, will be posthumously produced at the Baby Grand, Grand Opera House, on November  and  for three performances only – with two on Saturday, November .Set against the backdrop of the  Irish rebellion, Betrothed tells the tale of one of the most remarkable love stories in Irish history.Whilst the dynamic Emmet was rallying his forces to strike a blow against the English, a remarkable young woman, Sarah Curran, was anxiously waiting his safe . Having secretly agreed to marry once the rebellion was safely out of the way, the young couple’s plans were dashed when Emmet was arrested, tried and hanged, drawn and quartered.Sarah’s story takes a further unexpected turn when she chooses to marry an officer in the British army. Caught between two worlds, can she ever forget the promises of her past Martin Lynch explained: “Kate was the main writer for Tongue ‘n’ Cheek Community Theatre company and wrote many of their plays before she passed away at Christmas before last.“When we worked together at the Community Arts Forum, she would occasionally go on about a woman called Sarah Curran. Sarah was the girlfriend of Irish rebel, Robert Emmet, he of the failed  rebellion. Later, Sarah married a British army captain, Henry Sturgenor, thus beginning one of the most remarkable love triangles in Irish history.“With Betrothed, Kate last left us a great legacy. I hope all those who were active in the community theatre movement in the s and the general public too can come along to the Baby Grand and bear witness to Kate#s final play.”Betrothed will perform at the Grand Opera House on Friday, November  at .pm and Saturday, November  at pm and .pm.Tickets are priced between £. and £. and are available from the Grand Opera House box office or, alternatively online at www.goh."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mchawk eyed gulls give big macs a miss","story":"THERE’S something strange flying high above McDonald’s at Westwoods. Is it a bird  Is it a plane  No, it’s a hawk-shaped kite designed to scare away seagulls and other sky-borne nuisances. Graciously circling overhead like birds of prey on the hunt, two faux hawks are simply attached to a line and pole, which is mounted to the roof of the fast food restaurant, rising and falling with every change in the wind. Passers-by could be forgiven for being startled when the kite is whipped into action by a gentle breeze that helps keep the seagulls at bay . Historically, seagulls have lived near the sea or sometimes beside rivers and reservoirs, but they have increasingly been found in inland towns and cities where they are often viewed as pests by the urban population.The problem is made worse by the fact that the main culprit is the herring gull – one of the largest and most aggressive members of the gull family on the island of Ireland.One reason for the growth in the number of gulls is the relative safety for the birds of perches atop man-made structures, where gulls commonly build their nests out of the reach of predators.Another reasons that gulls have moved inland is the abundant supply of food waste, which helps sustain them. No surprise, then, that they might flock to supermarkets, shops and food outlets like McDonald’s.While retailers, local government authorities, and restaurants have been keen to limit the birds’ access to food waste by using lidded bins and encouraging proper disposal, the urban gull perseveres. The daring and intelligent birds have been known to swoop down on humans to snatch food from their hands – an obvious danger when you’re trying to eat a Big Mac. While the law makes it illegal to recklessly injure or kill any gull or damage or destroy an active nest or its contents, it does, in the interest of health and safety, make allowances for certain control measures, and there are few more clever – or more humane – than the kite hawk. The urban gulls have been the subject of human concern leading, in some cases, to lethal methods of control. However, given that they are a red-list threatened species, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds questions the use of lethal control as a means of dealing with the issue.A less aggressive method of control – like that employed by McDonald’s at Westwoods – is just one solution that may help our co-habitation. At the very least, your McNuggets are somewhat safer."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pipe bomb detonated in west belfast garden","story":"WEST Belfast MP Paul Maskey has condemned a “reckless attack” on a house in West Belfast.A pipe bomb-type device detonated in the front garden of a house at Aitnamona Crescent around .pm on Saturday night.The occupant of the house reported hearing what they believed to be a firework going off.

Since I became First Minister, in December last year, we have an International Relations Minister in our Cabinet – an idea completely unthinkeable at the start of devolution. We have a highly regarded International Strategy, which is being discussed and debated across Wales.”Mr Drakeford stressed the importance of forging links between people on “dferent sides of the Irish Sea”, particularly those from “Celtic nations”.“Amongst us all are links of language, of history, of culture, of economic identity and, in many instances of progressive political outlook,” he said.“We all share the presence of a powerful neighbour, with a global and dominant language and a well-developed sense of its own signicance. In the Brexit context – and beyond it too – we have had the best results, I believe, when we have been able to work together, in an informal Celtic alliance, to provide a more powerful counterweight to hard line leave propositions than we could have mobilised working on our own.“And in the dficult days ahead, I think the effort to identy common interests, to act with a sense of solidarity in their pursuit, and to create outcomes which work for us all – that effort will be needed as never before.”"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast fancy dress fans reveal who they want to be at halloween","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Were an all-girls school that prides itself in offering a range of opportunities in terms of academic and extracurricular but underpinning everything is ensuring that their well-being is paramount.Q. What is the schools ethos A. For every pupil to reach their potential. Three years ago the girls came up with a new motto - Encourage, empower, excel.Q. Youre in your th anniversary year which you marked by planting bulbs. Tell us about that.A. The girls wanted to leave a legacy so every child from four-year-olds in Prepto my -year-old girls planted a bulb in our anniversary walkway at the front of the school. Beds were dug for every single year group, so in the springtime all of those bulbs will come out. They planted a tree too. We also decided we would have  acts of kindness.Rather than just contribute money, we asked all the girls, by inidual or class, to do an act of kindness. Weve had people out doing beach cleans, weeding gardens and a Christmas lunch for the community. Weve asked the girls to think of others rather than themselves because we do recognise that we all have good lives here.Q.

How has teaching changed over the years A. Technology is the big change. When I started I was drawing diagrams on the board in chalk. Now everything is at the flick of a switch, weve access to online videos and it has become much more visual. Every room here is equipped with an electronic whiteboard. Children are registered in the morning on computers. Gone is the letter home to parents in the schoolbag now its parentmail. Although social media gets a negative name it can work very positively because we can reach out very directly and quickly to parents. Pupils now are more aware of the world around them, and social media means theyre more exposed to dferent environments.Nicola Connery, principal of Strathearn SchoolQ. Do schools feel a bigger responsibility in the social media world A. Yes. Schools are the best portal for getting the message out, so all schools now have excellent pastoral care systems. We dont try to do it all in-house we bring in external expert agencies to empower the girls to be the best citizens that they can be and look after their personal welfare.Q. What pressures are there on the job nowadays A. Finance is the big one. Every school is having to manage a very tight budget. The other area is special educational needs. With no ing Assembly, its dficult to address either.Q. How aware are the pupils about Stormont A. We have a strong school council here were trying to teach them that debate and discussion is the right way forward for change. Weve just started a politics department, and were bringing in MLAs so the girls can put questions to them. So far the UUPs Mike Nesbitt has been here.Q. So youre offering politics at A-level now A. We always did - in collaboration with other east Belfast schools. Campbell College, Bloomfield Collegiate and Ashfield Girls and Boys have an agreement that we share subjects at A-level.Q. Tell us more about that.A. Campbell doesnt offer media studies I do it here. Campbell or Bloomfield offer German in alternate years so my girls and Bloomfield girls will go to Campbell to make a viable German class. I dont have moving image arts but Ashfield Boys has one of the best.Q. What about the problem in Northern Ireland of educating too many teachers A. Thats a yes and a no. In some areas, maybe. In the secondary sector there are still shortages in some areas such as sciences and business studies.Q. In  you were one of three principalswho teamed up against drugs. There was an e-safety booklet. How well did that initiative work, and have you had to reprimand any pupils for dabbling Nicola Connery, principal of Strathearn SchoolA. Weve never had a drugs problem here. We have excellent girls and an excellent pastoral team who regularly keep them informed on dangers and how to keep themselves safe. We are proactive.Q. Youve taught in co-educational and same-sex schools. Whats the advantage of a girls only school A. The girls dont have any gender bias towards their subject choices. Two of my top subjects are maths and physics. They also stay focused on their studies.Q. An unwelcome advance was made to one of your pupils in Bangor as she was waiting for the bus, and theres been a well-documented incident of a teacher sending inappropriate messages to a pupil at a Belfast grammar school. Do you have special classes to teach the girls about such dangers and threats A. The girls have a weekly Learning for Le and Work tutorial programme with a form tutor and the element that deals with such matters is personal development.Q. In  a pupil, Catherine Buchanan, died from leukaemia. Another, Holly Massey, was diagnosed with a rare brain tumour last year. It cant be easy coping with that A. We are a family at Strathearn and we have a strong sense of community. Last year we raised £, in one week. That showed to me what a special school this is and just how much we care about each other. When something dficult comes we really pull together.Q How important is academic success A. It opens doors and allows the girls to move forward but in this day and age it must be balanced with a skill set.Nicola Connery, principal of Strathearn SchoolThis year our exam results were our best ever. At GCSE .% got  A*s to C, but .% of those grades were A* A - so over  of our grades out of  were A* A. And A-levels were our best ever - .% were  A* to C but % of those were As or A*s.

We are where we are, as a Garda sergeant said to us last night, it is steel and glass and plastic, they are all replaceable.“It’s important to say that there’s only one person responsible for what happened here the other night and that’s the person who did it. They’re the only ones responsible for that. I want to make that clear.”He said since the attack, he has received thousands of messages of solidarity and support for him and his family.Mr Kenny called ongoing demonstrations being held by Ballinamore Community Group against plans to home asylum seekers in Ballinamore “regrettable.”“The situation in Ballinamore has become a very tense and dficult situation. To say it is regrettable is an understatement,” he said.“The handful of people who are at the head of that really need to look at what happens when you fire things up to a high level and what impact that has, and the consequences it has, which is beyond their control,” he said.In a statement, Ballinamore Community Group condemned the attack on Mr Kenny and said the demonstrations will continue.“The demonstration in Ballinamore has been conducted in a peaceful and respectful manner and it is our firm commitment that it will continue in the same way.

It can charge advertisers morethey want to narrow ad delivery to people who have visited certain locations.The Australian commission began proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia alleging Google breached the law through a series of on-screen representations made as users set up Google accounts on their Android phones and tablets.Mr Sims said these on-screen representations meant Google collected, kept and used highly sensitive data about consumers’ location “without them making an informed choice”.“This is a world-first case,” he said. “This action — in relation to misrepresentations in relation to the data Google collects, keeps and uses — has never been taken before.”Google said it was reviewing the allegations.“We continue to engage with the ACCC and intend to defend this matter,” the company said in a statement.When people had their Location History turned off, they may have felt that Google was not collecting their location data and recording it and keeping it, but in fact they wereRod SimsThe AP investigation found that even with Location History turned off, Google stores user location when, for instance, the Google Maps app is opened, or when users conduct Google searches that are not related to location.Automated searches of the local weather on some Android phones also store the phone’s whereabouts.Earlier, business news site Quartz found that Google was tracking Android users by collecting the addresses of nearby mobile phone towers evenall location services were off. Google changed the practice and insisted it never recorded the data.The Australian commission alleges that between January  and late , people setting up their Google accounts on phones and tablets would have incorrectly believed that Location History was the only setting that affected whether the company was collecting a user’s location data.“When people had their Location History turned off, they may have felt that Google was not collecting their location data and recording it and keeping it, but in fact they were,” Mr Sims said.He said the watchdog believes some of the alleged behaviour has continued. His commission will ask Google to admit the actions and promise to stop.The commission also plans to ask the court to impose penalties, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"us air forces mystery space plane back on earth after twoyear mission","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Therefore, John decided that any money raised would go to the same charity.Between both the coffee morning and John’s sponsored silence over pound, was raised and a few late donations have been filtering in.Speaking to the Derry News at the weekend John said of the challenge: “I didn’t speak until I came out of the school at  o’clock. It was tough enough. My wee girls were saying, ‘try not to break it’, but it was hard because I’m used to rambling on.“The principal was taunting away at me, saying ‘John, ye haven’t seen the caretaker ’ and I would shake my head, then he’d go, ‘do ye know where he is ’ and I would just shake my head again.“And someone of the kids, the primary  pupils, would say ‘gone speak to me’, so they were doing a bit of taunting too. But they couldn’t break me.”John has his sights set on another charity fundraiser after Christmas when he plans on walking from Derry to Buncrana and back again - he says Macmillan will most likely be the beneficiary again.Sadly, a number of John’s close family have had cancer and he appreciates the emotional, physical and financial support the charity offers.“They’re known as the ‘little angels’ and they do a great job.

The Department of Education has however told this paper that a petition signed by parents and pupils at the school will be taken into account by the Permanent Secretary. Parents were “devastated’ when first informed of proposals to close the Coshquin school after a letter was sent out asking them to attend a meeting with Education Authority officials back in April. Parents and schoolchildren from Groarty P.S. then hand delivered letters to education chief, Derek Baker, when he visited Derry imploring him to reconsider. googletag.cmd.push Due to uncertainty surrounding the future of the school, a number of parents have taken the dficult decision to transfer their children to another school. One such parent, Diana McLaughlin, whose son and daughter attended the school, said: We actually ended up leaving the school. The uncertainty was a bit too much for us. I didnt need the hardship of worrying about finding an appropriate school later so I moved my son to St.Patricks where we have other children in the family there. Her son, Haiden, misses Groarty IPS terribly and found the transition to a new school very dficult but is now settling in well. Mrs McLaughlin added: With transfer tests looming, we really wanted to get them settled before all that work kicked off. She paid tribute to the hard-working staff at Groarty IPS who had a great relationship with the children and persevered in trying circumstances. Over the weekend, a spokesperson for the Department of Education stated said the Department’s formal consultation period does not close until the th November. “Whilst the Education Authority’s consultation process closed in June, no decision willbe taken on the future of the school until closure of this statutory stage of the process. “The Department has received a petition from parents and pupils and this will be considered along with the Case for Change before a decision is taken by the Permanent Secretary in the continued absence of a Minister.” History The school has a capacity for  pupils and it was anticipated that by transforming from a controlled primary school to a controlled integrated primary school in  that numbers were going to swell. Since then however pupil numbers each year have fluctuated between  and  – that may be less for the   school year given recent departures. The school has been a part of the local community for over  years. It attained Integrated status in  and is the only school with Integrated status on the West Bank of the city. The Education Authority’s consultation document made reference to the other integrated school in the city, Oakgrove Integrated P.S., which operates “near to or over capacity” and therefore couldn’t accommodate pupils from Groarty P.S. It does however highlight other schools closest to Groarty P.S., such as Irish Medium School Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige and Catholic Maintained Schools St Eithne’s and Holy Family P.S., which the EA says have many unfilled places. The EA argues that the school’s enrolment falls “well short” of the Sustainable Schools Policy criteria for primary schools, set at  pupils for a rural school and  pupils for an urban school. And says in addition there are more than two year groups within a classroom as the school operates as a three teacher school. The EA has a duty to encourage, facilitate and promote shared education. And Groarty CIPS has over the past number of years engaged in Shared Education with Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige. Both schools previously made a joint submission under the Shared Education Campuses Programme for a shared campus. However, in consideration of the numbers of Groarty CIPS and the proposed campus, the Education Authority did not endorse Groarty CIPS’s submission as it would “not provide for a sustainable education campus.” At the time staff, parents and pupils of the two schools staged a protest march.

Specic to the introduction of this equipment, we will be creating three jobs within the team, to include two regional sales managers and a production manager.“This project is running in tandem with our ambitious expansion to a new poundm facility on the outskirts of Strabane that will house our company’s entire business operations and incorporate the introduction of the new production line for the Structured Insulated Panels .”Chair of the Local Action Group of the Derry and Strabane Rural Partnership, Councillor Jim McKeever, said: “Our Rural Business Investment Scheme has exceeded all expectations and has played a vital role in our local economy and made a signicant impact on our rural community.“We were inundated with applications throughout each of the six rounds of funding, and we worked meticulously with applicants to guide them through each stage of the application process, ensuring they had their business plan developed, match funding secured, planning permission granted for any building works, and the necessary quotations in place for equipment or services.“This attention to detail has allowed our scheme to allocate all of our budget, as well as exceed our targets in terms of numbers of businesses supported and actual job creation.”The Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme - is funded by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the European Union . The LEADER Fund is administered by Derry City and Strabane District Council on behalf of Derry and Strabane Rural Partnership.DAERA Deputy Secretary Fiona McCandless said: “Derry and Strabane Rural Partnership Local Action Groupreceived poundm from DAERA to deliver a range of schemes under the Rural Development ‘LEADER’ programme to support rural communities through investment in businesses, community services and village infrastructure.

The -year old is now a free agent after the playing season ended and is considering his options, although it is still possible he could stay at the Brandywell having already had discussions on a new contract with Declan Devine.Yet with Perth also a big fan of Sloggett, it seems likely that the midfielder will have no shortage of options before he commits to playing next year.Sloggett, like his manager and team mates, was in celebratory mood after Derry City defeated Finn Harps - on Friday night to seal European football next season , an achievement which Devine described as his greatest of his managerial career.We were selling a pipedream to players in December,” he stated. “The place didnt have the most positive feel about it when we came in last November because of the season last year.“Weve been magnicent. We went to very dficult venues and performed and to see the Brandywell full again, thats definitely my biggest achievement. Lets see where we go in the future but this is a night Ill not forget for a long time. googletag.cmd.push  Change for the betterThe feeling at the Brandywell on Friday night was in stark contrast to the mood around the club at this stage just twelve months ago, after an eighth place finish in the Premier Division. So much has changed in such a short time. I didnt really think about achieving Europe to be honest, Devine continued. I wanted us to get a good start and see where we were. I wanted a team that reflects the passion of the football club and honesty and work ethic of the football club.I watched last year and teams were coming from Dublin and Cork and they were walking in here and walking back out with three points and I didnt like that. Our guys fight for the club, fight for the city and fight for their families. “Add into that theyre not only fighting but putting on a brilliant display of attacking football, scoring a lot of goals and creating a lot of chances. “The players deserve huge credit and Im just over the moon for them.It has undoubtedly been a successful season for Devine, his staff and his players, but the City boss is not content, and wants even further progress next season. We finished fourth but we want to push on and get better next year,” he insisted.It takes a lot of effort but Im very fortunate that I have Kevinand Paddyand Martyand Declan McIntrye and all the backroom team pulling in the one direction. Those guys have put their le and soul into it.Theres a lot of good people at this football club. We all share a work ethic and we all work extremely hard.Coming off the pitch there was supporters there who were eight, nine,  years of age. There were supporters who were in their s.Its a fantastic night for us but we have to strive to get better and not pat ourselves on the back too much. “Its going to be harder next year and Im sure a lot of clubs will put a lot of investment into it.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They issued some pointers on how to keep your animals safe: Microchipping The ISPCA strongly recommend that all dog owners have their pet’s microchipped in case they are taken or go missing over Halloween. This is a legal requirement for all dogs and puppies once they are  weeks old and failure to do so is an offence under the Animal Health  Welfare Act  . Dog owners need to be in possession of a microchipping certicate also so it is important your contact details are kept up-to-date. It is the pet owner’s responsibility to inform the database operator of any change of contact details so once your dog has been microchipped, check the database to ensure your details are correct. googletag.cmd.push If your pet becomes lost, having them microchipped is the best way to ensure they will be reunited with you as it’s the first thing a veterinary practice, rescue centre or dog warden do is to scan your pet for a microchip. Lost animals puts a lot of extra pressure on animal rescue centres, dog pounds and veterinary practices but it also causes more upset for pets and their owners so don’t delay and get your dog microchipped today – it’s the law!. While microchipping is recommended for all cat owners as well as dogs, there are no current plans to make microchipping compulsory for cats. Help your pets during Halloween Pet owners can help train their dogs and cats to become accustomed to the sounds of Halloween fireworks by playing similar sounds at low volumes. As dficult as it may be, try not to react to your pet showing signs of fear as it may be the best way you can help them. Licking objects such as toys filled with treats may help ease your pet’s stress. If they are up for it, playing with them may also be a welcome distraction, but don’t force ityour pet is too upset to play. Walk your dog in the morning and earlier evening away from any fireworks. If you are concerned that your pet is unmanageably terried of the noise of fireworks, you should consult your vet to discuss ways for managing your pet’s stress. Outdoor pets including small mammals or birds should also be brought indoors into a secure garage or shed where they can be secure from any loud noise or fireworks. You can also cover hutches or cages with blankets to act as sound-proofing. Horses, ponies and donkeys should also be microchipped, and those that live in areas with a considerable amount of Halloween-related noise should be securely stabled to prevent them from escaping or hurting themselves. Keep sweets and decorations out of reach Dogs and cats should be kept away from sweets and Halloween decorations. Chocolate and raisins are highly toxic to pets, as are any sweets containing the sugar substitute xylitol. Ingesting foil or plastic wrappers can also lead to digestive problems and may require surgery. If your pet does ingest something toxic, contact your vet immediately. Beware of costumes Not all pets will tolerate wearing costumes and it may cause them undue stress. Only dress up your pet for Halloweenyou know they enjoy it. Halloween themed bandanas can be less restrictive soyou do choose to put your pet in a costume, make sure it does not limit the animal’s movement, vision, ability to breathe or behave normally. Also ensure any costume doesn’t have any small, chewable pieces or toxic paints or dyes. People wearing Halloween costumes can be equally as scary to pets. Masks or other costume accessories may trigger their territorial instincts. While people might enjoy being spooked during the Halloween festivities, it’s not fun for pets. If your pet is scared, ensure they are in a separate room and safe place. Look out for wildle Hedgehogs go into hibernation this time of year and will sleep in woodpiles or heavy scrub and leaves. It is important you check under all woodpiles before lighting any bonfires to ensure there is no wildle hibernating. Some outdoor decorations such a fake spider webs or string lights can snare wild animals, so be careful about hanging them and remove them after the festivities. Report animal cruelty Unfortunately, stray animals can fall victim to abuse or cruel Halloween pranks. If you witness animal cruelty, contact your local Garda station immediately and the ISPCA National Animal Cruelty Helpline on  orreport online. ISPCA Public Relations Manager Carmel Murray said:“While we all enjoy the festivities of Halloween, many pets and wildle will find this time of year terrying. It is important that they have a secure place to hide indoorsthey are frightened by the noises of fireworks and trick-or-treaters calling to the door. Leaving the lights low, and playing the radio or television can help drown out some of the sounds as it can be a stressful time for them. It is also important our pets are kept safe in a secure room where they cannot dart out an open door. If your pet manages to escape, it is important they are wearing an ID tag plus they should be microchipped, which is a legal requirement for all dogs and puppies once they are  weeks old. Pets that have been found will be scanned for a microchip which holds the pet owners contact details so it is important this information is kept up to date. Carmel added: Halloween can also be a dangerous time for our wildle so it is important to check under wood, scrub and leaves for hibernating hedgehogs before lighting any bonfires. Sadly stray animals can fall victim to abuse or cruel Halloween pranks soyou witness any animal cruelty, contact your local Garda station immediately and report it to the ISPCA National Animal Cruelty Helpline on   .”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

She insists that she intends to deliver the authentic voice of moderate, progressive Irish nationalism in a place where it needs to be heard.And she has vowed to be a hard working Peer, lobbying and building alliances with other peers and parties across the chamber that will bring benefit to people in Northern Ireland.And while the former MP regrets no longer being a member of the SDLP, she said her political views have not altered and will reflect the partyrsquos central social democratic messages focused on the needs of people and the principles of equality, fairness and social justice for all in the House of Lords.With her new title now confirmed, Baroness Ritchie described Downpatrick as a ldquohistoric place on the island of Ireland, where St Patrick began and ended his ministry.ldquoThe town is a place of immense heritage and has a longstanding history. It is uniquely associated on the island with the patron saint and is also associated with the Normans and the Vikings, she continued.ldquoDownpatrick is also place of inclusion and a shared society. The area was one of the first to share power at local government level and in the days of the old Urban Council, it had responsibility for allocating housing and did so very much on the basis of need.The Baroness said the Downpatrick area was very much at the vanguard of political inclusion in terms of ensuring that people belonged, explaining that she plans to use her new title to promote the town.Her House of Lords induction takes place on November  with her formal introduction taking place the following day when she will be introduced by her two sponsors on the floor of the chamber.Baroness Ritchiersquos sponsors will be former Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Lord Paul Murphy and Baroness Angela Smith, who is the shadow leader of the Lords.She is also former NIO minister who was responsible for the the health, economy and environment portfolios during her time at Stormont.Lord Murphy was also Minister of State and led the British Government in the talks process that led to the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie continued: ldquoI have picked my two sponsors on the basis that while I am going into the House of Lords as non-aligned and independent, my two sponsors understand the mechanics of the Good Friday Agreement and understand inclusion and power-sharing.ldquoMy maiden speech will hopefully take place sometime before the end of the year, although that could be subject to changea general election is called.Looking to the future, the Baroness said she has been using the past few weeks to get briefed on key issues which are important to her, including Brexit and its impact on the agri-food economy and local economy.ldquoTo me, there is no such thing as a good Brexit. The best deal for me is one where we will remain in the EU. What we have been presented with is one that is a bita curatersquos egg in many ways. There will ne no hard border which means no economic border and no veto in terms of the Assembly. Having said that, I am going to have to examine the Brexit deal in greater depth, she continued.ldquoThere are other issues that I want to focus on including the contaminated bloods issue, tourism VAT and what can be done to help our economy and ensure that we can grow and develop. The vaginal mess issue is something I have been associated with as is the importance of the Co Down fishing industry.Baroness Ritchie said while she does not have constituents, she will be speaking in a general Northern Ireland-wide context.ldquoI will be highlighting the importance of reflecting our political ersity and respect for political dference, ensuring that our institutions are up and running and that they respect the relationships between Ireland and Britain and Northern Ireland and the South.

The three of them were regularly checking the weather in the last few weeks leading up to race day as the temperatures were well up in the high s.Far too hot to be running a marathon, but thankfully in the final week it took a dramaticdown to nine degrees. Flying over on Friday with no time to waste, it was straight to the hotel and then immediately to the Expo to pick up their race numbers and buy some of the many race souvenirs that were on sale.In the Expo there was a wall of fame for all the runners who had completed the six majors. Murlough ACrsquos very own Paula McKibbin and Ann McAlarneyrsquos names were spotted on the wall for all to see.There was no time to get over the six-hours jet lag as they were all up at five in the morning and headed downtown to the start of the km friendship run.This was a bit of fun and involved a quick lap of the city centre finishing in Grant park. The rest of the day was spent in true MAC style with a boat cruise along the Chicago river before dinner in an Italian restaurant.The evening got better as needing a taxi for six people to take them back to the hotel, they managed to acquire the use of a party limousine at a very good rate.Another early start on Sunday as the marathon began at .am in the neighbouring Grant Park. Thankfully, it was only a  minute walk from the hotel. Theyrsquod only just made it into the corrals and the race started.A field of , runners, heading off north through the city, with defending champion Mo Farah expected to retain his title.As the route wound through the city it passed through many dferent districts, all with a party atmosphere and lined with people cheering and screaming encouragement.The noise during a major marathon in the USA is beyond belief, the bands playing, spectators lsquohigh fivingrsquo and the streets lined with people three or four thick is an experience like no other. We passed through the Mexican Quarter with bands playing and guys dancing, wearing sombreros and then on to Chinatownrsquo with the streets lined with drummers.It was then onto the Gay Quarter with drag queens performing on stage. It was a celebration for both runners and spectators.As with all marathons, the last five miles were a real test of mental determination as fatigue kicked in and Carol, unfortunately, was suffering from a knee injury that she picked up during training which ed at mile .They all pushed on with Hugh crossing the line first and recording a new personal best by one and a half minutes. Orla was next home followed by Charisse who recorded a huge personal best of  minutes.Carol was next home and managed to finish in a respectable time as she battled through the final  miles with knee problems. As the runners walked down the street after finishing they were greeted by four lines of local school kids applauding and congratulating all the runners. After the kids there were long tables either side of the street where one of the local sponsors, which happened to be a brewery, handing out free beer. Then onto the next table where they were given food and water.It makes you wonder what is not to like about this marathon  In the ladiesrsquo race a new world record was set as Brigid Kosgei beat Paula Radclfersquos record of  years. Ironically, as Carol finished her race and walked down to collect her medal she was presented with it from no other than Paula herself.It was back to the hotel to get ready for dinner that evening. As Hugh and Charisse walked back they talked about getting a pint of milk each for recovery.As the shop was a ten-minute walk away, Charisse said that even though she knew it would be a bit more expensive she was happy to buy milk for them both in the hotel bar.Being content with the two half pints that the bar served it was only when the bill was produced that they both discovered that they must have drunk the most expensive two glasses of milk ever, with a bill of  dollars. Anything to save tired feet.That evening they continued in MAC style, celebrating with a meal on Cindyrsquos roof top restaurant followed by a few beers in Buddy Guyrsquos Blues bar where we were treated in style with a table in the VIP area. The le of a Murlough AC member is indeed a good one and already planning has begun for the next Major.Meanwhile, the week before, Kieran McShane made the long trek to Australia to complete in the Melbourne Marathon.The race began with an early am start along Batman Avenue in the glorious sunshine. This was Kieranrsquos first big run in over three months due to injuries, so took him a lot longer to finish, but he says it just meant he had more time to take in the lovely views of Melbourne.It was an amazing race from start to finish taking in all the iconic places around Melbourne such as St Paulrsquos Cathedral, Flinders Street, Botanic Gardens and the Shrine of Remembrance.Followed by a lap around the GP circuit then up and down St Kildarsquos beach along the promenade.

The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things.

This is Britain, this doesn’t happen in Britain this is not how we do business’. And then I had that sense that something was broken in Northern Ireland...I started getting the sense that something was fundamentally broken in Northern Ireland, which made me sad because even though I’ve spent  years away at sea in the Navy and doing ious things I’ve always had my home in Northern Ireland, my eldest kids and now my youngest kids have been educated in Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland has got so many advantages going for it.”Mr Aiken said that what he had heard over the intervening years had left him “quite concerned” that there was “institutional corruption” within aspects of Northern Irish society.However, Mr Aiken made clear that he was staunchly unionist and, despite voting remain in the EU referendum, he was totally opposed to a border poll.The Ballyclare man said that after leaving the Navy he lived in Dublin and loved both the city and Irish people. However, he said that his eyes were opened by the high taxes, health insurance charges, huge rent and childcare costs and infrastructure problems in areas such as water treatment which resulted in water periodically having to be boiled before drinking.• Background information on Steve AikenSteve Aiken, whose father was a trade union official, said that his own politics were “one nation Labour or even one nation centrist Conservativeism”. and Ronan Hughes. \"   and Ronan Hughes. \"  ESSEX LORRY DEATHS LATEST | Police hunt N.I. brothers wanted on suspicion of manslaughter of  men and women found dead in refrigerated trailer in EssexPolice probe kidnap attempt in Milton Keynes Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Aiken is not a member of any of the loyal orders - although he is Freemason.Mr Aiken said he was “very supportive of the loyal orders” and attends the Twelfth.

After three years supporting a ravaged Conservative government, the DUP were thrown to the EU wolves . Boris Johnson in the House of Commons on Saturday in the debate on his Brexit plan. He slapped down the concerns of Mr Dodds, and even expressed regret that anyone would seek to use a vetoNext time they invite a Tory conference speaker they should insist on him taking a lie detector test .The wilful ruthless and vicious resolve of Boris Johnson to devalue the Union was clear. The level of chicanery the Tories are prepared to stoop to knows no bounds..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The intention to damage and weaken the Union and in particular our constitutional status was exposed for all to see.When it came to capitulation to the EU bully boys demands on behalf of the Irish, the Boris Brexit betrayal of unionists was completed without resistance. Letter to the editorAs Ben Lowry asserted in his column ‘Middle England chose Brexit over NI fully in UK,’ October , Boris Johnson’s loyalty is first and foremost to the Conservative party and its English electorate. It was always going to be the case and therein lies the harsh lesson for unionism to learn . It is imperative that unionists consolidate and ensure that maintaining the Union remains in our own hands. That is the battle line drawn for the next election when unionists bite the bullet andthe maximum number of MPs possible to hold firm for the unionist cause .We have been here before with shyster prime ministers and survived. This time we now know in advance where we all stand in terms of having our unionism undermined. What unionism requires are cool heads, sharp minds and positive leadership as never before . Solidarity tied into a unity of defence and purpose in upholding the integrity of the Union and reasserting our right to self determination is the number one unionist priority.David McNarry, Comber©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  -- -- People   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           People      Mother tells of agony after sons body found - PSNI launch investigationThe mother of a man who had been reported missing has told of her anguish after his body was found.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees. I liked the chanting, lsquoclimate justice nowrsquo but this is not just fun to shout, itrsquos actually really important.Sister Lily-Rose Kitchiner, , said: ldquoPeople in places like Africa suffer because of how we live here and it needs to stop. The government needs to do more to stop climate change.ldquoI donrsquot know why we have to tell them this, why donrsquot they think itrsquos important Penarth resident and leader of Wales Green Party, Anthony Slaughter, also attended the march. He said: \"The massive turnout for the climate strike march in Cardf showed the strength of feeling from all sections of our community on the ongoing crisis and the impacts already being felt across the world.\"While people of all ages were present, this was a day when young voices were prominent with speaker after speaker articulating their generations anger at government inertia. This was a day for politicians to listen and take real, meaningful action to tackle the climate emergency.\"Business as usual is no longer an option.\"The Welsh Government has declared a ldquoclimate emergency and set a target to cut carbon emission by  per cent by .Millions of people across the globe have joined the strikes, with major cities brought to a stand-still.Greta Thunberg, the -year-old who sparked the movement with a solitary protest outside Swedish parliament in August  tweeted: ldquoChange is coming. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections. We must resist Tory attempts to close down our democracy. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We need a UK Labour Government that will stand up for the many.The Tories have been cutting budgets for nearly  years now.Since  they have scrapped over , frontline police officers.In the last year alone more than , children were pushed into absolute poverty.Boris Johnson has sought to ide our country.Labour would immediately raise the minimum wage to pound an hour for all ages, increase funding to Welsh Government for the NHS, and kickstart a green revolution.On Saturday it is expected that MPs willto Westminster to sit for a highly unusual session in Parliament, as we reach the critical stage of the Brexit process.Weekend sittings are very rare, and the House has only sat on four Saturdays since  ndash on September ,  at the outbreak of World War II on July , as a final summer sitting on November ,  to debate the Suez Crises and on April ,  over the Falkland Islands invasion.A Saturday sitting, two days after the EU summit, is likely to be a decisive moment in determining the future of our country.Saturday will also see a lsquoTogether for the Final Sayrsquo march to Parliament Square.When a similar march took place earlier this year an estimated million people of all ages, from every corner of the UK and from all walks of le, took part ndash including many from Penarth and Cardf who travelled to London to make their voices heard.Their message was absolutely clear then ndash and mine remains the same now - that the people must be given a final say on this Brexit disaster. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years.

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey.

We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year.
